I’m in college now and far removed from the incident I’m about to describe to you.  I’m thankful I made it out alive. Not everyone did. The therapist said I should go my best to put it behind me and not think about it.

But I can’t help it. It’s all still very vivid in my mind. Like it was just yesterday. Like I’m still back there. Back in the Alexia days.

Alexia….

I’m not gonna lie. Alexia was my first love. And I still love her. Despite everything.

I was 17 and approaching the end of my senior year. I’d already been accepted to the state university in the following fall. I’d already won a pretty nice scholarship for music. I had great friends and I had Alexia.

I’d been dating Alexia all year. She was sort of an unlikely match for me, I guess. At least, that’s what my surviving friends told me after it was over. For a long time, they swore up and down that she put a spell on me, that I didn’t really love her.

I dunno. Maybe she did. If so, it worked. I’m still waiting for it to wear off.

You see, here’s what was sort of unique about Alexia. She was a witch.

I guess, these days, practicing witchcraft isn’t all that unique. From what I can tell, it appears to be a pretty big trend. Especially among the middle school and high school scene.

What made it unique in our case was that I wouldn’t normally be the “type” to be into the “type” that was into witchcraft. I was in the so-called “popular” crowd. My family went to church on Sundays. Although, they’d quit making me go by the seventh grade.

I liked to be outside to do stuff like jog, ride my bike, play sports… Alexia liked to be outside to… I don’t know, collect berries, stones, and leaves for what she called, “spellwork.”

Truthfully, my friend group made fun of girls like Alexia. But hey, I’m not the type to judge anyone. If you want to believe the full moon has power, fairies are real, and you can hex away your enemies, be my guest! No judgment here.

I’ll admit, in my head, I really didn’t take it seriously. But, I can also admit that I was very wrong..

My story really began at Alexia’s Beltane party.

Alexia had been blabbing about Beltane for two  months leading up to it. Apparently, it’s some specifically magical day all about rebirth, growing, and “blossoming.” She’d even at one point mentioned it had to do with rabbits giving birth to tons of baby rabbits, so the day was often used for sex magic by some witches.

As a seventeen year old dude, I can assure you, I only heard “sex magic,” and just like that, Beltane was my favorite day of the year!

But anyway, here in reality, Beltane basically means, “May 1st.” Yep, that’s basically it. All sorts of celebration and festivity because it’s… May 1st.

Hey whatever, right? Most of the world gets totally caught up in consumer capitalist greeting card holidays, so why not assign spiritual significance to May 1st? To each his own.

This particular Beltane was supposed to be especially magical because it also happened to be a full moon that year. Alexia was positively delighted by the prospect.

So, in honor of the day, she decided to throw a small party. Alexia lived with her single dad who was never home and had no siblings. So, it wasn’t that difficult for her to organize a gathering. My friends hadn’t really meshed that much with her friends; maybe it was because she referred to her friend group as the “coven.” But, I might have mentioned the whole sex magic thing, so a couple of my friends had even agreed to come to this bash.

It was a Friday night after everyone had eaten dinner at home and made up excuses to get out for the night that were something other than going to a sex magic party at the senior class witch’s house. Actually, I was a hundred percent certain no sex, magic or any sort, would be transpiring that Beltane evening. But, I had been hearing about the whole thing so much and for so long by then, I couldn’t help but feel a little excited. I felt like something was going to happen.

Little did I know, that’s called intention. I was practicing witchcraft, and I didn’t even know it just then.

It was a gorgeous warm evening. It had rained the day before and everything still had that luscious spring smell. The breeze outside was just perfect, not too intrusive, just enough to make the newly bloomed leaves in the trees toss gently and peacefully. Birds were chirping. The neighborhood was busy with people walking their dogs, kids playing pick up games, and music going by floating out the car windows people had rolled down to let in the evening air. Various smells of barbequing meats drifted over everything; that singularly summery smell.

At school earlier that day, Alexia had looked every bit the part of the perfect Beltane witch. I had no idea what such a thing should look like, but when I saw her, I decided that was it. She’d been wearing a long patchwork dress with a huge billowing skirt and short sleeves that hung low on her shoulders. Her waist length black hair had toppled freely down her back. Small sections of it were braided in tight little plaits with ribbons and little white daisies woven in. She and “the coven” had apparently taken turns “tattooing” one another, as they each had intricate and admittedly beautiful designs drawn all over their hands. At lunch time, I had held her hands and studied them. The ink was black and gold and there were lots of flourishes and beautiful and weird symbols. She told me they were sigils and the ink was called henna. I didn’t know what that meant, but it made my heart flutter a little to trace over all the marks with my finger tip.

See? Magic. It’s real. Much more real than most people think.

I arrived at her house that evening with my friends Brad and Aiden. I was low key worried about how they would behave. I was about 85% sure I could count on them not to be idiots to Alexia. But I wasn’t so sure about the coven. One person in the coven was a dude. His name was Carter and sometimes he wore eyeliner. I really hoped my friends would not embarrass me or make me put them in check. On the other hand, they were pretty committed to the whole sex magic idea, and even though I told them not to get their hopes up AT ALL, they seemed like they’d be on their best behavior.

We pulled into one of the gravel spots in front of Alexia’s house. Her place was one of those houses that is neither small nor big. It’s pretty nondescript and just comfortable. That evening though, the windows were opening and I could hear Fiona Apple drifting out, along with the heady scent of cloves. It wasn’t dark yet but the twilight gloom had begun to gather and I could see candles of a variety of colors flickering in the windows. There were also voices and laughter inside, and I had the slightly thrilling feeling again, like something wonderful was on the horizon. Not even sex magic, I’m being serious. Everything just felt… Special. I don’t know how to describe it. But I was beginning to think there was more to this Beltane thing than I thought.

“What’s up, Blake!”

My heart fluttered as we walked in the door with me in the lead, and Alexia’s friend Vesper called out to me. I smiled shyly and gave her a small wave. Brad and Aiden however gave loud boisterous greetings to Vesper, pushing past me and attempting to hug her, which she easily deflected. They were never this friendly to the coven. But, Vesper was admittedly one of the prettiest people I’d ever seen in real life with her tall muscular form and masses of wavy sun lightened hair. I instantly began regretting bringing these idiots, but Vesper seemed slightly less annoyed with them than usual. So maybe it could still work out.

There were other voices coming from points unknown in the house, along with the unmistakable smell of a fire wafting in from the back yard. One of the other coven members, Minsy, bounced into the small front room in which we were standing. “Oh, hey, Blake!” Minsy exclaimed. She was the polar opposite of Vesper in basically every way. My dill weed buddies often referred to the two as “Daphne and Velma.” And they were not nearly evolved enough to realize that being compared to Velma was a good thing.

Minsy bopped over to me and gave me a big warm hug for such a small person. “I’ll tell Alexia you’re here!” she said.

“It’s OK, where is she?” I asked. “I’ll just go to her!”

“There’s a fire pit in the backyard, she’s out there,” Vesper explained just before she and Minsy lost interest in us and carried on toward the kitchen.

Brad and Aiden had never been over there with me before so I led them out of the front room, down a short hall, and into the family room, which would then take us to the back door. As we passed through the family room, I noticed Carter. He was reclined on a couch in the furthest recess of the room. The quick onset of evening dark had caught him there and he would’ve been entirely hidden by it if it weren’t for the light of his phone. He was reading from his phone. His eyes darted momentarily toward me. He gave me the tiniest hint of a smile, but not exactly a welcoming one.

More like a “wait and see” smile.

It could be just my mind playing tricks on me, remembering it that way… But yeah, it seemed like Carter knew some secret, I think. But he quickly returned his attention to his phone and I realized I probably imagined it.

Finally, I showed my buddies out the back door, down two steps, and into Alexia’s backyard. In the infinitesimal time since we’d arrived, night had almost completely stolen in and only the slightest hint of daylight was left, and it was gone in seconds.

Alexia’s yard  was surrounded by a nine foot tall wood fence that made it feel strangely isolated from the rest of the active neighborhood. There was a pretty decent above ground pool in one corner of the yard, still closed until warmer weather came. The music originated from a bluetooth sound bar there in the yard too and Alexia was dancing as the vibrant firelight played on her beautiful face.

The whole effect of the place gave me the disorienting feeling that I’d been instantly plucked out of my own world and inserted into Alexia’s magical one.

Her friend Harriet, the last member of the coven, was sitting in a chair, smoking a clove cigarette and watching Alexia dance. She obviously saw us walk into the yard but ignored us completely. That was just how Harriet was. I couldn’t have said a word just then because my breath was caught in my lungs watching Alexia’s body move fluidly in the firelight and the night breeze, her eyes closed, her chin lifted toward whatever gods she believed in. I would’ve been perfectly happy standing there for all of eternity and just watching her. But of course, my idiot buddies had to laugh and crack wise, causing Alexia’s eyes to snap open and the spell to be broken.

“Oh hey, baby!” Alexia said. She bound barefoot across the yard, her billowy skirt swaying around the slight curve of her hips. Then, she wrapped her arms around me and curled her body against me.

Brad and Aiden began to hoot, holler, and howl at the full moon which was now high in the sky, like some sort of deranged brain damaged wolves. I *definitely* regretted bringing them.

Later, I would come to regret bringing them more than anything I’d ever regretted before nor will I ever regret anything else as much…

Eventually, everyone had made their various ways back out into the yard. Even Carter finally got tired of zoning on his phone and joined the rest of us around the fire. Brad and Aiden however, soon got antsy as they were too stupid to sit still for more than seventeen seconds. So, while I hung around the fire with the coven, they found a baseball and began tossing it back and forth over by the pool. I decided it was good to have them occupied. Like finding something fun for the toddlers to do so the adults could enjoy some quiet time.

This was my first time being with the entire coven at one time outside of school. The moon hung swollen above our heads as though it was watching and waiting for us to do a trick. The glow of the fire was almost as enchanting as my Alexia. She sat curled on my lap with a blanket around her shoulders and both of us stared mesmerized into the fire.

Carter had brought out a guitar and strummed it quietly, playing some moody song; it sounded like Hozier. I supposed witchy chicks probably dug moody musicians like Hozier; Carter might have found a good high school niche after all. Minsy and Vesper were cuddled together on one of the oversized yard chairs, and Harriet remained alone, shuffling and reshuffling a deck of tarot cards.

I had also never heard of tarot cards before Alexia came into my frame of reference. I still didn’t know that much about them.

And then, Harriet asked me if I’d like a reading. “Just a one card pull,” she said. She was across the fire from me and even in the warm light, she still managed to look pale and drawn with dark shadows under her eyes. She wore a cold smirk and her dark eyes sparkled mischievously.

I smiled, trying to be friendly even though I could tell Harriet was somehow making fun of me. “I uh, don’t really know what that means.”

“You don’t know what a tarot reading is?” she asked.

Tarot had been one of the many topics that Alexia had probably described to me numerous times, but sometimes I got really fixated on her red lips moving and couldn’t hear anything she was saying. So I only had a very vague idea. “Like some kind of fortune telling thing?” I guessed. “Like revealing the future or something?”

Harriet gave a curt nod. “Sure, something like that.”

“I don’t know what ‘one card pull’ means,” I admitted. I noticed that Alexia, sleepy in my arms, had her head on my shoulder and was staring up at my eyes.

“Well,” Harriet continued. “There are what’s called ‘spreads’. There are all kinds of different ones. Some of them involve lots and lots of cards, and others involve only a few cards, or only one card.”

“Why does it vary like that?” I asked, becoming genuinely interested as I stared into Harriet’s sorrowful eyes across the fire.

“People use different spreads for different reasons. Like to answer a question, or a bunch of questions. To find out things about a person or yourself, even to predict the future… Like you said. So, basically, each card in a reading tells you something you want to know.”

“How do the cards know what I want to know?” I asked.

Harriet gave another one of those smiles that looked more devious than friendly. “You ask them.”

A chill shot up my spine so abruptly that I jerked. It sort of snapped Alexia out of her reverie and she moved to get off my lap, to allow me to go to Harriet for this “one card pull.”

“What are you going to ask them?” she asked me quietly, tracing a finger down my cheek.

I thought about it for a ridiculously long time, really coming up with nothing. Nothing I’d feel comfortable asking in front of everybody. Even Brad and Aiden had their attention captured by this interesting conversation and had joined us at the fire. For once in their lives they weren’t laughing or acting dumb. They were just as interested as everyone else.

Finally I stood up and moved over to sit down next to Harriet. “I dunno, one card, huh? Maybe can we ask for just a general indication of what’s in store for me next?” I asked.

That time I got a good smile out of her, she seemed ready to take me seriously. “Yeah, that’s a great intention for a one card pull! I actually do those all the time for myself.” She closed her eyes and clutched the deck to her chest for a few seconds. When she opened her eyes, she began to shuffle them again. “So, what I’m going to do is shuffle them three times, while focusing on what you want to know. Then, I will let you hold them for a minute so the cards can absorb your energy. Then I will take them back and allow you to draw whichever card calls to you.”

I was so drawn into the whole thing by then, I didn’t even stop to think how that all sounded like woo woo nonsense. Normally I would never have expected a deck of cards to call to me, nor would I believe they could answer any of my questions or foresee my future.

But, on the beautiful full moon evening of Beltane, everything magical seemed real.

As promised, she handed the cards to me after her third shuffle. I could practically feel my fingertips tingle as I took them into my hands. As Harriet had done, I too closed my eyes and held the cards to my chest. I expected to hear Brad and Aiden crack up laughing but they remained silent. Everything was quiet then, even the birdsong had died down and had been replaced by the sound of one lone screech owl somewhere nearby.

I pictured myself and Alexia. Looking a little older. Walking on an ambiguous imaginary college campus together. I thought of our future. I found that I really and truly wanted the tarot cards to tell me what was coming.

I opened my eyes and handed them back to Harriet. She handled them delicately as if they were an infant and she was their mother. She began to fan out the cards and even though she was explicitly careful with them, one card fell out of the deck and fluttered to the ground.

The coven laughed quietly. Vesper whispered, “wooooow.”

“What?” Brad asked. “What’s that mean?”

I finally glanced back at my friends who were standing behind me. They looked more engaged in this situation than I’d *ever* known them to be in any school lessons.

Harriet bent forward to pick up the card, which she kept face down as she brought it back up to her lap. She set the rest of the deck aside. “Not every reader does it the same, but to me, if a card pops out of the deck, then *that’s* your card. It’s literally the universe throwing your answer at you.”

“Cool,” Aiden murmured. These guys. I almost felt like I should be making fun of them. But, I was just as fascinated. “So what is it?” he demanded.

Harriet looked me in the eye in her unsettling way once again. “Are you ready?” she said.

I nodded enthusiastically. “Of course!”

Harriet turned the card over. Then she immediately jerked her hand and dropped the card.

The whole group squirmed to see what it was, as it landed face up this time. It had a gruesomely illustrated scene of a horned demon and it said, “The Devil.”

“Dang, man,” Carter muttered softly.

I looked around at each member of the coven. Harriet especially, looked very alarmed.

“What?” I asked. “What?! What’s it mean?”

My question snapped her out of it and she leaned forward again and snatched up the card. “It’s no big deal, I just was caught off guard because I’ve never had The Devil fall in a reading before.”

Never? She said this as though she were some decrepit old crone who’d been administering the tarot for decades, when in fact her knowledge probably didn’t span further back than a few months. “OK, so what does it mean?” I asked. Maybe it was a coping mechanism, but I’d kind of reverted to not believing this woo woo nonsense, but I was still curious to see how this works exactly.

“One thing it can mean is that your shadow self may come forward. A… Darker version of you,” Harriet said, this time avoiding looking me in the eye. And typically it sort of means that that shadow side of you will draw dark forces that sort of… Imprison you. It’s sort of like a warning… Be careful. You could hurt yourself forever…”

Everyone stared at Harriet. The breeze had stopped, it seemed like no one was even breathing, and even the owl had fallen silent. The tense moment seemed to span on for ages.

And then, Brad and Aiden burst into uproarious laughter.

I was actually happy for once that they did something dumb because it sort of broke the ice. The whole yard had slipped into some weird sort of glitch for a second, and it was uncomfortable. Not another word was said. Brad and Aiden returned to tossing the ball and everyone else returned to enjoying the fire. Carter played some more, and Alexia took up her dancing again. Despite the vastly differing personalities gathered there together, we settled into a fun, comfortable rhythm.

It was close to midnight when I realized both Brad and Aiden had been gone for a while. I’d vaguely noticed Aiden go in at some point, probably to use the bathroom, and then eventually Brad, and then they just… Never came back. It was getting cold so I figured maybe they were just tired of being outside. But I also knew it wouldn’t be above them to eat every single thing they could find in Alexia’s kitchen, so I quietly slipped away from the coven and went in to babysit the idiots.

As suspected, I did find them in the kitchen. They were eating Twinkies and drinking Pepsi while leaning against the counter discussing something asinine, I don’t even recall what. “Oh, hey man,” Brad said when I walked in.

I was about to launch into them for helping themselves to the food, but then Aiden chimed in. “What’s that crap?” he asked, pointing toward a corner of the kitchen counters. I stepped forward to see what he was pointing at.

It was a plastic water bottle, but inside, the water had sort of a pink tint, and there were weird flecks floating in it and a rock in the bottom. Weirdly, I actually knew what it was. Sort of.

“It’s moonwater,” I said, as if that should be a sufficient explanation.

They laughed. “Dude, what?” Brad said.

Alexia had been working on this moon water for a long time and had explained it to me. From what I had gathered, you place water out under the light of a full moon and it soaks up all that full moon magic. You can save it and let it set out for several full moons. You can put stuff in it to enhance its power. I think Alexia had told me hers had Rose Hips, Lavender, and a Rose Quartz stone in it? Maybe? Who knows. Some kind of witchy flowers and witchy rocks. Then, once you had this supposedly magically charged water you could use it for all sorts of magical purposes in your spell work.

Suddenly, staring at the weird pink water, and trying to explain this to Brad and Aiden, I began to feel slightly embarrassed. All the magical feelings of the evening seemed to be wearing off and I was coming back to my senses as a normal 17 year old male. Brad and Aiden were cracking up at me. My cheeks were turning red and I hated myself for it.

Aiden reached for the bottle and slid it toward me. “Drink it, magic boy.”

My heart began to pound. Mainly because I knew this was special to Alexia. But I had suddenly become deeply concerned about the fallout I might experience at school Monday over how interested I’d been in the inner workings of the coven tonight. I looked out toward the doorway and listened to see if anyone was coming.

Maybe she wouldn’t know.

Surely I could blame one of these morons.

I looked at the bottle again. Despite the feminine pink color, it looked really gross. But I knew there wasn’t anything in there that could hurt me unless I accidentally swallowed the rock.

Brad and Aiden were leering at me. It might have been my imagination, but suddenly they looked menacing. Like I *had* to do this.

I grabbed it and yanked off the cap, tipping it up and gulping it down fast to try not to feel the chunks.

“OH MY GOD DON’T DRINK THAT!”

I choked at the sound of Harriet’s scream and spewed the disgusting crusty water everywhere. Unfortunately, her demand was too late, I’d almost killed the whole bottle.

Harriet’s yell brought the rest of the coven inside, Alexia included.

“Bro,” Carter remarked. “You drank that? Gross.”

Alexia moved to the head of her friend group and gave me an inquisitive look with something else in her eyes… Hurt. “Blake?” she asked. “Did you drink that?”

It was in my hand, cap off, and water spewed down the front of my shirt, so there wasn’t really any way to deny it. I was mortified.

After a long tense few seconds, she laughed and ruffled my hair. “Weirdo,” she said, good naturedly.

“Hope you don’t get sick,” Minsy added.

“That’s the least of your worries,” Harriet muttered quietly.

The group soon moved on from my mishap, thankfully, and I did not get sick. We all continued to hang out, eat, Harriet pulled some more tarot cards for others in the group. One by one, our group wandered off to various points in the house to go to sleep. By 4 am, all of us were asleep. It was my first time spending the night with Alexia but by the time we finally went to bed, we were so exhausted that I didn’t even get a chance to be nervous. We quickly fell asleep wrapped in each others’ arms.

I snapped awake after a horrible nightmare. The dream had been like I was watching a horror movie starring myself, as in, I watched it all happen. I saw myself step out the back door into Alexia’s yard. Although now, the fire was out, the twinkling lights were off, and the only light was from that pale full moon which now had a sinister glow spilling down.

Seconds later, Brad and Aiden stepped out into the yard behind me. Unlike myself, who strode with purpose, they looked sluggish like sleep walkers. Sleepwalkers in a dream, so strange… I walked to the pool and then turned toward them. I gave a wide cordial smile. Strangely wide, and my teeth looked weirdly sharp as they glinted in the moonlight. I held up one hand toward my friends and then beckoned them with one crooked wiggling finger.

My two friends drifted across the yard like ghosts and joined me at the side of the pool. After a few awkward seconds of me standing there smiling at them, I untied the pool cover and pulled it back a little bit. Smiling again, like a gameshow host, I beckoned toward them in such a way as to invite them into the pool.

The POV shifted slightly to where the omniscient me, the one watching the scene, could see above. The pool water was dark green and slimy. I couldn’t believe my dream eyes when Brad and Aiden scrambled over the edge of the pool’s side and got into the water. This was dumb, even for them.

Then, I placed my hands on top of each of their heads, and pushed them down into the scummy water.

I looked on in horror while I held my friends down. They barely moved in their strange catatonic state and soon they were drifting face down on the water’s surface. I let them go and they remained face down in the murky water.

Still smiling the wide monstrous smile, I replaced the pool cover and tied it back into place. Then, I woke up.

I sat bolt upright in Alexia’s bed, drenched in sweat. It took me a minute to get my bearings, remember that the horrible scene was only a nightmare, and begin to slow my heartbeat down. But, I still felt compelled to actually set eyes on Brad and Aiden. Just to feel better.

I quietly slipped out of bed and left the room. I noted by a clock on the wall that it was seven am and sun was streaming in the window. It looked like it would be another gorgeous day. The nightmare had left me in the mood to spend it goofing off with my buddies.

I made my way down to the den where the two of them and Carter had claimed spots on the couches and in the recliner the night before. I distinctly remembered seeing all three of them settled down into their spots before I’d gone up to bed.

But, when I got to the den, I found only Carter, sound asleep in the same spot we originally saw him scrolling on his phone when we arrived.

Brad and Aiden were gone.

I began to get anxious again, as memory of the nightmare still stuck with me. But, logically, I assumed my friends had just bailed. They probably didn’t have permission to be out all night or something.

Within an hour, everyone was up and getting ready to vacate since Alexia’s dad would be home soon. We helped clean up and I asked the entire coven if anybody knew where Brad and Aiden went. Nobody had seen them leave, but, we still didn’t feel alarmed about the situation. I didn’t tell anybody about my horrible dream.

When I did start to feel alarmed was around noon. That’s when I got the first call from Aiden’s mom asking if I’d seen him. Brad’s mom called soon after.

Normally, I would know their whereabouts and cover for them if this happened. But, in this case, I was completely freaked out to hear from their moms and I came clean instantly. I confessed that we’d all spent the night at a girl’s house, and turned over contact information for Alexia and her father. Needless to say, I was really worried. My phone started blowing up shortly after with our other friends calling and texting me with their own questions about Brad and Aiden’s whereabouts. Nobody had seen or heard from them.

By school on Monday, they were being treated as official missing persons. Their phones were pinged by the phone company and revealed that the phones were off and therefore it was not helpful. Our entire town was mystified. For that week of school, the mood became more and more gloomy and depressed with each day our friends were missing. Even Alexia and the coven were upset. After all, the magic of Beltane had brought them together with Brad and Aiden.

Things took a very unfortunate turn that following weekend when Alexia’s dad decided to open the pool for the season.

I wasn’t there, but she had been helping him with the task. I’m told that father and daughter both came unglued when the bloated, molding, decomposing bodies of her classmates were discovered floating face down in the pool.

Obviously, our town erupted into the chaos that horrible tragedy invites.

On top of the grief we all felt, pretty much every parent freaked out, assuming there was a kid killer on the loose. I, of course, was terrified for another reason.

Not only was I stricken with extraordinary pain over the loss of two friends I’d had since kindergarten, I was consumed with thoughts of the dream I had. The memory of the nightmare had never left me. It remained as vivid as it had been the night I had it. It remained so vivid, it was like still being in it.

But, due to the alarm and the extenuating circumstances, the police didn’t waste any time with their investigation. There were motion activated security cameras all around Alexia’s house. All the footage was saved to online storage. Unlike the olden days of security films where footage was lost, damaged, or turned off at all the wrong times, Mr. Andrews turned the footage over to the police immediately. It only took a short time for them to see the entire horrific event take place.

I never saw the footage. But everyone in town talked about it. People still talk about it. Shortly after 4, after everyone in the house would’ve gone to bed, Brad and Aiden are seen coming out the back door. Apparently they looked dazed or ghostly. They walked slowly and stumbled. Because of this, the rumor was that they must have been messed up on something. Of course, toxicology was later done and concluded they were both drug and alcohol free, but our community couldn’t seem to believe they would do something like this on their own free will.

And, as much as my heart and soul hates to admit it, they didn't.

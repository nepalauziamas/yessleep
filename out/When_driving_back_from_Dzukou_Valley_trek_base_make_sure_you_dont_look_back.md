 

Dzukou Valley was more beautiful than the pictures you can find online. It was a great trek but we were now pretty exhausted after walking back 4 hours. It was almost sunset when we reached the base and were finally relieved to see our Car. No more walking, we had to just drive out from the forest and go back to our hotel in Kohima city. 

Our guide seemed a bit pissed off since we spent a bit too much time at the top, then we couldn’t keep up the pace coming down and as a result it was almost dark. We were warned that we needed to be out of the forest before it got dark, but we had barely made it to our car now and it was still a 30 - 40 mins winding down from the hilly forest to reach the main road. In some places the roads were so bad that you couldn't go faster than 15 km/hr.

As we sat in the car our guide who was about 50 years old said something to our friend Naro in their native language. Naro was the one driving and the guide sat next to him, while Jason, Rajat and I sat behind. We 4 were friends through work. Kohima was Naro’s hometown and we had come here to spend a long weekend primarily for this trek. It seemed the guide was asking Naro to tell us something, but Naro was reluctant to do so. 

I was too tired to be interested in it, but Jason was the curious one. When he insisted, finally Naro told us about the local myth that the guide wanted us to know. He explained that according to locals, whenever a car passes through these roads at night, something latches onto the car from behind. Almost everyone who has driven here at night felt something holding onto the car from behind. Apparently there is no one alive who has seen it, anyone who has dared to look back has met with a tragic car accident. 

For us it was just another local myth that we didn’t care about, Jason tried to make a joke about it which agitated the guide. He turned around and said to us in his broken English “This is no funny, you look back, we die”. 

The sun was gone now and it was clear we were not making it out of the forest before dark. The guide took out his handkerchief and tied it around the back view mirror to cover it. He told something to Naro who then closed the side view mirror as well.

While Jason was the curious one, and Rajat was a Hyper-Rational one. Myth was fine, but acting on them was something that Rajat would not accept. “What are you guys doing, seriously?” Rajat asked the front seaters.

Naro didn’t want to argue, “We would reach the main road in 10-15 mins, just play along.”

We knew Rajat wouldn’t play along, “Guys we are educated folks, we cannot follow these false beliefs blindly like idiots” 

“It is true, every villager has felt, many died in accidents” the guide scoffed.

Rajat continued to mock Naro, “So Naro, blocking your rearview and side view mirrors reduces chances of an accident or increases it?”.

Jason too interrupted asking Rajat to just chill and let it go, but Rajat continued his debate with the guide and Naro, explaining how if everyone died, who told them that they turned around and saw that thing?

I wondered how could these guys even bother to debate about this being so tired after the trek.

I soon phased out from the debate, that’s when I felt it. I don’t know if it was the change in moon light that entered the car or whether I saw a shadow from the corner of my eye. But I knew there was something behind. 

“Guys, don’t look behind. But I think there is someone hanging onto our car from behind.”

Everyone freaked out, Jason too felt it. “Shit, shit, shit, let’s get out of this place. How far is the main road now?”

Rajat still wanted to play rationale, “It may be just some villager, taking a free ride to the Main Road. We were so slow, anyone could have hopped and grabbed on to”. We were driving a JEEP, the one which has a spare tire behind. It had bars on back that anyone could actually grab onto.

Meanwhile the guide just kept saying, ”Don’t look at it”

I realized this freaked out Naro, he did look at the rear view mirror with all the commotion happening behind, fortunately, or unfortunately they were covered.

“Just 5 mins and we will be out of here” Naro tried to calm us down.

Rajat was quiet for a while, I sensed that he wanted to challenge the myth. All he had to do was look behind and he could be proven right about what he had been debating since the last 10 mins. He was 99% sure that nothing would happen, it would either be a local villager or maybe a monkey or simply nothing but our fears manifesting. But he too had the 1% fear of the unknown.

Me and Jason sat with our heads down, making sure we didn't even catch a glimpse of it by mistake. Rajat tried to be a bit brave and sat up straight staring towards the guide, who had his eyes closed muttering something in native tongue, probably praying. Naro tried to focus on driving us out of here as quickly as possible. 

I realized how the fear has made Naro drive faster and recklessly, could this be the reason for the accidents?

Naro asked us to be calm, “We are almost there, just 2-3 more turns and we will reach the main road. I hope whatever it is will leave us when we reach there”

We could almost see the lights on the main road. This was also the last chance for Rajat to prove the myth as false, I saw him tap his leg nervously thinking over it. I knew it was tempting for him, but I didn’t expect Rajat to actually turn around. 

Suddenly we heard multiple knocks on the back mirror, and I saw Rajat had turned to look back.

I still don’t know if it was a reflex to the knock or Rajat trying to prove his point. In fact I don’t know what happened first, the knock or Rajat turning around.

The knock made everyone almost jump on their seats, our heart hammered in our chest. 

I could only scream, “Rajat Nooo”. This made the guide look behind and he had a look of instant regret as he turned. All this panic made Naro hit the pedal to accelerate, a bit too fast for that particular turn.   
We soon felt that our car was tilting towards the right, sliding down. The next second we were upside down, banging our heads against the car roof and each other. Bodies flying and a lot of screaming was the last thing I remembered.

I woke up later in the hospital to learn that I was the only survivor from the crash. I wondered whom to blame, Naro for panicking, the guide for scaring us, Rajat for looking back or that thing that was holding onto our car.   
The only ones who probably saw that thing were Rajat and the guide, then why did Jason and Naro die? Did they see it too when the car somersaulted? On our crash site, they also found an unidentified body.

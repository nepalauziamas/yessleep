That’s what my parents always said. “Shhh” they would whisper. “Don’t talk about it, don’t acknowledge it”

I would get into bed and pull the covers tight. My bedroom illuminated with the light from the tv and the faint sound of some sitcom. Usually George Lopez or Friends. Something about those 2 shows seemed to help. The show really didn’t matter though just the noise did. Not to loud but loud enough. 

Nights would pass and nothing would happen. I could breathe a sigh of relief at least until the next night. The first time was scary but I laid still and didn’t move. I waited for it to pass. It felt like hours had gone by. I took a deep breath and sat up quickly. My room was empty just the tv was blaring. How did it get so loud? That’s not normal. I turned it down and convinced myself not to think about it. Remember what mom and dad said. Don’t acknowledge it. 

I never knew what “it” was. I just knew it wasn’t anything I wanted a part of. My dad said it was generational. My mom said it was superstitions. How does that even make sense? How do you not talk about something or acknowledge what’s happening? 

Some things made it worse or mad. Not really sure that it felt emotions. I just knew I needed to break its grip on me. 

A bible by my bed and a cross close to my heart. I would be protected and I would make it stop. I prayed that the last time was the last time.. it never was.

Tonight was a normal night, I came home from work, washed up and got ready to lay down. I flipped through channels looking for a show that didn’t have to many “dark” scenes. Yes! George Lopez was on. I turned down the volume to 5 just like every night. I got comfortable, feeling safe I drifted off to sleep. 

I felt a tug at my leg. Adjust my feet, tug tug. Move the blanket I must be wrapped in it, tug tug. My heavy blanket flew across the room. I suddenly turned from my side to my back. Pressure on my chest building, it got harder to breathe. I was awake, I think. I tried to lift my arms but they felt like they weighed a thousand pounds.  Almost as if I was paralyzed. I tried to scream but no sound came out. 

Help!
Help please!
Nothing but silence

My eyes were open but I couldn’t see. it was pitch black. What happened to the light from my tv?

What just touched my leg? 

“yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I shall fear no ev….” 

Finger nails traced up the side of leg, a light scratch that got heavier and harder. I can feel my skin separating, the nails moved higher on to my thigh. 

I can’t breathe… 

THUMP
THUMP
THUMP

I jumped up, whatever startled me startled it too. It broke its control only for a second. I made it to the corner of my bed crying I screamed.

Slowly large imprints of hands, feet? What are those? claws? 

Closer and closer 

Cold breath on my cheek. I attempt to scream. My voice is gone again…

Ring Ring Ring

“Why you cryin” I hear faintly from my tv. The light from it now illuminating my room. 

Ring Ring Ring

I try to orientate myself. Still not sure if I am awake. Something warm and wet is flooding down my leg. Afraid to look I take off my T-shirt and cover my leg with it. Everything’s fine I keep telling myself. 

Ring Ring Ring

I slowly reach for my phone and hit accept. A warm voice on the other end. “Are you ok” I didn’t respond. Trying not to cry I held my breath. “I’ll be right there! Stay on the phone with me ok?!” 

No, no, no he can’t come see me like this. How am I supposed to explain what just happened. He will think I’m crazy for sure. Before I could even finish my thought footsteps echoed down the hall leading to my bedroom. The door flung open and there he stood. Strong and tall with his shaggy brown hair. He rushed to my side, eyes wide open with concern. I flinched at his touch. His soft words shaken..

“Are you ok?” 

It was Luke. We’ve been a couple dates and although it’s early I think he might be the one.

I remained silent holding my tshirt to my thigh, I winced at the pain. He looked down at my leg. Blood was seeping through my T-shirt. Silently he motioned for me to move it so he could see. I shook my head no and mumbled “please don’t make me show you” 

He swept me up in his arms, for a moment I felt weightless as he lifted me up with ease. He didn’t even bother to lock door. I think he felt something, it, what it was. He gently placed me in the passenger seat of his truck. Rushing around to the driver seat he got in and immediately pulled away. 

“We have to go to the hospital” he whispered  

“We can’t.” 

He clenched the steering wheel, his knuckles white from his grip.

“I’ll tell you everything I promise. Just not right now and not at the hospital” 

We drove around in silence for awhile. Neither of us sure if we should speak. He handed me a water bottle, “please drink something”

I sipped on the water trying to regain my voice. “I think you saved me tonight and I’m not even sure from what. How did you know something was wrong?” He gently pushed the hair from my face and grabbed my chin. His voice obviously shaken “I had a dream that I was walking through a room, it was pitch black and made my stomach turn. I heard crying and tried to run towards the sound. As I got closer a shimmer of light was shining onto something… something dark, something not quite human. I slowed my pace and the crying got louder. I don’t think it knew I could see it but I slowly moved forward. I could see a body but it was blurry. I couldn’t turn away now so I kept moving forward. That’s when I seen your face. Your eyes sunken and mouth wide open. It almost looked as if you were suffocating maybe? I’m not really sure what I saw other then I saw you. I woke up and knew I needed to make sure you were ok. When I called I could hear the panic in your breaths. Please tell me that was all my imagination?”

“I can’t…”

He put his head into his hands “what is it?“

“I don’t know, I’ve only every heard stories but my parents always said not talk about it period. I think we should just forget this ever happened”

His voice raised “how can we forget this!? You are bleeding! You’re scared! I’m scared!”

“I know, take me to my parents house please”

We drove for what felt like hours but was only about 20 mins away. It was one in the morning but I unlocked the front door and went straight to their bedroom. My mom was sleeping soundly but my dad just didn’t look quite right. Same as my room a little noise from the tv and the light from it used as a night light.  I slowly moved towards them to not startle them awake. My dads chest sunken. I grabbed his shoulders to shake him awake but he felt cold. “dad! Dad!l my mom jumped up from her bed startled by my screams. His eyes open but his his stare empty. 

That’s when I heard it. A raspy, very low voice “one from every generation is all I need” 
I turned back to see Luke standing in the doorway frozen with fear.

The raspy voice continued “I can’t wait to feed on your offspring.  If your fear taste that good theirs will be even better” 

“Please let him go!” I shouted

The room went cold my mom and Luke frozen in place. That’s when I seen it. For the first time I was faced with my biggest fear. Maybe it used to be human and he or she was damned. I don’t really know what I was looking at. A dark figure moved closer to me, it’s arms too long for it’s body. It almost looked as if it was melting, like the skin was melting from its bones. It’s hand like a claw, long fingers with sharp ends. It ran its mail up my neck under my chin. 

“You didn’t listen. They told you not to acknowledge me. They warned you” it chuckled. 

“Please let them all go, I’ll do whatever you want ok” 

“You are all I want”

“Take me then! Just please let them go!” I cried. 

“So brave of you”

As quick as it came it was gone. There I was in my parents bedroom everyone frozen, the air silent. Suddenly the light from the tv shut off. I took a step forward and it felt like I dropped off a cliff. Falling and falling and falling. I didn’t even scream, I’ll accept this and finally be at peace. 

Or so I thought. 

I awoke on cold concrete, pitch black and deafening silence. I went to lift my hand but felt something dripping…. Drip, drip, drip, a sliver of light came from the corner of the room I placed my hand it’s path. I pulled back and screamed at what I saw. Skin melting from my bones. 

“Don’t worry my dear, now you’re mine forever” the familiar raspy voice said now oddly calming. “Just breathe, you’ll soon be just like me”

That’s what my parents always said. “Shhh” they would whisper. “Don’t talk about it, don’t acknowledge it”

I would get into bed and pull the covers tight. My bedroom illuminated with the light from the tv and the faint sound of some sitcom. Usually George Lopez or Friends. Something about those 2 shows seemed to help. The show really didn’t matter though just the noise did. Not to loud but loud enough. 

Nights would pass and nothing would happen. I could breathe a sigh of relief at least until the next night. The first time was scary but I laid still and didn’t move. I waited for it to pass. It felt like hours had gone by. I took a deep breath and sat up quickly. My room was empty just the tv was blaring. How did it get so loud? That’s not normal. I turned it down and convinced myself not to think about it. Remember what mom and dad said. Don’t acknowledge it. 

I never knew what “it” was. I just knew it wasn’t anything I wanted a part of. My dad said it was generational. My mom said it was superstitions. How does that even make sense? How do you not talk about something or acknowledge what’s happening? 

Some things made it worse or mad. Not really sure that it felt emotions. I just knew I needed to break its grip on me. 

A bible by my bed and a cross close to my heart. I would be protected and I would make it stop. I prayed that the last time was the last time.. it never was.

Tonight was a normal night, I came home from work, washed up and got ready to lay down. I flipped through channels looking for a show that didn’t have to many “dark” scenes. Yes! George Lopez was on. I turned down the volume to 5 just like every night. I got comfortable, feeling safe I drifted off to sleep. 

I felt a tug at my leg. Adjust my feet, tug tug. Move the blanket I must be wrapped in it, tug tug. My heavy blanket flew across the room. I suddenly turned from my side to my back. Pressure on my chest building, it got harder to breathe. I was awake, I think. I tried to lift my arms but they felt like they weighed a thousand pounds.  Almost as if I was paralyzed. I tried to scream but no sound came out. 

Help!
Help please!
Nothing but silence

My eyes were open but I couldn’t see. it was pitch black. What happened to the light from my tv?

What just touched my leg? 

“yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I shall fear no ev….” 

Finger nails traced up the side of leg, a light scratch that got heavier and harder. I can feel my skin separating, the nails moved higher on to my thigh. 

I can’t breathe… 

THUMP
THUMP
THUMP

I jumped up, whatever startled me startled it too. It broke its control only for a second. I made it to the corner of my bed crying I screamed.

Slowly large imprints of hands, feet? What are those? claws? 

Closer and closer 

Cold breath on my cheek. I attempt to scream. My voice is gone again…

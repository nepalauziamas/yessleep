I was awoken by a notification from Amazon saying “Your package has been cancelled.” I looked at the tracking map and it was in the middle of the forest. My brain was fried and it was late so I tried to fall back asleep, but failed. Right as I dozed off, I heard a bang in the distance. I woke up and ran out to my car. I had a hunch that they were connected.  
The forest in the map was about 20 minutes away, and once I got there, I got a weird feeling about being here. I pushed through, but oh, I wish i didn’t. 

When I walked in, I found huts. Hundreds of huts. I walked throughout, trying to walk quietly. But then, the worst happened. I stepped in a small stick, and it broke. Everyone in the huts came out and stared at me. Didn’t say anything, just stared. I felt weirdly drawn to the area. I felt like it was my home. On my Amazon app, it showed your driver’s picture. I found him, in a robe with some kind of machine on his head. I fought the urge and ran, but when I got into my car, it didn’t start. They were running towards me. I went black.

I woke up in a field. All those people were there, but they seemed like cheerful, normal people. The land was beautiful, and there was this one man who U felt drawn to, like he was my savior. Everyone looked at him in awe. He was pretty normal looking. There was a voice in my head, telling me to do the same. I did. I felt rejuvenated. It felt like I finally found my place. But then something told me otherwise. I then went black again. 

I woke up in one of those huts. All those people were there, bowing before that man. The voice was still there, but we were back in the night. I felt scared, nervous. But then, I found that machine on my head. I ran as far as I could, but they didn’t. But then, they basically teleported to my car. They had really wide smiles, wider than any human could. That man, he stood there. He told me that they were the community of saved people, people who were saved from the human virus. That voice came back louder, but I knew not to trust it. I ran as fast as I could, before a rope held by their leader pulled me back. He pulled me to a larger machine, it was a cover of the head above a seat. 

He put me in it and I was back in the field. It was really beautiful, and all my family was there, they told me to listen to the leader. I trusted them, and oh boy, how I should have never. 

I jumped in this hole, and I woke up, back in the night, feeling like that hut was my home. All of those community members, who were now controlling me, they cheered. They said a new human was saved. I felt great. I found “the Savior.” He looked at me and said, “A new child was found.” But then, I broke out. I thought of my family, my real family. That broke me out of this trance. I left my car there, and ran as fast as I can. So, if your Amazon driver is ever in the middle of the woods, don’t go there. Please, don’t go there.

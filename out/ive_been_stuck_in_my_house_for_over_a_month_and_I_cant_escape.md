This all started when i was chilling in my house, nothing going on, just the TV playing in the background while i was sleeping in the living room, on the couch. But then i heard a loud *BANG* and it woke me up. When i went to go check what happened no one was there. So i just passed it off as a house problem i'd fix in a few days. But then i had the sudden urge to use the bathroom so i got up and went to the entrance of the bathroom door, but when i opened it, it wasn't the bathroom at all... It was the living room with the couch and thr TV and everything! I was so confused... I thought it was just me seeing things because there was a party last night at my house and alot of people got really drunk, including me. But when i walked through the door it was just... The living room. No toilet or shower, just the couch and TV all right there. That just confused me even more. But then i heard that bang again. But this time it was louder. So, still very confused i went to go check what it was. Yet again it was nothing. The urge to use the bathroom got even worse. So i tried using the bathroom door again but, as expected it only showed the living room.

At this point i was getting pretty scared, because i had no clue what was going on. i figured it was still the beer i had but the more i kept trying to go into the bathroom the more i got worried bc it just kept showing the living room. So i tried to scream for help... But of course that didn't work. it only made my situation worse. so now i'm here, stuck in an endless void of seeing my couch and TV. but i refused to believe it... So i tried opening a different door but it still showed the same room. I was starting to get scared for my life. Bc i had no idea what to do. I mean how could you? So i kept opening the doors over and over again in hopes that this was just a terrifying dream. But no, none of it was... It was all somehow a reality. So i tried and tried over and over until i just gave up and accepted it. I am stuck here for eternity. Or at least until i die. But i still had to use the restroom and badly. So i did the only thing i thought of doing. I used a bottle and did my thing. I didn't enjoy it but it got the job done. Afterwards i sat down and tried to fall asleep, my brain so puzzled from what's happening. I slowly close my eyes and let the time pass by.


I'll skip all the nonsense from the past week when this started. Besides nothing interesting happened mainly just having to use the bathroom and trying to sparringly use my food. But after that week. I started hearing strange noises from my hallway. And when i went to check there was no one there.. i got so confused... And i felt a terrible presance when walking into the hallway. but it just disapeered. Like nothing happened. So i just ignored it and went back to sleep. Because what else could i do?? So i just tried to sleep all the time. Still refusing to believe i was stuck. Hoping to wake up from this terrible nightmare and well. Let's just say i shoulda stayed up.

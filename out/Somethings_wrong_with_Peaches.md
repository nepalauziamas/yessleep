Peaches has always been a particular bird, but recently I've noticed something strange. Peaches is overly intelligent, she can solve math problems and read, and sometimes it seems like she's smarter than me. None of this was a problem until about 2 months ago, when something happened that made me question just how special she was.

So, it was a Friday night I had just gotten off work and it had been a pretty good day overall. Then as I started to go to bed I heard a strange sound, Peaches was in the room saying a name that sounded very familiar to me. Mitchell was my uncle's name and at first, it seemed like nothing, so I ignored it and went to bed. This same thing happened every night at precisely 2:23 am, but with different names each time, my mom was named, my friends were named, along with many others. I chalked it up to Peaches just learning new words and went back to sleep. Nothing happened, so I never really worried until I found out what was happening.

About a month after the first incident occurred, I decided I was gonna go drink with Mitchell just like old times. Mitchell, Mom, and all my friends concluded to meet up at a little cabin in the woods. We owned the cabin for years and we always went there to throw parties and reunions. once I got there the door seemed to be boarded so I took the prybar out of my truck and forced my way in. I felt something dripping from the ceiling. It had that stench of iron like somebody had been bleeding.

"*Hmm*, *strange*", I thought

&#x200B;

I heard no voices, no conversation.

&#x200B;

"*Mitchell*, *are yall here!"* I yelled

&#x200B;

All I could hear was the steady rain outside. I walked into the living room and immediately saw the lifeless bodies of my friends on the floor. I franticly searched around the house looking for the others. I found my mom in the bathroom, laying on her stomach with a huge slit across her wrist. Mitchell was upstairs, he had blown his head off with the 16 gauge shotgun I had gotten him a year prior. That dripping that was coming from the ceiling was his blood mixed with brain matter. My friends, Eric and Kevin, were laying on their backs. They were both missing their legs. I ran outside and called the police, once they showed up I made my report and went home.

Now, just a month later, I was in the pet store where I sold Peaches. I was getting a puppy for my nephew for her 7th birthday, and that's when I heard it.

&#x200B;

"Jake" the bird murmured in his robotic voice.

my heart felt like it was gonna jump out of my chest, I walked outside and saw the cars driving down the highway. I made my way to my car and I unlocked the doors. I sat down and my heart rate just got faster. I felt a sharp pain in my chest and tried screaming for help, but nobody could hear me. I pulled the 44. out of my glovebox and prayed it would end my suffering.

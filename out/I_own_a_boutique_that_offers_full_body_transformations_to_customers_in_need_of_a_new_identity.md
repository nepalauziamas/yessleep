A quick introduction – I’m Fran Hart, of Fran Hart’s Fabulous Frocks and Happy Haberdashery. It’s a bit of a mouthful, but a unique shop requires a unique name to match, and my humble establishment is truly one of a kind. You wouldn’t think so if you were to wander in here, try on some dresses, maybe pick through some cufflinks. An appearance of normality is essential to maintaining the safety of both my business and my customers, and the revenues from my hand-sewn apparel in the front room keeps the shop afloat, puts food in my mouth.

As I’m sure you all understand, things as they appear and things as they truly *are* are rarely one and the same. And while I adore sewing dresses and curating my collection of handsome accessories, my true passion lies within another craft entirely. In fact, this entire business serves as a front so that I may deliver this craft discretely. When you peddle a service as unique as I do, anonymity is key – you didn’t think I gave my real name, did you?

I’m content to run the front end of the house, but I truly live for the moments when I am called on to utilize my true expertise – this other craft is far more challenging, and equally as fulfilling. When a shopper steps through the door, triggering the tinny ring of its attached bell, I’ll treat them as normal until they utter the predetermined code phrase. At that point, my heart will leap as I set to work to satisfy their request.

For these select customers, I provide full body makeovers… and I do mean *full body* in the most literal sense possible. My clients walk in as themselves and walk out an entirely different person. We all want to get out of our own skin sometimes, to try something new. Is there really something so wrong with a little change every so often? I have a back stock of hundreds of deflated… *skinsuits*, for lack of a better word, left behind by my past customers in favor of an entirely new appearance.

Folks come to me for a variety of reasons, but very rarely are they positive ones. I don’t try to judge – if I did, I’d very likely see a dramatic decrease in business – but the exact location of my storefront is usually sought by people in moments of intense desperation, of fear, of a need to escape who or *what* they are. Most are surprised to find that their friendly neighbor Fran Hart is the one they’ve been searching for all along, that the service they so urgently need is located at the unassuming boutique down the street.

This was not true of the gal I served this afternoon, though – in fact, I’d never seen her before. She’d probably come from out of town. It wouldn’t shock me if word of my business was beginning to spread even farther past the locale in which I reside – I actually had another client from out of town a few days ago.

She was a pretty little thing, with a slender frame and bright blonde hair that was either natural or cost a pretty penny to make it look as such. She wandered up to my counter where I was seated, flipping through a catalogue of fabrics and circling patterns for future orders. “Hi, are you… are you Fran Hart?” she asked cautiously, blue eyes shifting from side to side.

“The one and only,” I replied, rising from my seat to tower over her – I’ve always been tall. “You looking for a dress, love? I’ve just put out a gorgeous new style, it’s got a sweetheart neckline that’ll just make your -”

The young woman shook her head furiously. “No, Fran… I know you’re selling more than dresses.”

Blinking rapidly, I chose to play dumb – I do it so well that I could’ve had a promising career in acting, if fate hadn’t brought me to oversee the boutique. “I’m sorry, miss… I don’t quite understand what you’re getting at…?”

“Oh, shit,” she muttered, rolling her eyes at her own error. “Uhm, I’d like to see what you have in the back. I’m interested in a… custom fitting.”

My code phrase – just as inconspicuous as the store itself. Without a word, I paced to the front door and locked it, flipping the hanging sign from “We’re open, haber-*dash* on in!” to “Ah, frock! We’re closed!”.  I signaled for the woman to follow me with a wave as I drew back a black curtain on the wall behind the register. We both ducked through the threshold into the back room, a large stockroom dotted with mannequins, both dressed and bare. A large table stood in its center, a pair of chairs tucked around one corner.

I gestured to one chair as I sat in the other to face her.

A confused look crossed the woman’s face. “Where… where are they? Don’t I get to look around?”

“Not quite,” I answered, pointing to the chair opposite of me. I waited for her to take her seat before continuing, “this isn’t any kind of shopping experience you’ll be used to, but the system is simple, and I’d like to keep it that way. There will be no perusing of the proverbial shopping racks, no trying on. You tell me what you want – what kind of change you’re looking for – and *why*, and I’ll use this information to give you the change you need.”

“Uhm, okay,” she conceded, though I could sense some discomfort. “How much is this going to cost me?”

“Nothing more than you’re already willing to give up,” I sighed, picking up the legal pad I’d left on the table and clicking my pen open. “You forfeit your old look once I’ve put you in a new one. From there, I will use it as I see fit. Might put it on someone else, might destroy it. It all depends.”

Nodding slowly, she seemed engaged in an internal debate, weighing if the terms were worth the value of my craft. They all do, and they all always say,

“Okay, let’s do it.”

Smiling warmly, I exclaimed, “great! Go ahead and start us off with why you need such a drastic change.”

“Well, uhm,” she started meekly, crossing her arms tightly over her chest. “I just got out of a bad marriage.”

As I scribbled down the note, I interjected, “good on you, finally getting up the courage to put yourself first.”

She laughed softly before replying, “well, when he went to prison, it made it a lot easier to cut ties.”

“Oh?” I pressed, lifting an eyebrow.

“He’s away serving several life sentences for a couple murders and a whole slew of other charges,” she elaborated, sighing. “There were, uhm, quite a few victims overall… ten or so. When I met him, he was just… the kindest man I’d ever encountered, a real gentleman. As time went on, though, he changed… or maybe I just saw him for who he really was. He quickly became controlling, he’d put me down, hit me sometimes…

“I only saw how much of a monster he truly was when I came home early from visiting family one evening and he had… he had a girl tied up in the bedroom. I- I didn’t know what to do, I just panicked and froze,” she explained, closing her eyes for a long moment. “My husband was very manipulative, managed to calm me down and dissuaded me from telling anyone. I don’t really know what ever happened to her.”

Exhaling loudly, I asked, “but there were more after that?”

The young woman nodded, responding, “he told me there was an ugliness within him that he needed to get out, that he’d be a better husband to me if I just let him be. And… he really was better to me after that night, didn’t hit me, was the same guy I fell in love with. I had access to some pretty strong prescription drugs at my place of work, and he convinced me to snatch some for him, saying that… if he gave it to the girls, they wouldn’t even remember what had happened to them at all.”

“So, you did?”

“Yeah, I did,” she admitted, somehow appearing even smaller as she spoke. “I knew it was wrong, but I was *so* scared of him… I did it anyway. He was so much kinder to me that it all felt... okay, in a strange way. This went on for a couple years, but I’d always leave after giving him the meds. I only found out that he’d escalated to murder when I caught him stuffing a large duffel bag into the bed of his truck… it was the body of one of his victims.”

Tears fell from her bright eyes as she continued, “the authorities caught up to him soon after that… I avoided charges with my testimony and because I helped locate some videos as evidence, but I’ve become absolutely hated in my community. I will never be able to continue my life looking this way, but more than that I fear my husband will track me down and find me if he ever manages to get out on an appeal.”

She wept silently for a few minutes before pulling a crumpled tissue from her bag and blowing her nose. I finished jotting down notes, though I already knew exactly what to do with her.

“I know just the thing for you, miss,” I declared, standing up to gather my supplies – plastic sheeting, a vial of chartreuse liquid, a pair of fabric shears, a large needle and a spool of thick thread. Spreading the plastic covering over the table, I motioned for her to get on the surface. “Oh, and drink this,” I added, handing her the small container of fluid.

Shrugging, she tipped her head back, emptying the bright green liquid into her throat all at once. She was out soon after that, and I began my work – first cutting down the length of her torso, branching out to her limbs, her hands, her feet, and lastly, her face. My instruments are unlike any others – these particular fabric shears glide through flesh cleanly, with little blood lost. I stripped the skin from her body, starting with the larger portions and then to degloving individual fingers, toes.

With the woman reduced to a blank canvas, I made my way to the locked closet space lining the back wall, using the key to reveal a substantial collection of “looks” – really just a series of emptied flesh, preserved by some unknown force. Thumbing through the selection, I located the look I’d chosen and peeled it from its hanger before throwing it over one arm to carry it back to the table. Getting the skin spread out evenly underneath is the hardest part, but once that’s out the way, the transformation is completed soon after.

Moving from the extremities inward, I sewed the look shut around the young woman, piercing the skin and drawing the thick twine through to create tight stitches. Much like my scissors, these items possess unique properties. The spool is never ending, and its thread dissolves into the skin as I work, binding the flesh together seamlessly. I wish I could say where these supplies came from, but I’m not the original owner of this here shop – I was once just a customer myself.

The young woman began to stir about twenty minutes after my work was finished. I like to do a dramatic reveal – like in those makeover shows on TV – so I’d fixed a blindfold over her eyes.

“Don’t worry, miss,” I reassured, bending forward to take her hand in mine. “Let me help you up to the mirror.”

With some effort, she sat up and stepped off the table, following my lead to an ornate standing mirror in the corner of the room. Loosening the blindfold, I let it fall to the floor as she took in her new appearance.

“What the hell… what is this?” she cried, eyes widening in disbelief as she stepped closer to her reflection. I’d dressed her in a recently acquired look, one that I got from a scrawny gal with short cropped mousy brown hair, an abundance of scars, and a permanent look of exhaustion.

“This is the new you,” I answered, though this did nothing to soothe the young woman. “I got this look from one of my more recent customers, she came to me because she felt nothing but pain when she looked in the mirror, though she could never figure out why. She chopped her hair off, dragged razors across every inch of her body, starved herself half to death… but still, she never knew the true source of the agony she felt inside.

“Until a few months ago, when a police officer informed her that she’d been identified as one of the victims of a predator they’d recently caught – he’d kept tapes of what he’d done to these girls, all of them drugged out of their minds,” I explained, breathing a heavy sigh. “When you came here, started sharing what your husband had done… it didn’t take long for me to put two and two together – she was one of his victims.”

Her lower lip quivered as she stuttered, “but I… I didn’t do anything to her.”

A brief laugh escaped through my nose. “I know, dear, but that’s its own problem. You did nothing to stop him, provided the tools for him to continue, and she lived with all of this pain in part because of *you*.” Softening my tone, I continued, “I believe that your fear of him kept you from saying anything. Still, I can’t let you leave my shop without being sure that you won’t allow something like this to happen every again.

“The pain that you feel in your body is the pain that she felt for so many years – her pain now belongs to you,” I explained, sweeping my hand over the plethora of raised pink scars covering the new flesh that coated her arm. “This pain will serve as a daily reminder to do something, to say something the next time – god forbid there *is* a next time you must stop something like this from happening.”

Through tears, she nodded in silent acceptance before gathering her things. I guided her back to the front of the store and watched to make sure she got to her car safely. It was far past the usual closing time, so I turned the latch to relock the door as soon as her car pulled off the street, snatching the half empty bottle of bourbon from beneath the counter to pour myself a few fingers of the liquor. Sometimes I need assistance to unwind after a long day of work, and getting my rest is crucial. Tomorrow is another day, and another day means more customers.

I understand many of you will feel I let her off easy, but I believed her. I try to see the good in people, even in such dark situations. And for those of you who think I was too harsh in determining her new look, she knew exactly what she was getting into – the risks were fully disclosed. I tell her – and each customer seeking a custom fitting – that here at Fran Hart’s Fabulous Frocks and Happy Haberdashery, you won’t always get what you *want*.

But I *always* make sure my customers get [what they need](https://www.reddit.com/r/hercreation/).

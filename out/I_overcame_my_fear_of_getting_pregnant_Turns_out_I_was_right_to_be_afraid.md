I still remember the day I first became scared of getting pregnant.

I was six. Mom and I were at the mall and ran across Mom’s friend Susan. They chatted while I played at the fountain nearby. Just as I began to grow bored, Mom scooped me up, and we headed for the exit.

“Susan’s gotten a little fat since I saw her last time,” I remarked, oblivious at the time of how rude the comment was.

Mom stopped and shot me a look of angered bewilderment, and for a moment. I thought I was in trouble. Then her expression softened.

“You’re going to learn something fun today,” she said. She called to Susan, who came back over and asked what was up. Mom smiled. “Lucy’s curious about the baby.”

Baby? The word didn’t make sense in the context. I knew babies were those little blobs of noise that were always around, and that I had supposedly been one not long before. There weren’t any around at the moment. Did Susan have a baby at home? Even if she did, I didn’t understand how that had anything to do with her bloated waistline.

Susan’s face lit up, and she walked over to me. “Well, Lucy,” she said. “What is it you’d like to know?”

“What baby are you talking about?” I asked.

Susan patted her stomach. “The one in here, of course!”

*My* stomach did a flip at that, and a profound sense of queasiness overcame me. I thought of an image I’d seen when I was five, an image I’d not been meant to see and that had scared me so badly I had nightmares about it—it was a painting of a man devouring the bloodied corpse of a child. I now know that it was Francisco Goya’s *Saturn Devouring His Son.* Was *that* what Susan meant? I couldn’t understand how *else* there could be a baby in her stomach. But she was a nice woman. I didn’t think she could be a baby-eater.

It had to be a joke. I smiled, laughed, and the queasiness subsided. Susan cocked her head and asked me what was funny.

“There can’t be a baby in there,” I said.

“Sure, there can,” she said. “Babies grow in here, and when they’re all ready to take on the world, they come out. That’s how all of us got here.”

“Me too?” I asked.

She nodded. “Yes, even you.”

“And you?”

“And me.”

The queasiness was back. What if they weren’t joking? What if…

I gulped.

“There’s a…living thing *inside* you? Like a parasite?” I’d read about parasites—as a kid, I got into a lot of books I wasn’t supposed to. I knew they took up residence in a person’s body and ate that person’s food and that they were really gross.

“Not a parasite, Lucy,” Mom admonished. “A *baby.*”

“It’s all right, Martha,” Susan said. “Would you like to feel, Lucy?”

She lifted the bottom of her shirt, revealing her basketball-shaped belly. I took a tentative step forward, arm outstretched, and looked up at Susan. She nodded, smiled, and I reached the rest of the way, resting my hand on her bellybutton.

I didn’t feel a thing. They were just playing around after—

I jerked my hand back and cried out in shock. Something moved in there! Susan put a hand to her mouth, suppressing a giggle.

“I’m sorry,” she said. “I should have mentioned that he kicks sometimes. It can startle you if you’re not expecting it.”

I stood stock still, staring at her belly where that thing had just lashed out at me. Then, I cried. I bawled and bawled because, like all children, I knew of no other way to cope with those moments when our blissful ignorance is torn asunder, and we are exposed to the cold hard truths of reality. Most wouldn’t count the revelation of where babies come from to be among such truths, but for me, it was every bit as harsh as learning about war, starvation, illness, or death.

That night, Mom came into my room and sat on the edge of my bed. “Lucy,” she told me. “Pregnancy is perfectly normal. It’s nothing to be afraid of. I was once pregnant for nine months, and nothing bad happened to me. Just the opposite, in fact—I gave birth to *you.* And I suspect that someday, you’ll get pregnant and give birth to a beautiful child of your own.”

I nodded, wiping away tears. But deep down, I knew she was wrong. I never, ever, *ever* wanted to get pregnant.

Time goes on, though, and things change.

___

*Badum. Badum. Badum.* The rhythmic, drum-like sound echoed in the dark. I stood submerged to my waist in cold water, bubbles gurgling to its surface and popping like snapping teeth.

The water stirred. Something splashed to my left. A sheer wall emerged from the black, approaching too fast to be avoided. The wall constricted around me, and I discerned it to be a hand, each of its fingers as large as a full-grown human. I shrieked, futilely pounding on flesh as it lifted me from the water. My captor’s face came into view. It was a baby. In its eyes, I saw something I thought no baby was capable of.

Hatred, pure and unadulterated.

It began to cry.

I jolted awake with a gasp. I wasn’t in bed. The surface beneath me was hard. I moved my hand and brushed something cool and smooth—the porcelain base of the toilet.

A second later, I was glad to be where I was. Nausea struck, and I pulled myself up and heaved bile into the bowl. Then again. And again. The amount of puke flowing out of me felt like three times what I’d eaten in the last *week*, and it kept coming. It was like I was some kind of puke hose. Finally, it stopped, and I fell back, gasping for breath, throat burning, taste of vomit on my tongue. I went to the sink and attempted to drink, but my body refused it. I gargled and spat instead, until the taste was mostly gone.

Todd was awake with the lamp on when I returned to the bedroom. “Morning sickness again?” he asked.

“Mm-hmm.” I climbed into bed and dragged the red comforter over myself.

“You’re doing great, babe,” he said, placing a hand on my shoulder. “Just three months to go.”

“Yeah.”

His expression turned curious, perhaps a bit uneasy. “Something wrong?”

“Another nightmare.”

“Oof,” he said. “A nightmare *and* morning sickness?”

“Pregnancy’s a blast,” I said with a grin.

“Do you want to talk about the nightmare?”

My therapist had told me I should talk to Todd about any nightmares related to childbirth. Back at the start of my pregnancy, I’d had a nightmare nearly every night, sometimes more than one. Tonight’s was the first I’d had in three weeks. I think it was safe to say talking about them had helped.

“Okay. I was in a dark, watery chamber…I think it was a womb. There was a baby in there with me, a giant baby. It grabbed me, and I couldn’t get away.”

“That all?”

“That’s when I woke up. But there’s something else.”

His eyes narrowed.

“The baby had this hateful expression. Like it was angry at me.”

“Why would it be angry at you?” he asked.

“Because...”

He waited. I searched for the right words but couldn’t find them.

“Never mind.”

We’d been down that road before, and it didn’t end well. Despite my evasion, Todd picked up on where I’d been about to go.

“He’ll have a good life,” he said. “I promise.”

Could you really promise something like that? There was so much that could go wrong, so much we had no control over. But Todd’s smile reassured me, a reminder we could cross that bridge when we came to it. For now, why not hope for the best?

“I love you, Lucy,” Todd said.

I kissed him on the cheek, running my hands through his soft, curly brown hair. “I love you too.”

Todd turned out the light, and ten minutes later, he was snoring. I tried to join him, but I couldn’t. I tossed and turned beneath the sheets, my mind ablaze with apprehension about three months from now. After half an hour, I gave up. I opened a book and read a couple pages but couldn’t get into it, so I stared at the ceiling for a while and then got up to pour myself a glass of water. I brought it to my office, next door to the bedroom, and turned on my green desk lamp. Chaucer, our cat, lay stretched out on top of my laptop. He raised his orange head and yawned at me.

“Let’s go, buddy. You know you’re not supposed to be up on the desk.”

I picked him up and put him down on the floor. He fussed a little but decided the carpet was good enough and curled up at my feet. I opened the desk drawer and pulled out the stack of student papers I’d begun grading that afternoon.

The office door rattled. I looked at it. Shut. Had I shut it? I thought for sure I’d left it open.

Chaucer meowed. Not from my feet, but from *outside* the door. It rattled again. He was out there, pawing at the wood.

*Meew.*

*What on Earth*? Could I really have imagined him sitting on the desk? Imagined the feel and weight of him in my arms when I lifted him? Mom did tell me pregnancy messed with her head sometimes, but she’d never mentioned hallucinations.

Just another item to add to the list of “things to tell my doctor.” That list was starting to get long.

*Meeeew.* Rattle, rattle, rattle. Chaucer wasn’t gonna give up, apparently. I let him in, and he hopped, purring, onto my lap. Red pen in hand, I set to work on the papers. I read about themes, symbolism, and metaphors until my tiredness returned.

I was just about to get up and try my pillow again when I read something that snapped me back awake. I dropped the sheet of paper from my shaking hands, the sudden sickness in my stomach having nothing to do with the person growing inside.

On the back of his paper, one of my twelfth-grade students had written a poem.

*I’m gonna cut you, bitch.*

*I’m gonna gut you, bitch.*

*I’m gonna haunt you like an itch.*

*You and me? We’re gonna have fun*.

___


“You have to tell Dierdre,” Todd said.

*Tell the principal*? I thought. *But...Timothy was just screwing around when he wrote that...right*?

“I don’t think that’s necessary,” I said.

He raised an eyebrow. “You don’t? Really? For calling you a *bitch* and threatening to *cut* you and *gut* you?”

“Timothy’s a bright kid with a bright future,” I said. “If I took this to Dierdre, he’d be…”

“Any punishment he gets will be both necessary and justified, considering the climate we live in,” Todd said. “Columbine? Marjory Stoneman Douglas?”

“That’s a little extreme to be bringing *those* up, isn’t it? I mean, Timothy wouldn’t…”

“Do you *know* that? Because the teachers of *those* kids must have thought the same thing.”

I thought about it. Timothy, always saying hi to me before class. Timothy, always holding open the door. Timothy, a school shooter? True, I’d caught him drawing violent pictures in class before, but I’d thought nothing of it. He was a teenage boy after all and probably just played a little too much Grand Theft Auto, or whatever the big violent game was nowadays. I tried to imagine his smiling face beside a headline beginning with the words “X number dead in…” and couldn’t.

But...

*I’m gonna cut you, bitch.*

*I’m gonna gut you, bitch.*

*His* handwriting. *His* name on the front page of the essay.

Todd was right. In this day and age, one couldn’t afford to take chances.

“I’ll tell Dierdre,” I said.

“I know you care about all your students, but you’re making the right choice,” Todd said. He gave me a pat on the belly. “After all, you’ve gotta keep your*selves* safe.”

___


Doctor Dierdre Thompson tapped her pencil on her desk. “This is serious,” she said. “Timothy, why did you write this on the back of your English essay?”

Timothy sniffled. His eyes brimmed with tears. “I didn’t,” he said. “I *swear* I didn’t. It had to have been *someone else.*”

I hadn’t expected the waterworks or the lying. “Timothy, you’ve been in my class long enough for me to know your handwriting. No one else writes like you do. This is your poem.”

“It’s *not*,” Timothy sobbed.

I sighed. “We’re not mad at you. We just want to understand—”

“Oh, we’re mad,” Timothy’s father said. “We are most *certainly* mad.”

He sat with his arms crossed, a scowl on his face. Next to him sat his wife, her expression unreadable. I wanted to know what *she* was thinking—she’d hardly said a word since she’d come in. I got the sense her husband was the type who liked to take the lead on things, who liked the last word to be his. She probably was used to having her opinions brushed away, disregarded as frivolous.

“Let’s keep this constructive—” Dierdre began.

“Timothy’s going back to Mountain Crest,” his father interrupted.

Timothy gasped. “*No.*”

Mountain Crest? The behavioral health center? And did he say *back*?

“Yes,” his father said. “And we’re disenrolling you from this school. Come fall, you’ll get a chance to redo the ninth grade—at Poudre. They’re better at dealing with kids like you, I hear.”

“But I like it *here*,” Timothy said.

His father pounded the desk with his fist, and Timothy flinched. “*Then you shouldn’t’ve wrote this shit*!”

The room fell so quiet, all you could hear was Timothy’s weeping and the ticking of the clock on the wall. *Tick. Sob. Tick. Sob. Tick. Sob. Tick.*

“Mister Danton…,” Dierdre said.

He stood up. “It’s decided. Come on.” The three of them left the room, closing the door behind them.

___


“Damnit!” I kicked the stall door, and it swung away from me, striking the partition wall. It swung back my way, and I kicked it again.

This was such shit. Timothy didn’t deserve that, to be taken away from the life he’d built at this school and stuck in some *center*. Yet I’d been helpless to protect him from it. What kind of teacher was I? And did he even really write that? Did he *really*? Because the way he’d acted, it sure didn’t seem like he had. Could another student have forged it?

The baby kicked the inside of my stomach.

“*Damnit, damnit, damnit*!” I screamed, pounding the door with my fist. Why on *Earth* was someone like me, who couldn’t protect her own students, having a *baby*? What *fucking* right did I have to force someone into this world if I wouldn’t even be able to take *care* of them properly?

“Mrs. Kushner? Are you okay?”

Tonya Green, one of my students, stood in the doorway. At the sight of my face, she backed up. I looked in the mirror and saw I was a mess, normally tidy hair frazzled from my tearing at it, makeup sloughing down my tear-stricken face.

“I…I’m sorry, Tonya. Yes, I’m fine.”

“Did something happen?”

I very nearly snapped at her. *Of course, something happened. What does it look like*? And wouldn’t *that* be a good look on me—civil, always level-headed Mrs. Kushner going off on students for seemingly no good reason at all. There’d be rumors throughout the school within the hour about how my home life was a disaster, how my husband cheated on me, and I was broke and about to lose my house, and hey, you didn’t hear it from me, but did you know she sneaks shots of vodka between lectures? She’s got a serious problem, that Mrs. Kushner. She needs to see a *therapist.*

Joke’s on them. I was already seeing one.

“See you tomorrow,” I said and hurried out the door.

As soon as I entered the hallway, nausea struck. *Shit.* I turned to go back in the bathroom and stopped, hand on the door. I didn’t want to puke in front of Tonya on top of everything else. I rushed to a trash can by the wall and heaved up my guts.

Once finished, I wiped my face. *Good,* I thought, *no one saw.* Someone would notice eventually, but they’d think it was just some hungover student. I left the trash can and headed for the break room.

Pain ripped through my stomach. I cried out and doubled over, clutching myself. Then, I looked down.

*No,* I thought, heart suddenly pounding. *Oh God, no, no, no…*

I was bleeding, *down there.* The front of my jeans was stained red.

*This can’t be happening, please, I can’t lose the—*

I blinked. The blood was gone. I felt the jeans, but they weren’t wet. I’d imagined it? Christ, what was going *on* with me?

Thankfully, no one was around to witness what had happened. I hurried the rest of the way to the break room. Gertrude, a coworker—science teacher—was there, poring over a stack of student exams. She picked up her coffee mug and took a sip.

“I think I’ll get in on some of that coffee action myself,” I said. “Today has been *hell.*”

Gertrude looked up, and confusion set in on her face. “Lucy? Aren’t you supposed to be teaching right now?”

“No, I’ve got class at two-thirty,” I said.

“Lucy?” Gertrude’s expression changed to concern. “Lucy, it’s three o’ clock.”

“What?”

That couldn’t be. I looked at the clock on the wall and, with horror, saw that she was right.

I’d lost forty-five minutes.

___


I lay on a table. Leather straps cuffed my ankles, wrists, neck—the last one too tight. My breath came out ragged, hindered.

“*He’s awoken*,” a voice buzzed inside my skull. “*He’s coming.*”

“Who’s coming?”

A screen flickered to life in front of me. I saw the womb from my previous nightmare. A dark hole hung over the water. A serrated, needle-pointed claw poked through and more followed, three of them, like Freddy Krueger’s glove, and then—

I slammed my eyes shut, but it was no use. My flashing glimpse of the monster had seared it to my retinas. Its vile visage swam in the nothing behind my eyelids, sneering with bulging eyes, swollen tongue licking leprous, yellow lips.

Then pain. The abomination was mincing my insides, clawing, tearing, ripping at my guts with its finger-knives. I screamed.

“Lucy! Lucy, Jesus, wake up!”

It was Todd. I moved my arms. No restraints.

“Todd,” I whimpered. “I…”

“It’s okay, Lucy,” he said. “I’m right here. It’s okay.”

I fell into his arms, crying.

___


Grading papers was therapeutic, a way for me to drown out everything else that was happening.

I got to Tonya’s essay, and the memory of our last encounter broke through the spell. I cast the memory aside and continued. As usual, Tonya demonstrated impeccable skill for a high schooler—her ability to grasp the themes at the core of Joseph Conrad’s *Heart of Darkness* even made me, an English teacher, think of the book in ways I hadn’t before. I awarded her with an exceptionally rare ninety-nine out of a hundred and wrote some glowing words of praise beneath the score. Ashamedly, I looked at the rest of the stack with reluctance, confident that none of the remaining essays would live up to this one.

I transferred it to the *graded* pile, and as I did so, I noticed something written on the back and flipped it over.

I stood, hyperventilating, staring with wide eyes at the paper. The chair toppled to the floor behind me. *No. Please. How...Why is this on Tonya’s essay? Oh my God, what is happening?*

It was a poem.

*Stupid bitch.*

*See a problem,*

*First thing you do is snitch.*

*How are you sure that he did the deed?*

*Maybe you should give it another read.*

It was in Timothy’s handwriting.

I scrambled and took my phone out of my pocket, bringing up the picture I’d taken of Timothy’s poem in case the original got lost somehow. I read it over, once, twice, three times—Jesus. *There.* That little flourish on the lowercase i’s, I’d never seen Timothy use that on *anything.*

“Lucy?” Todd said. I barely registered him talking. “Lucy, what’s wrong?”

I stumbled away from the desk and fell onto the bed, bracing my throbbing temples. The room tilted, spun, objects uprooted from gravity, madly cartwheeling, slingshotting back and forth. Todd cried out, but the sound was far away. Self-loathing thoughts pelted me, stinging, bruising.

*How? How did you miss it? The forger added that detail on purpose to see if you’d notice, and being the blind, stupid loser that you are, you consigned an innocent boy to suffer for nothing. There you are, showing off that deficiency of brain cells again. How’d you ever become a teacher?*

The objects in the room tittered and jeered as I lost consciousness.

___


I woke in a bed that wasn’t mine, in a sterile white room surrounded by machines, something beeping beside me.

*Another nightmare,* I thought. My breath quickened as I imagined a portal forming, that terrible entity crawling forth. The beeping quickened in sync.

“It’s okay, Lucy. It’s okay.” Todd’s voice. He sat in a chair to my right, and when I saw him, the beeping slowed.

It wasn’t a nightmare—I was in the hospital.

A doctor told me I had fainted from a combined effect of severe stress and being pregnant. Luckily, the baby was unharmed. I was discharged, and Todd and I went home. I took the rest of the week off.

I spent a long time thinking about who might have written the poems, doubted it was random targeting—this had to be someone with a vendetta against me. I’d given out plenty of Fs over the years and punished plenty of delinquent behavior. Students who came in drunk or high, students who told me to go fuck myself, the list went on. Besides students, I’d had a few bad boyfriends. Dylan from college said he’d “make me sorry” for breaking up with him—had anything ever come of that? I’d always considered it to be an empty threat, but now I had to wonder.

Todd was receptive to my concern. He informed the police we’d thought of a possible suspect and asked the neighbors to be on the lookout for anyone suspicious. The pistol he normally kept in his safe migrated to the bedside table.

A few days after the fainting, the police called and spoke to Todd. When the call was finished, he asked me to join him at the kitchen table.

“Have they found anything out?” I asked.

Todd sighed. He laced and unlaced his fingers—one of his many nervous habits.

“Todd,” I pushed. “What did they say?”

“They did an analysis of the handwriting,” he said. “I’m sorry, I…I don’t know a good way to tell you this. They think that you did it.”

“They think that I…” I gaped at him. “You can’t believe that. Please, tell me you don’t.”

“They laid it all out. How you were the only one with access to both essays, details like that.”

“So, you *do* believe it.”

Todd swallowed, looked down. He couldn’t even look at me while making these ridiculous accusations.

“I don’t know,” he said finally. “I know what stress can do to someone. If you did this, I want you to know, I understand.”

I wanted to pound the table. I wanted to scream “fuck you.” Chaucer’s fluffy tail brushed against my leg, and I wanted to pick him up and throw him across the room. Then, from some other part of my mind, there came a creeping sense of doubt. The anger subsided.

What if I *had* done this? I thought about the strange episodes I’d had, the hallucinations and loss of time. I’d been meaning to tell Todd about them, but now that he suspected me of *this,* I didn’t think I could. It would only serve to convince him all the more that I was the culprit.

Even with my own doubts, I wasn’t ready to accept that yet.

“What if it’s real, Todd?”

He looked into my eyes, and I felt dismay. He didn’t believe it was.

“The police are clearly done with the case, so we can’t expect much help from them,” he said. “We can keep doing what we’ve been doing, but beyond that, I’m out of ideas.”

___


Cold. Too cold. Wind blew past, fluttering my nightgown.

The yard. Sleepwalking again. I took a step toward the porch, and the bushes rustled at the edge of the yard. I turned just in time to see a man in black pants and a hoodie streak behind the side of the house.

“Hey!” I shouted.

I followed. The intruder was scrambling to get over the back fence. I sprinted at him.

“Stop right there, Dylan! It’s you, isn’t it!”

He went over. I cursed. I grabbed the top of the fence and attempted to hoist myself up, but the fence was taller than I was, and I was six months pregnant.

*Meeeew.*

I stopped trying and turned around. Was that Chaucer? It couldn’t have been. We never let Chaucer outside.

*Meeeeew.* My breath caught in my throat. No mistaking it, that was Chaucer—and he sounded as if he was in pain. I dropped to the ground by the hedges, where I was assaulted by a putrid stench. After shoving away leaves, I searched with my hands until I found fur. It was slick and wet. I pulled my hand back. It was covered in blood.

The blood was pooling from Chaucer’s ripped-open torso. He looked at me, yellow eyes full of agony and terror, and gave a pitiful cry. *Meeeeeeeew.*

___


I stared at the white popcorn ceiling, unable to fall asleep. The light and traffic from outside our roadside motel—where we’d come to hide for the time being—didn’t help, but mostly it was my thoughts that kept me awake. Chaucer’s butchered corpse refused to leave me, there when I closed my eyes, there when I didn’t. And Dylan, his wicked grin, his final words to me on repeat.

*I’ll make you sorry.*

Todd doubted Dylan could find us here. We’d been as careful as we could be, but it wasn’t enough to placate me.

*I’ll make you sorry.* I let him in when I sleepwalked outside and left the door unlocked. That’s how he got Chaucer. I let him in…

Fuck—vomit incoming.

I rushed to the bathroom and spewed half my insides into the toilet, then sat gasping, looking at what had come out of me. An ugly mixture of orange liquid and brown bits, stinking like no tomorrow. Perfect metaphor for my life at the moment. I flushed and washed my hands and face in the sink.

“*Stupid bitch.*”

I jerked the faucet handle to the off position, heart racing. *Someone’s in here.* I looked at the shower, its glass door shut. Shakily, I reached for the handle.

“Hello?” I whispered.

No answer, so I opened it. The shower was empty.

The baby’s foot kicked inside me, slightly painful and entirely unexpected. At exactly the same time, “*Stupid* bitch.”

I ran out of the bathroom. “Todd! Todd, wake up!” I screamed.

The bedside lamp clicked on, and light filled the motel room.

“Lucy, what is it?” Todd asked.

“Someone’s here! Oh God, someone’s here!”

“*Stupid bitch. Stupid bitch. Stupid bitch. Stupid bitch*!”

I threw my hands to my ears, but it was useless. The voice wouldn’t stop.

“*Stupid bitch, stupid bitch, stupid bitch, bitch,* bitch!”

Todd grabbed his pistol and checked the few parts of the room where someone could hide, but all of them were empty. He gave me a confused look. “I think you had another nightmare,” he said.

I hadn’t had a nightmare. I was *having* one. “*Bitch!*” the voice bellowed. “*Bitch! Bitch!* Bitch! Bitch!*”*

“Who are you?” I whispered. “Why are you doing this to me?”

He stopped shouting. “*You know who I am.*”

“I don’t. Please. Tell me.”

The baby kicked again. “*Waaah! Waaah! Waaah! That clue you in*?”

“Christ. I’m going insane. That’s it, isn’t it?”

The baby kicked again, again, again. “*Waaaaaaaaaaaaah!*” he yelled. *“You’re gonna be wishing you were insane, you festering tramp! Waaaaaaaaaaaaaah!*”

“Lucy?” Todd asked.

“*How’d you like the poems I wrote you*? *Weren’t they swell*?”

“Can’t you hear it?” I asked Todd. “Can’t you hear him talking?”

“Hear who, Lucy? Who are you talking about?”

*I* am *insane. I need help…*

“*Don’t believe me? Okay then. Three…two…one…go!*”

Pain. An explosion of agony, worse than I’d ever felt in my life. Stabbing, shooting, burning through my abdomen, as if someone had lit a fire within. I screamed and screamed, thrashing, clutching my belly and begging for it to stop. For *him* to *make* it stop.

“*Do you believe me now? Do you?* Waaaaaaaaaaaaah!”

___


“*I see you looking at the floor,*” he said. “*I see everything you see. I’m sure those gears a-turning in your head are thinking—ha, generous word when it comes to you—I’m sure they’re thinking something like this*…*What if I fall onto my stomach and don’t catch myself? What if I keep doing it until this little lump inside me is no more? That about right*?”

“Shut up,” I whispered.

“*Maybe one of those pills you were looking up earlier will do it. What was it? Mifepristone? Illegal in the U.S. but not in Mexico. So, you’re thinking, maybe you and Todd should take a trip to Margaritaland. You’ll say you’re going shopping and slip down to the clinic to get the pill. But it’s not going to work. Do you know why?*”

“Shut. Up.”

“*You’re awfully rude. Here, let me explain it for you.*”

In an instant, my surroundings changed. I’d been sitting in the bathroom, but now I was on the bed.

“What…”

“*You don’t remember walking here? That’s because we share a body now. I can take over whenever I want. So just go ahead and try to get rid of me. I’ll stop any attempt you make.* *And that’s not all I can do.*”

“Hello, Lucy.”

I shot upright. That voice—

“Been a long time, hasn’t it?”

“Dylan!”

He was beside the bed, grinning at me. Then, in the blink of an eye, he was gone.

“*You monkeys are of such simple design. So easy to hack. It’s nothing at all to fuck with your senses. Maybe you’ve seen some strange stuff that turned out not to be real? Thought you were going mad? Courtesy of yours truly! As for Dylan, he’s probably in some California prison or something. Who knows?*”

Something soft and wet brushed against my leg. I didn’t want to look down, but *he* forced me to. Chaucer’s brutalized corpse sat there, licking its paws. It looked at me and opened its mouth. *Mew.*

“*It was you, you know. You’re the one who killed him. Your hands, anyway.*”

“Why are you doing this?”

“*You wanted a child. Well, I’m sorry, Mother, but your* child *doesn’t want* you.*”*

Chaucer disappeared.

“*From now on,*” my tormentor said, e*very time you see something, every time you hear something, every time you experience anything at all, you’re going to have to ask yourself—did that really happen*?”

___


Todd returned from work at about 5:00 p.m. He took off his jacket and shoes and joined me in bed with a hug and a kiss.

“With everything that’s been going on, I nearly forgot that our anniversary is in two days,” he said.

I looked at him. That was right, wasn’t it? Fifteen years—we’d done pretty well for ourselves.

“I was thinking,” he said, “maybe we could—”

The setting changed. The bed, the blue walls, the beige carpet, and Todd, all gone. White walls and white floor replaced them. Cupboards and a dishwasher to my left, a table a few feet away—and beside it, a trio of gawking women.

The employee break room at the school.

“Lucy…What are you…My God.” That was Gertrude, my coworker.

At the sound of splashing, I looked down to see my pants around my knees. I was peeing on the floor.

Quick as a snap, I was back in the bedroom with Todd. But it wasn’t the same affectionate scene I’d left a moment ago—now, he was *crying.*

“What’s this, Lucy?” he asked. He showed me a piece of paper, with a list on it.

*Can’t leave a trail. Has to seem like it happened naturally. Options:*

*1* *Trauma to the abdominal area.*

*2* *Medication—Mifepristone if I can get it.*

*3* *Back-alley doctors willing to perform operation?*

“I…” *I never wrote those things down.*

“You’re trying to kill our baby.” He could barely get the words out. “You’re trying to fucking *kill* him.”

“No—”

“The school called. They told me what you did.”

The peeing on the floor? Just how much time was passing between these transitions? How long was he taking control?

Like a poorly edited movie, the setting changed again. I was in the car, and Todd was driving.

“*He’s taking you to the funny farm. The nuthouse. Are you just gonna let him do that? What are you, a pistachio?*”

“Don’t do this, Todd,” I said.

“I’m sorry. I don’t know what else I *can* do. You need help, Lucy.”

The car slowed, then stopped. Some kids were in the crosswalk.

“I’m sorry too,” I said.

I threw open the door and jumped out.

“Lucy! Lucy, don’t—”

Cut. Standing next to Todd’s car in a parking lot. He wasn’t in it.

Cut. In a grove of trees by the river, out of breath.

One last cut. I found myself back home. There was blood on my clothes and Todd was nowhere to be found.

The baby hasn’t done or said anything since. But I know he’s in there, planning his next move.

I live in a rural town in the countryside, Oklahoma. It's a very secluded place, since I live near a mountain. It's pretty quiet, since most people have a small town mentality and don't venture out this far. I won't dwell too much on where I live, though.

I was driving home from a camping trip, and I couldn't believe what I saw. A hotel. I was confused why a hotel was all the way down here, but I was tired, and couldn't complain. I checked in, and entered my room. It was old fashioned, with one of those lamps you tap on to turn on. The bed was small, but it looked comfortable enough.

The curtains, however, didn't cover the window, and I found myself worrying about that, but for some reason I couldn't tell why.

I woke up at around 6:50. The smell hit me before my eyes adjusted to the light. It smelled like a mix of charcoal and old gasoline.

A narrow, gangling figure walked towards the window, before staring in. I couldn't move, and I didn't want to. I just wanted it to go away, but it continued to stare.

The thing was thin, with a bloated abdomen, covered with greenish-gray skin that seemed stretched over it. Its face, though barely visible, was even worse. It had two, beady, black eyes just above its mouth, the lips of which were dry and almost seemed fused together.

The cold air didn't seem to faze it. The blue of the early morning outlined the trees, giving the creature an even more eerie appearance. It began to tap on the window, and I could hear the clacking of its claw on the glass. I was terrified, practically forced to watch. When it couldn't get any response, it began to slam its head against the glass, leaving a disgusting stain.

After 3 entire minutes (judging by the digital clock just inside of my vision), the creature simply vanished from the window, into the woods, leaving a giant crack in the window, splattered with strange goo and what I could only assume to be blood.

I woke up hours later, the experience blotted out from my mind, until I saw the large crack in the window.  It shook me to the core, and it made the whole experience seem like something from a horror flick.

Despite the odd occurrence, I remained calm. I checked out of the hotel and drove back home. The air in my house, the sight of it, was completely free of any danger. It was exactly the way I left it, including the stuffy air. Walking to my bedroom, I opened the window to let in some cold air.

I laid down in my bed, and sudden fatigue overtook my mind. I woke up in the middle of the night, shivering. As a putrid scent hit my nose, I suddenly felt as though someone was watching me from somewhere I couldn't see. The hairs on the back of my neck stood on end. Something was standing in my closet. 

The door was slightly open, revealing a tall, lanky figure. Its head split open, revealing rows upon rows of teeth. I stood up, grabbed the pistol off of my nightstand, turned the safety off, and aimed it at the figure. I suddenly blacked out, falling over back onto my bed. 

When I awoke, my torso had a circle shaped laceration, just below my sternum. It was still bleeding, staining my sheets. my room was completely dark, except for the vague outline of the figure. I could make out its shape quite well, though. Its torso ripped open, revealing a glowing orange, reptilian eye. The closet door then shut, seemingly by itself. 

And now, I'm left contemplating what to do, as slowly I bleed out.

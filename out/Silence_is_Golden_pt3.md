My soul noped from my body at that moment, I couldn't do anything and I was powerless but if Mack and that thing wanted me. It would have to come get me. That night felt like years, the screams from Jim and Mack alternated as one became its puppet and the other was subjected to its horror. 
The sun finally started to peek through the windows when everything went quiet, the silence was amazing, it was rejuvenating, it was golden. I could hear what sounded like Mack shuffling into the room we were staying in and his dad doing the same across the house. My flight or fight response was too tired to respond to this but I was frozen all the same, but all he did was lay down in the futon beside me. I still couldn't sleep, my eyes burned from staying up all night, my heart permanently beating faster than an olympic runner. It was a few more hours before everyone started waking up. His grandfather came into the room to wake us, proclaiming how it was a beautiful day and we need not waste it away. I normally would roll my eyes at that but I welcomed the cheese, the nightmare was finally over and I could see the walls again, the floor was carpet, not pink organ flesh. Mack and his dad didn't get up right away so I ate breakfast with his Mom and Grandparents. During breakfast I decided to speak up and ask the question that had been burning in my mind all night.

“Hey, did you guys um hear anything last night" 

In that instant his grandmother shot me a look of murder, her eyes burning into mine as if to say I will cut your throat if you say another word. Mack's grandfather, though, lit up with so much delight and gave me a big toothy smile and asked me what I had heard. If you had been there you probably couldn't tell me if he was about to cry into laughter, or jump out of his seat and do a happy dance, could've been both for all I know. His grandmother's cold stare stabbed into me while I replied.

“I thought I heard an owl or something, probably just a dream"

Instantly his grandfather's expression faded with a look of utter disappointment. 

“Yeah we do get them out here on occasion but you were just dreaming sonny boy"

After an awkward breakfast, Mack and Jim finally woke up. They explained how they weren't hungry and swiftly started packing to leave. Mack's grandmother pulled me aside before we departed and told me something I'll never forget.

“You followed the rules, but you aren't safe."

“There's one last rule you'll need to follow for the rest of your life, don't talk about what happened last night, not to anyone, you don't know who it has."

“Now I love my family but my husband, Mack, and Jim are no longer themselves, they belong to it and they will spread it like a disease just like it did last night."

“I'm sorry you all got caught up in this but my husband made these plans without my knowledge, I tried to give you the best warning possible without upsetting him or it, please Ty try to live your life and forget this ever happened but remember the rules when you stay at anyone's place, you never know where it has been spread."

I gave a knowing nod as she gave me a half hearted smile and a sad look of regret. The car ride home was hard, Mack and Jim seemed themselves but I caught a glimpse of fear in Mrs. Gina's eyes in the rear view mirror a few times. Mack asked me if I wanted to spend the night with him at his parents house and I politely refused, I haven't talked to him since. I needed to share my story and get it off my chest, everything has been relatively normal. I never thought I would enjoy silence at night, that eerie sensation I used to get in the middle of the night when the house slept with no lights is peaceful now, sweet and calming, but last night I couldn't sleep. In the witching hours of the night I could hear it, a rhythmic pulsing and squelching throughout the house, and my dad... just came back from staying at his brother's house.

[I met with the folklore professor.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/x7tbc4/how_to_survive_college_im_trying_to_figure_the/)  I almost didn’t.  I admit I was a bit apprehensive about barging in on some random professor that I didn’t know and who didn’t know me.  The people that can just… go out and meet people like it’s no big deal always confuse me.  I don’t understand how they exist.  Every chance encounter isn’t an opportunity for a new friend, it’s an existential crisis over whether or not I’m worthy to exist.

Why yes I’m an introvert, thanks for asking.

Anyway, I’d managed to work up the nerve to go introduce myself to a total stranger, but was nearly foiled by being unable to find the popular culture department building.  According to the map it was on the north side of campus, across from the fraternity houses, and I wound up walking up and down the sidewalk for almost half an hour, searching for a sign or something that would indicate that this building houses the popular culture offices.

I did come across some boys having an impromptu party in the front yard of their rental house on the other side of the street.  They had a baby crocodile and were teaching it to ‘death roll’ with a red solo cup.  I cannot see any possible way this situation will end well.  Hopefully I’ll graduate before it grows up and/or turns into some unnatural monstrosity swimming around in the traveling river.

…it’s totally going to end up in the traveling river, isn’t it?

Crossing the street to see what the hell those idiots were doing turned out to be a boon, though.  The popular culture department isn’t actually on campus.  It’s directly across the street from campus, nestled in among the row of rental houses and shops lining the main road running parallel to the college.  I guess the university ran out of space and decided to make it work by buying one of those houses and turning the rooms into offices.

It’s a cute building.  Serious cottage-core vibes going on.  There’s flowering bushes along the walkway leading up to, the building is brick with a little chimney and fireplace in the lobby/living room, and there’s white shutters around all the windows.  My hometown has plenty of buildings like this, but the pristine aesthetic is usually ruined by someone replacing a car’s engine in the driveway or cows grazing in the front yard.

The cows shouldn’t be there.  But *someone* won’t fix their damn fence for five years running now and we just get cows randomly all over town.

The inside of the building attempted to be just as cozy as the exterior.  The uniformity of the mood broke down a bit, however, as the overstuffed furniture and doilies clashed somewhat with the bookshelves full of comic books and movie posters plastered over every inch of floral wallpaper available.

The folklore professor was easy to find because her office was the only one not covered in either movie or comic book clutter.  The door was open, but I tentatively knocked on the frame, and a woman that looked like the most generic proto-grandmother alive told me to come in.

She isn’t quite old enough to go full grandma.  But she’s well on the way down that road.  I suspect she’s responsible for all the doilies in the building.  She looks like the kind of person that’s into sewing and knitting and stuff.  Her shawl and patchwork skirt both looked handmade.

That might feel reassuring to some people, but considering where I came from it actually made me more uneasy.  If she pulled out a pot of tea, I was going to bolt.  She invited me in and I anxiously perched on the edge of the seat.

Professor Beatrice (not her real name but I feel I shouldn’t use last names and I don’t know her first name yet) smiled at me and asked which assignment I was having trouble with.  I stared at her blankly for a moment before blurting out that I wasn’t actually in any of her classes but I had a question and I hoped that was okay.

“My own students don’t make use of my office hours, so I’m not about to turn away someone with an interest in the subject,” she replied, a bit bemused.

“I’ve got a project for… an English class,” I fibbed.  “It’s about… modern uses of folklore in books… and stuff.  I’m having trouble figuring out some of the symbolism.”

I’m not sure why I was worried.  Apparently you dangle any sort of interest in the subject they’re passionate about and any professor will jump on it like a starving wolf.  I told her that I was having trouble in particular with the symbolism of objects and I didn’t know how to research it.  The internet wasn’t exactly reliable, after all.  After about thirty minutes of discussion, I left her office with instructions on what floor of the library to go to and what books to look at.

Apparently there’s a whole… dictionary of folklore motifs??  The library doesn’t let students check it out since they only have one copy and it’s like multiple books anyways, but it was just sitting there on the shelf and I could go look it up my object and find any references in documented folklore in there.

There were nearly four hundred entries under “magic utensils” and not one of them was a pencil, pen, or quill.  And honestly, I’m not even sure if the index would help me if I had I found it, because I don’t quite know what I was looking at.  It was pages and pages of some library catalog-esque numbering system and references to… people?  Publications?

I’m just gonna cross folklore off my list of things to major in.  I’m not sure I’m cut out for it.

I was about to go back through and look for any references to ‘books’ as the next best thing when I realized I was no longer alone.  There was a young man standing directly beside me, almost touching my elbow.  I was so startled I dropped the book, caught it on the way down, and then fumbled with it a bit to keep from dropping it the rest of the way.  The entire time, the student didn’t move, and as I glanced at him sideways while trying to avoid destroying the only copy of the folklore index the library had, I realized that his clothing was a bit out of time.

“Thank you for your warning about Patricia,” I said quietly, returning the book to the shelf.  “I don’t think she meant to be, but she was dangerous.”

He nodded faintly, his gaze focused straight ahead.  I covertly looked at the books in front of him to see if perhaps any of them were useful, but the spines were in the Russian alphabet, so I couldn’t have read them anyway.

“But why are you here now?” I asked.

“You need a guide.”

“I’m on the fifth floor.”

He turned to look at me and raised a hand, pointing at the windows behind me.

“But it’s here and the basement has already started flooding.”

I turned around.  Staring into the window was an eye.  The pupil almost entirely filled the pane.  I stared back at it in dim incomprehension.  We were *five floors up*.  Was this thing just hanging onto the side of the building like a giant spider?

“This way,” the ghost said.

He wasn’t giving me time to recover from my shock.  I guess being a ghost tends to rob you of your human emotions somewhat.  I hurried to follow him towards the stairs, glancing back over my shoulder at the eyeball.  Its pupil had shifted, just enough that I could see a trace of white at one edge of the window.  Its gaze was tracking the ghost.

It *is* following me.  Using me as bait.

“Fuck you!” I shrieked.  “I like this one!  You don’t get to kill this one!  Go take care of the damn possums instead!”

Then I ran for the staircase and followed the ghost down.  Well, I assume he went down, because I didn’t see him in the stairwell once I entered.  I hurried down four flights of stairs and then stopped short at the last landing before the ground level.

The stairwell was flooded.  If I wanted out, I’d have to swim down and through the open doors at the bottom, illuminated by the hazy fluorescent lights that still shone despite being submersed.  At least I didn’t have my backpack with me.  I did have the pencil, but it was in a waterproof case along with my cellphone.  I’ve learned a few things over the past semester, such as always having important things protected from sudden downpours or surprise floods.

I considered going back up and waiting it out.  The eyeball wasn’t after me, after all.  Yet the ghost had specifically sought me out because I would need a guide, and the way it told me of both the eyeball’s appearance and the basement flooding made me fear the two were linked.  Perhaps it brought the flood, just as it used the traveling river to move around in.

The water was also rising.  If I waited too long, I wouldn’t be able to swim out at all, and would then be stuck in this building as the water rose floor by floor, until the eyeball either found a way to access its prey or gave up.

I had a feeling it wasn’t going to give up.

I took a couple deep breaths.  I only had to get to the other side of the doorway, I reasoned.  Surely the ghost would be waiting for me.  That was what he did, according to the students.  Led people to safety.  I could follow him the short distance to the lobby and then I’d be out of the floodwaters.

The water was cold.  It nearly took my breath away when I jumped in.  I had leapt from the stairs, trying to get as close to the door as possible so I only had to go down and under.  The water encased me and for a moment I wasn’t sure of where I was as it boiled around me, disturbed from its placid calm by my impact.

There.  A faint light far ahead of me.  I was in front of the doorway.  I swam forwards, pulling myself through by the frame, and then I was in the stacks.  Books floated through the water all around me, bumping into my hands and legs as I tried to swim through, searching for a sign of the ghost.  Everywhere I looked was the same - rows of empty metal shelves, books drifting gently through the water like leaves.

Something touched my wrist.  I jerked my hand back and looked, heart pounding.  The ghost was beside me, gesturing for me to follow.  I swam just behind it, telling myself that it wasn’t far.  The lobby was just ahead.  I only had to keep going for a little longer.  It was such a short distance, not far to swim at all.  The ghost had brought me down the stairwell closest to the edge of the stacks.

A current of water surged into me, sending me tumbling through the water.  I twisted, trying to right myself, and turned myself around in the process.

The eye was behind me.  The bodies serving as its legs dangled with their toes touching the ground, legs slowly churning in the water.  The eye was fixed just beyond me.

The ghost.  I shoved at him, trying to push him away from me.  My hands went through his shoulder but he turned and began to run, moving through the water as if it were air.  I remained there, belatedly realizing that I’d managed to put myself *between* the two.

And the eye went after him.  I curled up into a ball, suspended in the water, and braced for the impact of it running right into me.  It was all I could think to do.  Freezing up again, when I should have been moving, getting out of the way, *anything* but hanging there in the water, expecting to die.

That impact never came.  One of the students - Patricia, I think, judging by the color of her jacket - raised an arm.  The muscles, dangling there uselessly a moment ago, snapped into life again.  Her hand grabbed hold of my ankle, she pulled, and I was dragged sideways through the water and shoved to the side.  The water churned around me as the eyeball rushed past, I was again tumbled head over heels - and then I fell.

I was through the curtain of water separating the stacks from the lobby.  I flailed in midair for a moment and then fell noisily to the ground, rolling a few feet before coming to a stop.  I jerked my head up, staring at where the monster had just been.

Nothing but rows of books, sitting dry and safe on their shelves.  I let out a shaking breath.

At least with it being the summer semester there was no one currently *in* the lobby to see my graceless fall.  I stumbled about on shaking legs for a few moments, panting and wheezing, reveling in the feel of fresh air in my lungs.  Then I staggered back towards the stacks, bracing for the feel of cold water enveloping me again.

Nothing.  The flood was gone.  I was out of that halfway space and it would not take me back.

There was nothing I could do for the drowned student.  I can only hope he escaped.

I haven’t gone back to the library.  I don’t want to lead the eye there again.

I couldn’t help but think that perhaps I could *delay* on the devil’s bargain.  I have three and a half years left, after all.  Couldn’t I lead the eye to some of the nastier creatures on campus and let it take them out?  Use it as the weapon it was meant to be?  Perhaps I was a bit too hasty to accept the devil’s offer, as panicked and upset as I was at the time.

I tried talking to Grayson about this.  He’s still around, after all, since he lives here and all.  I thought it might be nice to get some advice and honestly… I just wanted someone to talk to.  It only led to a fight.

Well.  It was more of a disagreement on how to handle the situation.  I didn’t give him all the details and it was apparent I was withholding a lot of information.  It’s obviously frustrating him and when he snapped at me that he couldn’t really give me advice about something he didn’t understand, I snapped back.

“You haven’t exactly been forthcoming with me!” I said.  “You live here and you’ve been acting like you didn’t know all about this place?!”

Yeah, that’s totally not what I went to talk to him about, but it just kind of happened.

“I *didn’t* know before I came here!” he replied, just as annoyed with me as I was with him.  “The town doesn’t talk openly about this.  Most of them don’t even believe there’s anything strange going on and it’s all student superstitions.  They play into it every Halloween like it’s just some big game to them.”

“But there *are* stories about this place.”

“Of course - but Ashley, it’s not like anyone sat me down and was like oh this is real and this isn’t.  I just… showed up here and learned for myself, same as everyone else.  The whole thing with that laundry alternate dimension?  I had *no idea* that was a thing, even after having been here longer than you.”

I reluctantly had to admit that seemed plausible.  It’s not quite the same situation back home, where everyone knows there’s creatures out there, but not having good information about what’s on campus - that I could believe.  Kate didn’t keep people outside the campground informed about what all went on, after all, and the town only heard what was spread by the staff themselves.  And we… well, I admit it.  I had a hand in embellishing certain aspects.

Look.  I didn’t have a lot of friends growing up on account of the whole introvert with low self-esteem thing and it was kind of nice to be the center of attention sometimes.  They didn’t need to know I had the literal most boring and safest job on the campground and never saw anything worse than a soggy twenty pulled out of someone’s sweaty bra.

“Besides,” Grayson continued.  “Let’s say that I did know everything.  I like being your friend but… this isn’t the kind of thing you just lay out on the table all at once, you know?  Even you’re not telling me everything right now.”

I could only stare at the ground between us uncomfortably at that.  He was right.  I wasn’t telling him even half of what was going on because I was afraid he’d get hurt because of me.  That he’d get involved with the devil as well, somehow, if he knew.  Could I really be angry at him for thinking the same thing - wondering if it was safe to tell this person that he’d only known a few months everything he knew about the campus?  What if I turned out to be another Maria?  Or worse - another Patricia?

“I don’t like keeping secrets,” I mumbled.

“I’m not angry,” he said.  “Just… if it’s eating at you so badly, then tell me and get it off your shoulders.  Otherwise, keep it to yourself and I’ll be fine with that - as long as you don’t take your guilt out on me.”

And that just made me feel worse.  I felt bad enough that I didn’t ask him the real question, the one I really needed advice on.  Now that he’s gone back home and I’ve written all this up and had time to reflect on it though, I think I wasn’t actually wanting advice.  I wanted someone to agree with me, because I know what needs to be done.

Do I let the eyeball monster run rampant for a bit longer, since it seems to be targeting other inhuman entities?

Or do I destroy it, because I feel guilty about what happened to the Rain Chasers and the creature’s destruction might grant me some measure of relief?

It’s a stupid thing to ask of myself.  My course is set.  It was set the moment I made a deal with the devil and accepted his damn pencil.  No - I think it was set before that, when it ran past me carried upon the bodies of people I’d inadvertently led to their fate.

Maybe it’s a weapon being wielded by the administration.  Maybe they want to gain control of the campus such that the inhuman things don’t eat so many of their tuition-paying student body.

But any weapon that was created upon the literal bodies of the unwitting cannot be allowed to continue.  Patricia grabbed me and if there’s even the slightest spark of her left in that body then I need to put it to rest.

Any reason I might come up with otherwise is simply a way to delay what needs to be done out of fear.[\[x\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/)

So I have been completely unable to find something to write with. It's actually aggravating because although I seem to be able to use my phone to write things down, I can't truly analyze my findings as well as I could if I had something to draw with. Like creating a map for example. Although, I'm not sure how well it would work.

Aside from that frustration, I woke up after a nap recently, the time of which was indeterminate. My phone's clock is stuck at 00:00 and the other clocks here just tick back and forth. Anyway, I woke up and found something curious outside of my book door.

Another book! Who would have thought? This one was different though because once I opened it, I realized just how fortunate I was.

The book was old and had what I can only assume was a fully deciphered language - the likes of which appeared to be the very same language I heard during the chant. I still don't know how it got there, or who deciphered it because (as envious as I might be) someone WROTE the deciphered words inside with black ink. Since then, I've been studying it diligently and learning everything I can. Furthermore, the book contains other information deep within.

I've learned enough about the language now that I'm able to understand a little about this place. As far as I can gather, the library once belonged to a zealot congregation that used it to store and study all manner of magical knowledge. But, it appears that something unexpected happened which caused some sort of strange rift to form. The rift connected the library to a dimensional crossroads that's currently unstable which is why it's always changing.

Another detail I learned is that the people in question were called, "The Laturiam" and they kept extensive records somewhere else in the library, I'm not certain where. Of course, all of this sounds outlandish and could quite possibly be nothing but bullshit. But, what else do I have to lose in believing?

Oh, one more thing. The chant. According to the language I've learned, I believe the mantra was, "Rise miasmic shadow bodarum." The last word I haven't been able to decipher yet because it doesn't seem to be anywhere in this book.

And before I forget. The library is a collection of literature from places and times both known and unknown. As far as the book says; it has the power to manifest oddities, or what it refers to as, "Irregular designs" for no apparent reason. This would explain the absolute nerve-destroying terror creatures I've been having to deal with.

Still nothing about how to get out. Or how I got in. I'll have to try and learn more.

So, I'm not sure how right I am with this, but I'm FAIRLY certain that the word "Bodarum," is actually a name. I think that some group of people are somewhere within the library worshipping this being. To what end, I do not know.

I forgot to mention in my last entry, but the man is relentless. He's back in full force just stomping around constantly; it makes it really difficult to sleep. Maybe that's his goal, just deprive me of my mental faculties until I reveal myself. Unfortunately for him - there's a vending machine with earplugs and although I can still feel the vibration of his stomping; it simply reminds me of when my mother would stomp down the halls of our home every morning before school. I've learned to associate the sensation with comfortability, even if it shouldn't be.

I've also got this really crazy theory. Ever since I read that book, I've been wondering as to why my section (the section with my shelter and necessities) never changes so drastically that I lose my way. And then, it came to me. I think that someway, somehow, I'm a bonding agent. What I mean is, I am like the glue holding this section together.

That sounds preposterous I know, but when you've been stuck in a place like this for as long as I think I have - you tend to let your mind wander. I've also come to the conclusion that there might be other parts of the library that are mainstays. Certain areas where there might be another person like me. Which, of course, would support the notion that the reason the man spared me was because someone else was standing in the shadows. Perhaps someone he's been hunting for a long time. Perhaps someone who might have placed a book at my door.

None of that is concrete information, just my perspective. It's also a little… wishful thinking. I really miss companionship.

Mrs. James has been moving around a lot lately. She doesn't move quickly, but I still find myself watching her whenever she's nearby. The tall man's shoes have been worn down so his socks and he just keeps walking. I hate to say this, but I feel a bit bad because he can't grasp the idea that I still find ways to slip in and out unnoticed. I shouldn't get too cocky though because of what happened the last time I was complacent.

I thought I heard a voice the other day, or… night, I'm not sure. The voice was calming and warm; it soothed my weary mind. However, it was probably just some trick by the library or a delusion. I only say that because I haven't seen any sort of sign of another person except for the book appearing at my door. That could have been something else entirely though, I can't say for sure.

One thing I am thankful for is the constant changing of books around me. There is never a shortage of material. I take solace in that fact, even if it is hard to read with how loud the man is sometimes. I usually just throw some earplugs in and try to escape to somewhere else within the old pages.

If anything - at least I'll have extensive knowledge of all sorts of things if I ever get out of here.

Something terrible has happened.

While I was gathering supplies from the vending machines, I heard quickened footsteps from outside the library lounge. I could not even begin to believe that suddenly the man had found me. But when he didn't enter the lounge, my fears were lessened and it gave me courage to poke my head out to see into the library. And when I did, I nearly fainted from surprise.

Another person, just like me, was running away from the man. They were using some weird book contraptions (crafted with other materials as well) to stave off the man's assault. I didn't dare get involved. I figured that I'd sooner die than actually be able to save someone. However, there was another part of me that was desperate for human contact and my wishes were being answered right before me.

I just couldn't will myself to intervene.

The other person ran off down a dark corridor and the man followed close behind. After a few minutes, I heard terrible screaming. The man hasn't returned, but I also haven't seen a single sign of the other person. I fear they were caught. My only chance at companionship… gone so quickly.

It's not a total loss though, Mrs. James has been around more frequently. While the situation with her head is still perplexing and ostensibly horrific; it doesn't bother me as much as it once did. She emits this aura that bathes me in contentment. Maybe that's just me losing my mind - the kind of solace I'm experiencing does crazy things to a person.

What's worse is that something new has emerged. And this time it doesn't resemble a human.

I was reading something about metallurgy when I sensed an unfamiliar presence. It was like something had phased into existence very close to my shelter. The air became cold and a faint gale whipped up. I shuddered and leaned back against the firm book wall behind me. This position also gave me a slight view between two books comprising my wall.

And I really don't know how to describe what I saw.

If I had to try - I'd say it was… ethereal? I mean, I could hardly tell something was even there. What I could see was enough to send a shiver down my spine, but it certainly wasn't anything I had ever seen before. The only comparison would be a wraith… of sorts; it appeared translucent but wispy at the same time with its form resembling more of a mist than anything else.

The longer I stared, the more visible it became. It still retained that mist-like form, but I started to be able to discern other aspects about it. For instance; it bore long claws that limply stretched to the floor and the hands those claws were attached to were obscured by a low-draping sleeve. My eyes traced the beings arm to the base of its misty hood. And at that moment; it turned its head.

Death. Horrifying and inescapable. Its face was that of a skull split in twain with a dangling mandible and sharp teeth. When it turned its head, I had to cover my mouth so I wouldn't breathe too loud. I never thought I'd ever see anything remotely close to that. I may seem excited, but I was shocked and terrified.

Its jaw swung back and forth while it searched. What it was looking for, I wasn't sure, I just hoped it wasn't me.

Whatever that thing was; it came and went swiftly like the wind but not before issuing a deviant smile in my direction. It knew I was there and it didn't do anything to me. But, I haven't been able to forget the look of its melting face. The beings chin drooped loosely off its dangling jaw and each eye was set deep within a dark and sunken socket.

Some kind of ectoplasmic substance dripped off its broken teeth and burned the carpet below. It also had a book tied to a chain wrapped around its waist. I don't really know what that means - after all, I was just glad it had come and gone.

I haven't seen that wraith thing since my last entry. I haven't even seen the man. What I have seen, is Mrs. James and… something else. Do you remember; it must have been weeks ago now, where I mentioned someone had been stacking books? Yeah, I found out who, or rather, what.

I was awoken from a routine nap by the sound of pages flipping. Once I gathered my mental faculties, I felt a primal rage brewing inside me. It's one thing to be roused from a quaint afternoon slumber by some sort of "real world" problem, but when it comes to seemingly being in a displaced reality? Well, I figured I could be without such bothersome annoyances.

Anyway, the pages continued to flip. It was like someone was picking up book after book just to skim through the pages like a poorly drawn sticky-note animation. I moved to a spot (quietly) where I could get a glimpse of the library beyond my shelter. At first, I didn't see ANYTHING, I just kept hearing that sound - ever present. However, a slight movement caught my eye.

And it all made sense. The reason I couldn't see the source was because my eyes were on the ground. Once I looked up, I realized my gaze should have stayed down.

It was long and clung to the ceiling. A grey, tattered blanket covered its entire body. But on its back were several holes torn into the cloth it wore. And just as I was about to question why - the answer was revealed. Six fleshy tendrils emerged from the creature's back and slid across the top of each nearby bookshelf. One tendril would pick up a book at random (or seemingly so) and then another would appear to scour the pages. I couldn't see the creature's head, if it even had one, so I had no idea how it could be reading.

Still, despite all the things I have seen thus far, that thing managed to strike a deep, fearful chord within my person. I wanted to burst from my shelter and run just to be even a few feet further away from whatever that thing was.

I noticed a part of it would move ever so slightly as the tendrils continued their work. When one was done with a book; it would make a neat-ish stack next to it. Which only made me quiver with the thought that I had already seen the remnants of this creature's antics without even knowing. And then I wondered if it had been on the ceiling the entire time.

No. It couldn't have been. Unless of course; it's not dangerous, but I have no reason to believe it isn't.

Whatever the case, I remained quiet. I admit though; it was somewhat… enchanting to watch this thing peruse pages.

That was until I heard the chanting. The same chanting from before.

The creature heard it too, or at least, it reacted to the newly present sound. It put every book down and began to scurry across the ceiling, but suddenly a crude arrow struck its side and the creature howled louder than anything I had ever heard inside of a library.

Then, it knocked a shelf over that was obstructing my vision to the closest aisle. And there, I saw five hooded figures each brandishing their own crude weaponry.

Two continued to chant while the rest pushed their assault against the book stacking creature. It whipped its tendrils at them but they just kept approaching. Soon enough, another arrow pierced it and the damage dealt must have been significant because the creature fell from the ceiling. It writhed on the floor before being silenced by a makeshift spear.

I just sat and watched. But I was more worried about being discovered. And in that moment, I feared those individuals more than the creature that was on the ceiling.

I'm not sure how I've been able to communicate with people online since I was under the impression none of that actually worked here, but I've been receiving helpful tips. I don't know how old they are, or who is sending them because my phone does not display time correctly, nor do any of the apps work properly. Hopefully people are following along and I apologize for the time it took to update you.

If you're reading this now - know that the group of zealots are still nearby. They never left and one of them keeps getting awfully close to my shelter. If I understand the language correctly; they want to set up a camp of some sort.

I'll be sure to update you soon. If I'm alive to do so.

Where's that tall man when you actually need him.

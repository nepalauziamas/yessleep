Crazy thing is, I recognize that this song isn't even in English. I have studied Latin and Cantonese in college, but this song seemed to be in a mixed version of both. The song sounded as if sirens sang it. The song didn't even rhyme!

Worst part is, this song keeps putting me to sleep and plunging me into a world of nightmares!

I listened for over a week now and I think that the song went like this:

>Illic 'a lux Zài nǐ de línghún shēn chù  
>  
>Yī zhǎn dēng, haec lux est mors  
>  
>Deus tuus falsus est; Nǐ huì wèi nǐ de zuì fùchū dàijià   
>  
>Ràng wǒmen zhǐdǎo nín, tibi verum infernum   
>  
>Peccatum tuum scies   
>  
> Nǐ huì bèi yǐndǎo dào gèng hǎo de dàodé 

The translation is, as far as I can tell from my knowledge of both languages,

>There's a light inside your heart  
>  
>Think about it, your light is death  
>  
>Your God is false; you will pay for your sin  
>  
>Let us guide you, show you your true hell  
>  
>You will know your sin  
>  
>And you will be guided to better morals

I keep going to church every Sunday to find the answers, but I keep only seeing a trapdoor opening. I keep going to fortunetellers, but they never saw a good future.

The night this all started, was the first time I had the nightmare that I have been having for one week and 5 days now! This is how the nightmare goes:

I wake up on a rocky floor that smells of brimstone. The sky is a deep purple, close to black. I wake up just as that world's sun is setting. The sunset appears beautiful, in its deep orange and purple colors.

And then. I see figures appearing like Biblical angels at first. But, these things slowly turn into clownish creatures. As though they were taking off masks of some form. I hear a childish laughter, that slowly but surely turns cruel. And after a minute, into even crueler laughter. By the fifth minute, it has turned into a fiendish cackle.

The first "angel" says,

"How foolish now that your Bible has taken its full foolish effect on you!"

The second one says,

"Ooh, you should have learned what a fucking demon Abraham is!"

The third one finally says,

"Alright, cishet man! How do you feel about having what you've done to the true saints done to YOU?!"

Before the first insult finishes, I wake up in a cold sweat. I've been remembering this nightmare because of the recurrences.

This morning, after I attended church, I felt cold chills. Not like the usual chill, this felt like ice all over my body all at once. It felt like I walked *through* something!

My wife was at a desk and was writing on some sort of paper. I peeked only to find that she had divorce papers mailed to her.

"Martha, what are you doing?!"

"This marriage can't go on any longer! My friends keep telling me I should go find a more suitable man! Well, I have found someone else!"

"But why!?"

"Don't 'but why' me, Samuel! My friends don't want me with you anymore, and I have closed my ears to their reasons why for too long!"

"Why, Martha!?"

"Listen, Samuel! You and your religious shits can go to hell for all I know! You support *slave labor* and you call for the elimination of *my friends* and, worst of all, you fucking *forced* me to marry you just to make your fucking church happy! It's time I listened to my heart and left you, you fucking right-winger shithead!"

And she stormed off, luggage taken with her. She drove off in our car and sped off on the highway.

I assume she is going to a court to go through with the divorce.

Anyway, I decided to take a catnap this afternoon and I nearly shit my pants and had the same nightmare.

But no song was sung to me that time. I went straight into the nightmare as soon as I closed my eyes.

Maybe that song was an incantation of some form.

After the nightmare was over, I decided to ask a fortuneteller for help. I decided to listen this time and he said this:

"Samuel Hill,"

...It's a coincidence my name is close to the one in the exclamation "What in Sam Hill?!"

"it's not too late to mend. However, today is the last day to choose your path. Will you turn away from the luring light and trap that Abraham has set for all humans and let your eyes adjust to the dark? Or will you continue on this evil path, and let True Hell consume you within the few days you'll have left in your life?

"Whichever you choose, it may not change what you have done for your cult, but your future will be affected by what your heart lets you choose. However, I sense that it is unlikely you will change your ways. The probability of you having the ability to turn away from your church and deadly trap is as little as 0.01%. But that does not mean you can't change.

"But if you do manage to know your sin and change to help others, come see me again. I will see the result of what you choose."

I called my wife to tell her the news of my finally listening to him, but she never answered. I tried calling her friends to apologize for everything, but I think they blocked my number. I'm now certain Martha thinks I'll never change.

I tried everything for the whole afternoon, from when I had lunch to now. Notes on cars saying to the people owning them with good vibes, sliding wholesome drawings I made to tell them they matter and should have their rights under doors, the whole shebang. But all I got in return was pure anger and stones thrown at me.

Now I'm thinking my actions have gone so far that they all hate me. It was as if my attempts to change were, to their eyes, bait for a trap, like a worm on a fishing hook.

And I've been backed into a corner as to what to do now.

I looked back on my actions. I looked up all my behaviors in the past on the Internet, and I got results that I was a narcissist, an asshole, some of how to notice your own narcissistic behaviors, et cetera...

I, for a whole 30 minutes, was bawling about what to do about myself. I tried smiling to a black child on the sidewalk, even, but their mom hurried them past me, and talked to them about what I was. She even said my smile was an evil smile!

I was hurriedly trying to look for ways to make up for it all, but not one person in the liberal town I was living in at the time even believed me when I said I wanted to change.

Now I'm ready to die. I feel like if everyone's going to say that I'm a lying asshole to the end, the only way left for me is death.

I want to listen and be better, knowing what I did is wrong, but now being the cishet white male that I am feels wrong. It feels like I can't have any more second chances. Should you discover this note, I'll be in the hell that I've been shown. My body will stay in this world, but I will not be back anytime soon.

I'm sorry, Martha. I'm sorry, Martha's friends, Alícia, Tina, Ezekiel, Yveta, and Hellä. I'm sorry, Mr. Johnson, my fortuneteller friend. I really did such wrongs in life, and I realize that what I did makes my attempts to change look like a lie. I notice that if I can't change in anyone's eyes, I would like to say that death is the only choice I have left. I hope you guys can find it in your hearts to forgive me, but if I really am beyond forgiving, I guess you can burn my body.

*This was the suicide note left by Samuel Roger Hill, who hanged himself in the living room of his house at about 6:30 PM today. He wasn't missed very much. The only people who did miss him were the members of his church, St. Johnathan Evangelical Church. Doctors say that he may have been driven to kill himself by insanity, but this has never been confirmed.*

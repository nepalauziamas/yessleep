>Ok I don't know who the fuck you think you are, but this can't be a real wikipedia page ABOUT ME. I sent it to my online friends and it didn't work for them, so who are you?! You don't even have an IP address, how is that possible?! This is creeping me out. How did you get all this accurate information about me?

>YOU'RE WRONG. HAHAHAHA. What I just did wasn't in your little prediction, was it?! Hahahaha, I won the LOTTERY. You "predicted" that I became depressed about buying losing lottery tickets today - so I went out and bought the winning numbers that YOU listed here, and look!! I won! Fucking dumbass, thanks for the heads up. And I've got such a long life to live. The second I wake up tomorrow I'm going to the lottery office and collecting my winnings and I can forget all about you - the law doesn't apply to rich people, yknow!

>It's almost the next day. That means there's only a few minutes left before... before we get to see if your dumb prediction is right. What are you gonna do? Come and shoot me or something? I can overpower you. I kinda accept it, honestly. It was worth it, yknow? I *loved* hurting you. I *loved* it.  
>  
>You loved it too, and you know it. You were *asking* for it, I saw you, that lemonade you gave me outside your house was so good, so *sweet*, just like you - I just knew I had to have you. Hell, I should've taken your brother while I had the chance. I could have kept you in my bunker for YEARS.  Nobody would have fucking found you, and I could have kept you, but I got bored of you, and maybe if you didn't fucking scream all the time (even though nobody could hear you, of course) I would've considered letting you live, but noooo, you just had to scream and cry.  
>  
>Y'know, it's so well hidden that the cops couldn't even find you when they came to visit even though you were screaming. How did it feel knowing help was right there and yet they couldn't hear you? It was SOOO easy to just pretend to be the friendly man who knows your parents and was *soooo* devastated when you dissapy4e2qw aeR

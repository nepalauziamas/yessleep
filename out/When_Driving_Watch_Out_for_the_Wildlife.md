I drove along the lonely, winding highway, a thick wall of pine trees enclosing the road on either side. It had been a while since I’d seen another car, or so much as a farmhouse. As much as I like the nature up here, there’s only so many trees you can see at a stretch before they start to get old. I drummed my fingers on the steering wheel.

“You won’t want to look up the directions on your cellular,” Flynch had told me. “I’m afraid the map data is a bit… outdated. The last fellow who tried that sort of thing found himself nearly driving off the edge of a condemned bridge.” Instead he’d handed me a yellowing map from his breast pocket. “Keep it close, my young friend. We wouldn’t want you to lose your way.”

Something didn’t sit right with me about all this, though I brushed it off. Can you blame me? I was desperate, after all. I looked over to the pet carrier in the passenger seat. Through the holes I could see a familiar pair of green eyes peeking quietly out at me. I hadn’t been able to find a sitter for Luna on such short notice, but that suited me fine. She’d always been a quiet cat, unusually well-behaved on car trips. Secretly I hoped that if I landed the job, this would simplify things and I could move in right away without going back to collect her. And besides… I appreciated the company. She had been my closest family for a long while now, after all.

The road stretched on. If all went well I’d get to town in time to look around a little and grab a bite to eat before I met with the representatives of the congregation. I wondered vaguely if they had a Tim Hort-

Something emerged from the treeline, stalking swiftly into the middle of the road. It was a big animal of some kind, strangely silhouetted. Moose? No, it looked too… low to the ground for that. But it was bigger than any black bear I’d ever seen. The only detail I could make out in the moment among its dark fur was a pair of red, glowing eyes.

All this passed through my mind in the span of seconds. “Christ on a Cracker!” I yelled, trying to swerve to avoid hitting the thing. But I didn’t have a lot of space to maneuver, and the trees were coming up on my right-

Everything went black. When I opened my eyes it was much later in the day, a thin fog beginning to roll over the treetops. As far as I could see through my car door, that is, because the only thing visible through my windshield was the massive tree trunk that had plowed halfway through the hood of my car. I had a splitting headache, and when I moved my fingers to my forehead, they came back bloody.

Crap, crap, crap. I looked over to the passenger seat, dread washing over me for a second. I breathed a sigh of relief. I’d secured the carrier well. I expected Luna to look shaken; but then, it had been – how many hours since the crash? I reached for my phone. Dead. So much for charging it in the car… I knew I should have plugged it in last night. “Kittycat?” I said softly, trying to keep my nervousness at the situation out of my voice. “You okay?”

Usually that would bring a little mew in response. Not so this time. It took her a moment to acknowledge me, and then she looked at me intently with those green eyes of hers – the kind of fixed stare I’d seen when she spotted a spider in the bathroom, or heard an unexpected noise from outside. Crap. She’d always been a skittish cat. It was why I babied her so much. Something like this couldn’t be easy on her nerves. I was tempted to open the carrier and pet her to calm her down, but I didn’t know if she’d bolt through the shattered windshield. I took a moment to consider my next steps, my heart pounding in my chest. At least we were both safe. I should get myself checked for a concussion, but – I closed my eyes and muttered a quick prayer of thanks. I got out of the car on shaky legs and grabbed my satchel alongside Luna’s carrier. She looked a little startled as I picked her up. “I’m here, Luna. I’m here, baby. Don’t worry, we’re going to be okay,” I murmured. Gradually she calmed at the sound of my voice – but she never took her eyes off me.

I stepped out onto the road and looked back at my car to survey the damage. Jesus. It was practically the accordion model now. It really was a miracle I’d gotten out unscathed. I reached for my pocket and pulled out the map Flynch had given me. Nothing to do but to start walking. The mist snaked around us as I made my way along the highway. The gash on my forehead didn’t sting as much as I thought, but I knew I must be a grisly sight. Suddenly I let out a laugh despite myself, half anxious, half mirthful. What a sight I must be. The hitchhiking, blood smeared priest with his emotional support cat in tow.

I walked for a while, feeling gradually returning to my legs. Luna ventured a soft meow from inside her carrier. It seemed the longer we walked, the closer she was getting to her old self. “I’m here, sweetie,” I kept telling her.

Suddenly I heard a twig snap from the treeline. I tensed up as a low rattling growl reached my ears. Oh God. The thing in the road from before. I didn’t know how I knew, but I knew it was back. I broke out into a sprint.

I ran faster than I remember running before in my life, faster even than when- No, couldn’t get distracted now thinking about the past. I tightened my grip on the handle of Luna’s carrier, my knuckles turning white. I was practically gliding along the road, but I could hear a horrible panting and the pounding of – hooves? – mere feet behind me. I didn’t know what the hell was chasing me, but I knew it couldn’t be good. Oh God, Oh God. Suddenly the trees started to thin. Through the mist I could see an old covered bridge up ahead. I felt a burst of adrenaline at the sight of it. I felt hot breath on the back of my neck, but I dove for that bridge. I think looking back it must have been God who gave me the final push I needed. I tripped and fell face first onto the planks of the bridge, Luna’s carrier sliding just out of reach. And-

…Nothing happened. I looked up. There was nothing behind me. Suddenly I heard a buzzing sound from my pocket. I reached for my phone as I got to my feet. Not dead after all. The battery must have just shaken loose during the crash or something. I exhaled deeply and took a look. One missed call. Lester Flynch. I remembered there being a bridge over a creek not far from the town limits. I decided I should check my map before calling back so I could let him know exactly where I was, though I didn’t expect him to believe me about the vanishing wild animal. I reached again for my pocket. Crap, I must have dropped the map in my haste to get away. Well, it didn’t matter now. The town couldn’t be far. I felt the adrenaline fading and sunk to my knees. Maybe I’d sit and rest a little while before phoning Flynch. I’d just had a hell of an experience. Maybe check social media. Reddit sounded good.

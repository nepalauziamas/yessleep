I didn’t tell Dr. Sutherland about the panic attacks. Or the mood swings. Or how most nights I lay awake staring at the bedroom ceiling, too afraid to close my eyes for more than thirty seconds at a time.

And I sure as hell didn’t breathe a word about the nerf bullets…

He could probably tell by the red splotches all over my face things weren’t exactly *stellar* at home. Still, anytime he asked a loaded question I simply forced a smile and said, “Nope, no problems here.”

He gave me a notebook to write in. He said people in my situation sometimes suffered from rolling blackouts, and that writing things down might help with the memory recollection.

My hands curled themselves into little fists as the bastard leaned forward in his armchair, close enough I could count his grey, bushy nose hairs. “We all just want what’s best for everyone, Robyn.”

I picked Kyle up from school. Back home, Molly had already changed out of her uniform and was scrolling through her phone. The two of them got stuck into their homework–after some gentle coercion–then we ate a dinner of beef stew and mashed potatoes.

Afterward, Molly went out with some friends I’d never met before. I told her to get back before ten, but at sixteen what girl listens to her mother? She’d no doubt be dodging my calls until midnight.

Kyle changed into his pyjamas then we read the latest Dogman book together. I cherished moments like those. He was a cheerful kid who loved cracking jokes, but in three years his teens would come speeding along and then—much like his sister—lying in bed next to his mom would only embarrass him.

All this, along with the hour I spent crying while flicking through old photo albums, went straight into the stupid journal.

\-

I dreamed about Chloe again that night. Like always, she climbed in through the upstairs window and dragged herself across the lounge, down the hall, and into my bedroom, leaving behind a trail of juicy blood as she went.

Her hard fingers scraped along the bedroom door as she shrieked, “Robyn, Robyn wake up!”

I got up, quietly shuffled into the lounge, pressed my head right against the window, and craned my neck from side to side. There was nothing out there except an empty side yard and, beyond that, the chest-high hedge we shared with the neighbours, the Rutherfords, for whom retirement meant sticking their noses into other people's business.

A single nerf bullet sat on the inner sill. I’d taken away Kyle’s blaster three weeks earlier because I thought never cleaned up after himself, but those darts kept appearing.

Was Chloe reaching out?

\-

Dr. Sutherland asked about her during our next appointment. Pleasant childhood memories—y’know, the few I had—made for easier reminiscing than what the good doctor probably *wanted* to talk about.

On my ninth birthday, this freckly kid at the playpark asked me to go out with him. I said no because his breath smelled horrible, so he snatched away the brand new Tamagotchi clipped onto my belt and stomped all over it.

I ran home crying to tell Chloe, who marched me back there and pinned the bully kid down. When the little shit refused to apologize, she wrestled his fancy new trainers off his feet, tied the laces together, and then threw them up over a lamppost.

Dr. Sutherland handed me a box of tissues. “She sounds like a wonderful sister.”

\-

In the kitchen, the sight of a recycling bin overflowing with wine bottles almost triggered another panic attack. I rubbed my eyes several times. When they didn’t vanish, I drove them to the dump–periodically glimpsing a distorted face in the rear-view mirror along the way–then I searched the house from top to bottom, discovering a packet of pills stashed under a clock on the bookshelf.

A drink really would have steadied my nerves, but the kids caught me stumbling around half-cut, there was a risk that news might reach both the doctor and my husband.

\-

On Friday morning, Molly announced her plan to go see Wolf Alice in London. She wouldn’t get home until Sunday evening. Molly, like her dear aunt, had blonde hair and warm, green eyes.

“Who are you going with?” I asked. “Where are you staying? And when did you plan on telling me?”

“James and Emma. James’ brother’s flat. And right now.”

Rubbing both temples, I took a deep breath, held it, and expelled all that toxic air. The ensuing argument was so played out it felt like we read it from a script.

Her: you’re the worst…all these dumb rules.

Me: I don’t know these people…it’s too dangerous.

Our dispute ended with her making a big, dramatic show of storming into her room.

\-

Every time Dr. Sutherland asked about Chloe, images of her weeping and blind with pain flashed before my eyes. I told a story about how, decades ago, the two of us practiced dancing along to ‘Wannabe’ by the Spice Girls in our parent's living room, despite them warning us not to.

In the second chorus, you lean your top half forward and kick your left leg back, and I did this so fast I accidentally hit Mom’s porcelain cat—the one that stood up on its hind legs batting an invisible string out of the air.

The stupid antique crashed onto the hardwood floor, cracking the face right down the middle. I went into a nuclear panic, only settling whenever Chloe promised she’d tell our parents *she* broke it, not me.

Mom came home and raised a storm powerful enough to blow the roof off while I hid upstairs, crying. When Dad got back, he received the hot tag, and I folded a pillow over my ears to drown out the screams. Six stitches I think Chloe needed. Plus some ugly bruises that lasted weeks.

Part of me wanted to tell Dr. Sutherland my dreams—my nightmares?—had escalated into glimpsing her while wide awake and finding foam darts everywhere, but he’d very obviously labeled me a basket case the instant my record landed on his desk. No sense handing him the smoking gun, too.

With all the grace and care of a constipated hippo, he steered the conversation toward my husband. Married life with Brian was like trying for a gold medal in the eggshell walking Olympics. Early in our relationship, I once casually told him I didn’t much like driving, and by the time the kids were potty trained, if I ever said I needed to nip down to the store, he’d fire back with, “No you hate driving, I’ll take you.”

Then I’d say something like, “That’s okay, I can—”

“I’ll take you,” he’d snap, already fetching his keys.

Of course, like most people, Dr. Sutherland believed my ex was a real stand-up guy. A proper bloke’s bloke who loved a bit of a laugh, know what I mean? Hell of a golfer, too; the pair routinely bumped into each other down at the driving range.

Funny that…

I sat up in the chair and said to the doctor, “The day Brian moved out I changed all the locks on the doors.”

“Mmhmm, mmhmm, and what about the drinking?” he asked, quickly changing the subject.

After an eye roll, I said, “I haven’t had a drop since that last…*hiccup*.”

\-

Every other weekend, Brian swooped in to spend quality time with the kids. Our divorce was really heating up: he’d demanded full custody due to my ‘improper’ behaviour, but that nasty habit of climbing out of his fancy BMW to punch drivers who sniped his parking spot or cut him off at an intersection really bit him in the ass.

If you talked to our friends and family, they all clearly had *some* notion about his temper, although most of them waved these outbursts aside with statements like, ‘have you seen the way people drive in this town?’

With the kids gone, I turned the house upside down. During the first inspection several months earlier, a social worker *almost* found a packet of pills stashed under my mattress; luckily, I spotted the foil wrapper peeking out at the very last second and quickly stuffed it up my sleeve, otherwise, he’d have sectioned me right then and there.

Molly denied any knowledge of them, and when I accused her of lying, my mother’s voice came out of my mouth. That scared the shit out of me–that I could sound anything like her. Quickly I apologised and ran into my bedroom, crying.

\-

That weekend, the grief came in waves that twisted the pit of my stomach. On Sunday, I woke up surrounded by a giant pool of sweat after Chloe crawled inside my room, again. 

There was another nerf bullet on the sill in the lounge. Either my sister kept reaching out from beyond the grave or, grudgingly, it was time to admit I’d lost my fucking mind…

\-

I told Dr. Sutherland how Chloe took all the fun with her when she died. She was your hall of fame ‘cool Aunt’, and some of that coolness rubbed off on me by symbiosis.

Take our nerf war, for example. It all started when I came home to an empty house one night. After a few minutes of shouting the kids’ names and frantically calling their phones, I heard whispers from the bathroom.

By the time I got there I already had the police on the line, ready to report a potential home invasion. That’s when Chloe ripped the shower curtain aside.

As a hail of nerf bullets pelted me in the face, I screamed so loud those old fogies next door claimed they suffered from tinnitus for the next two weeks. My sister keeled over laughing, along with Molly and Kyle, and when I finally stopped shaking three months later, I started seeing the funny side.

The event which followed became known as…the nerf wars. We’d surprise each other at home, the store, the park—anywhere besides work. The only rule: you take your opponent by surprise and hit them with a foam dart. Molly and Kyle helped set up sting operations, switched allegiances, and even acted as human shields on a number of occasions.

My absolute master stroke came one afternoon when Chloe took Kyle to the playpark. After jumping off the climbing frame, my son bolted over to his aunt and said a girl hurt her arm inside the tube tunnel and needed help. Chloe flew up the steps, crawled into the pipe on her elbows and knees, and found me flat on my stomach, nerf gun poised and ready.

“You sneaky bitch,” she grinned, as I nailed her right between the eyes.

Telling that story, grief and anxiety seeped out of me like hot air from a balloon. But then I heard Dr. Sutherland’s pen scratch against his notebook furiously.

Maybe he knew about the nerf bullets? Maybe he thought I’d left them around the house as a way of keeping my sister’s memory alive.

Would you listen to me? I should have been a psychiatrist…

\-

On Sunday night, Brian dropped off the kids.

“How’d you get on?” I asked Molly.

“Fine,” she said, making a cup of tea only for herself, not me. We used to take turns and drink them while watching trash TV together, but my blackout ended all that.

Kyle gave me the full play-by-play: their father took them to see Minions 2 and then they got McDonalds.

After he showered and changed into his pyjamas, we re-read an old edition of Captain Underpants, then I gently rapped Molly’s door and asked if I could come in. I sat on the edge of the bed and told her I didn’t like how far apart we’d grown.

“Whose fault is that?” she snapped, the phone screen lighting up her face.

As I reached out to put my hand on her shoulder, she scooted to the far side of the mattress. 

I bit my bottom lip to keep from crying. “Look, I know it wasn’t fair what I put you through, but I’m much better now. I swear.”

“Dad says you’re losing it again.”

What could I have said? *Oh, your father’s not the superhero you think he is. Throughout our relationship, he constantly accused me of messaging my exes. When he was happy, I was allowed to be happy, but when he stopped being happy...*

*You know who REALLY hated your dad? Aunt Chloe. She even went at him this one time when he screamed in my face for burning a chicken casserole.*

But I couldn’t say any of this, because I didn’t want my daughter to know she had a shitty, scumbag for a father. “That’s not true,” I said. “I’ve been sober for months.”

She looked at me, finally. “Oh yeah? Then why’d you accuse me of hiding some pills?”

I didn’t have an answer for that. 

I wallowed in bed a little while, never sleeping more than twenty minutes. Those bottles and pills weren’t mine. I think. Things were still so blurred. Plus, I’d been frightened and deeply depressed after the accident. Also, you know, if I’d taken them—*if*—it meant I’d have lost time again and wouldn’t remember.

Maybe my doped-up self tiptoed around the sleeping house, strategically placing nerf bullets to give sober me a glimmer of hope? Maybe the kids staying here wasn’t the best course of action…

\--

Dr. Sutherland finally asked about the night of the accident. I deliberately didn’t tell him that Chloe came over beforehand–that she wanted a girl’s night out, but the mere suggestion got me shaking.

“I thought the whole point of getting divorced was you didn’t have to worry what that bastard thinks?” she asked, arms folded across her chest.

“We’re not divorced, we’re *separated*.”

“Same thing. Besides, isn’t he in Portugal golfing with his friends?”

“He’d find out,” I said seriously. “I’ll bump into somebody who knows us.”

“So glad you got rid of that prick,” she muttered, more to herself than me. “You know who he reminds me of?”

“Don’t even say it,” I snapped, effectively ending the discussion right there.

Side by side on the sofa, we talked our way *around* my current predicament. She told me about her new job, the upcoming Vegas trip with her friends, and a bunch of other wonderful life events I’d missed out on.

Chloe, bless her heart, did everything to pull me out of my funk, but a permanent storm cloud had hung over me since the breakup.

We hugged goodbye at the door. Five minutes later, as I gathered our empty glasses and the cheeseboard, I glimpsed a face in the window of the upstairs lounge.

If left slightly ajar, you could use a bent coat hanger to unhook the inner latch and push the window open; my sister performed this trick on several occasions when I forgot my keys.

As I stood there, rooted on the spot, Chloe climbed into the house and launched a nerf dart at my face. “Gotcha,” she said, smirking.

That made me laugh for the first time in weeks.

Later that very same night, two officers arrived on my doorstep and told me about the accident. Their advice was not to look at the body because “You probably wouldn’t recognize her.”

That left my imagination to plug the gaps, which made me picture a corpse flayed of skin, laying in front of a car, broken glass jutting from the neck like a pincushion, jaw snapped in half, eyeballs squished into jelly.

In the weeks that followed, life became a series of rolling backouts intermixed with sleeping pills and alcohol. Occasionally, I forgot the kids had school. Every now and then, Molly cooked dinner for Kyle since I couldn’t. Then one night, during a rare moment of sobriety for me, she started WW3 by trying to sneak out late. Immediately two officers turned up in response to a ‘domestic disturbance’, social workers got involved, and they found me in a ‘compromised’ condition.

Then came the endless investigations, the mandatory wellness checks, and the court-ordered therapy…

Brian worked overtime painting me as the worst mother in the world: a carefully placed comment to a teacher here, a ‘chance’ meeting with Dr. Sutherland there. The lies never stopped.

Pills popped up around the house and empty wine bottles magically filled the recycling bin, not to mention those fucking nerf bullets fucking appearing out of fucking nowhere. I worked hard keeping all this secret since the experts would probably call them a coping mechanism. Or a persecution complex. Or an avoidance technique. Or perhaps a hysterical mother who can’t face reality.

And the worst part of all? Part of me slowly started believing they were right…

Back in Dr. Sutherland’s office, he kept his cold eyes fixed on mine, patiently waiting for me to answer his original question. I simply said the news about Chloe’s accident hit like an ice bath. 

\--

Out of nowhere, I found I couldn’t breathe. An intense, dizzying sadness overpowered me; a burst of emotion so intense it zapped my energy. I couldn’t go on like this. My family couldn’t go on like this.

Then, a scuffling. Fingernails scraping roughly across the door. Grunts, wails.

I hid under the blanket and squeezed my eyes shut while Chloe clawed her way across the room, up onto my bed. Through the sheets, I felt her sunken eyes all over me.

Every time I peeked out she pressed her forehead against mine, screaming for me to wake up. Eventually, she ripped the sheet away and shrieked loud enough to make me roll out of bed, suddenly alert. A single nerf bullet lay on the patch of carpet by the bedroom door.

Had I completely lost my marbles? Had I slipped myself more pills and laid out a little scavenger hunt? Maybe the doctor got it right–maybe getting sectioned would be best for my family.

Sick of all the hallucinations, I pulled on a gown and scooped up the dart. There was another in the hall. I collected it too.

Six more lay spread across the landing. I marched forward, gathering them I went, furious with myself. 

In the lounge, my eyes travelled across the floor, up the wall, and there I saw Chloe, reflected in the window, smiling and uninjured, the way I *wanted* to remember her. Hands pressed flat against the glass, she smiled, her head cocked to one side.

It was her. It was really, really her. My rock. The one who could make the sadness melt away with a joke or well-timed hug. She came back when little sis needed her most. So long as I had her, everything else would turn out okay.

“Chloe,” I shouted, my cheeks wet with tears. “I’ve missed you so much.”

I bolted over and pushed the window open. The glass collided with something solid, then a loud snap went up from below.

A shadowy figure lay sprawled in the rosebushes. I thought a burglar had planned on robbing us until I heard my husband groan.

Still in my gown, I rushed downstairs—ordering the kids back to bed as I passed their rooms—and around the side of the house, where I flicked on the landing light.

Kitted out all in black, Brian rolled around painfully, his left shoulder popped out of its socket.

“What the fuck do you think you’re doing?” I screamed.

“You stupid bitch,” he screamed back, jaw clenched. A backpack lay nearby. When I bent over to grab it, he moved to stop me but grimaced and clutched his side instead.

I rummaged through the pack and found pills, two empty wine bottles, and a bent-out-of-shape coat hanger. He’d been breaking in to frame me.

“You son of a bitch,” I said, now onto his little game.

Before I could react, he sprung up and threw himself into my chest hard. I went down and he came down on top of me, gouging my cheek, slapping me repeatedly, seizing my throat with his good arm. At one point he balled my hair inside his fist and used it to steer my head through wet dirt.

He called me a bitch, a whore, a stupid fucking cunt. Red spots spread across his cheeks and forehead as he said he wished he had killed me—that he *was* going to kill me.

By the time his little outburst finished, the Rutherfords were peeking up over the side hedge, already on the phone with 9-9-9. Above us, Kyle and Molly leaned out of the window, mouths gaping open.

My husband instantly turned on that signature charm and went into deflect mode. He only came over because I drunk-called him swearing I planned to kill myself *and* the kids. He simply wanted to protect them, obviously.

From the look on Molly’s face, I could see the pieces slowly fitting together. Her father just got caught with his pants down.

The bastard climbed into his car and sped away before the police arrived. No doubt he’d challenge my version of events in court, but the kids knew what really happened. That was enough. For now.

When things settled down, I put a deeply upset Kyle into bed and promised to explain everything more the next morning, then turned in myself.

Soon Molly came through the door carrying two cups of tea, her eyes all red and puffy.

Holding up my favourite mug, she said, “I thought this might help you sleep.”

She stood there a few seconds, lower lip wobbling. I pulled the sheet aside and motioned for her to hop in, and then we lay together a little while.

“I’m sorry about what I said before,” she said, her voice all choked up with emotion.

I told her none of that mattered now. That I wouldn’t have believed me either.

Kyle, unable to sleep, knocked on the door and also came in, then the three of us lay there all toasty and snug.

And suddenly, for the first time since the accident, I felt like things might turn out alright—that my family would get through this horrible mess, together.

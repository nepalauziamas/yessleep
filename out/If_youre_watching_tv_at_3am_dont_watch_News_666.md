I'm a night owl I would like to be a morning person who wakes up early and goes for a jog. But like always I end up staying up late and watching tv or scrolling through my phone and like any other day, I was up scrolling through YouTube trying to find a good video to watch.

I couldn't find any video that caught my eye so I decided to watch tv. But couldn't find anything good and by that time it was already 3 am. I thought I should get some rest until something came on. It said news 666 which caught me off guard because I might not be a religious person but wasn't 666 the devil's number. 

A man and a woman appeared on the screen sitting right next to each other, they seemed normal. The man had a mustache and seemed a little buff but not too much. And the woman looked beautiful blond hair, blue eyes, and a beautiful smile with red lipstick. The man finally spoke"Hello everyone and welcome to news 666. I'm Tom Maguire" the Lady then spoke, "And I'm Bridget McCain".

It seemed normal so I decided to keep watching mostly because I liked Bridget. The man then went "A shooting took place yesterday at 10:38 am at the Small point high school". It then shows the school but it was showing security footage of the shooter entering the school.

But it caught me off guard as they were showing the shooting the man killing the teens and teachers. Then it showed the shooter pointing the gun at himself and before he killed himself, I covered my eyes. When I looked again I wanted to vomit as it zoomed in on him. Half of his face was blown off with his eye hanging out.

It then went back to the news anchors and Tom had a big smile. I thought this was some sick joke but Bridget then spoke " In other news, a teen girl is on top of a building threatening to jump off for more we go to Paul". The news then went over to a reporter, standing on a building "Thanks Bridget yes a teen here is threatening to jump off" the camera then showed the girl behind him.

She had long brown hair and looked pale and she was wearing a jacket. She looked to be crying "Yes this girl thought her life had meaning but soon realized it had no meaning" I was shocked that the man was saying this to her right there. I was sweating at this point because I was worried thinking about what this man was saying would make her jump-off.

The girl looked at him confused "What?" Now I  was truly fearing for her life "Yeah you heard me now jump!" I was glued to the tv hoping someone would help fearing she would jump. The man got closer to her "I'm not gonna ask again now so jump!" She didn't move so he grabbed her by the hair"You kids always threatening to kill yourself but you always pussy out in the end". It went silent the only sound was my heavy breathing eyes glued to the tv with sweat running down my face.

The man then pushed the girl her screams echoed as she fell until they went silent and the man turned to the tv with a big smile. It was as if he was staring right at me as he said "Hell is empty and all the devils are here" it then switched back to Tom and Bridget both with big smiles on their faces. 

Bridget had blood running down from her nose but she continued smiling as if it was nothing. Tom went to take a sip of coffee from his cup but then realized he had no coffee, "Hey can I get some more coffee " nothing happened so he repeated himself. Bridget then spoke "They will be all in today's news so well be signing off as we say" but before she could finish Tom slammed his mug over her head which made me jump in shock.

"I want more fucking coffee, now" Bridget still had a smile across her face as blood ran down the side as if nothing happened. Tom's mug was smashed but he still held up what was left with blood on it screaming for coffee. The tv then went black and I sat back on my couch wondering what I watched. I tried searching up news 666 on my computer but found nothing on it.

And as of now Tom Maguire and Bridget McCain never existed but I wouldn't stop until I got more answers. I stayed up every night at 3 am waiting for it to come back on and tonight seemed like any other night until 2 familiar faces appeared on my tv with the "Hello and welcome everyone to news 666".

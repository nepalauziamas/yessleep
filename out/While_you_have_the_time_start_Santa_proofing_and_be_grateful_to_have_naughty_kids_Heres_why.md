When I was around 8 or 9, I went through my “little shit” phase. Not even Nanny McPhee would’ve been able to get me to behave. I was that misbehaved. I would bully siblings, throw tantrums, break things, pull the dog’s ears and tail and at school I would draw dicks on people's books. My parents even tried sending me to a counsellor because of my bad behaviour but after like, two sessions he told my parents there was no hope for me. I told him I’d kill his dog while his son watched. 

Anyway, Christmas finally came around and my siblings and I were very excited. My younger brother was excited to get a Nintendo DS, my younger sister was excited to get a Secret Safe Diary and I was excited to get some comic books. That day was the only day I acted like a normal child all year. I actually got on with my siblings, spoke to my parents and played with the dog. “Bed time” my parents said at around 10pm. Before going to bed, my siblings and I filled up a glass of milk and a bowl of double chocolate chip cookies for Santa to have as a snack when he visited. We left them on the fireplace so he’d see them easily and then we ran to our bedrooms. My brother and I shared a bedroom at the time and my sister had her own. We couldn’t sleep for ages. We spent maybe 3 hours chatting, twisting and turning trying to get to sleep, chatting, fixing our pillows, chatting until we finally dozed off. 

I can’t remember how long I was asleep for but I was awoken by the sound of a loud thump on the roof. It was him, Santa. I decided to stay in bed as to notspook him.. He came down the chimney with a loud bang when he hit the fireplace. He then spend a few minutes placing the presents under the tree and snacked on the milk and cookies we left out for him. I was waiting for him to leave so I could take a sneak peak at my comics but I heard his loud footsteps approach my bedroom.. He slowly opened the door and entered my room. I closed my eyes, pretending to be asleep.. He walked over to my bed first, stood over me for a few seconds and then walked over to my brother’s bed. I kept one eye open to see him. He looked over at me again and I shut my eye quickly. I decided to keep my eyes shut until he left but after a few minutes I could start to hear my brother’s bed shake. I opened my eye again and looked over at his bed. Santa was on top of my brother now on his stomach while my brother looked very still, as if he was frozen. 

“I-is he okay?” I whispered

Santa got off my brother and stood up. His pants must’ve accidentally fell down I thought to myself at the time as he quickly pulled them up before standing up. 

“You’re awake” he said

“Y-yes sir”

“Mmmmmm”

“I-is my brother okay?”

He looked down at my brother

“Your brother is fine”

“Then why were you on top of him?”

“I was just giving him a hug”

“Okay”

I sat up on the bed and rubbed my eyes.

“Did you bring me the comic books?” I asked

“You have been a very naughty boy this year, haven't you?”

“Yes, I-I’m sorry”

“Santa doesn’t bring presents to naughty boys”

“I’m sorry, I’ll-I’ll be good”

“Your brother here has been a good boy all year hasn’t he?”

“Yeah”

“Santa only brings presents to good boys and girls, like your brother here”

“I am really sorry, really, I swear”

“No presents for naughty boys I’m afraid”

I could feel a tear coming out of my right eye. 

“Go back to sleep. I will visit your sister now”

He started walking out of the room

“I-if I be good this year, will I get presents next year”

“Only if you be really good”

I wiped away the tear

“I will be, I promise”

“Good boy”

When he left the room, I looked over at my brother again who still looked to be frozen. His pants was off. “Strange” I thought. I heard my sister’s room door open and decided I’d go see what he was doing in her room. I peaked in the door and I saw him, standing beside my sister’s bed taking off his pants. He then started pulling down her pants but I intervened

“What are you doing?” I asked.

He turned around

“I thought I told you to go to sleep”

“I’m not tired”

“Go back to bed”

I took a quick look at my sister who also looked to be frozen. I knew there was something not right going on. 

“What did you do my brother and sister?” I asked

He stood up and started walking towards me

“You’re being a very naughty boy”

I backed away but he picked me up, threw me out of my sister’s room and locked her door. I tried to get back in with no luck. I kicked the door, no good.  I shouldered the door, no good either. I couldn’t get in. I could start to hear my sister’s bed shaking now.  As I was having no luck getting in myself, ran down to my parents bedroom to wake them up for help. I barged into their room. 

“MOM. DAD. WAKE UP” 

I jamp on them to wake them up but they were frozen too. 

“Mom, wake up, please. Dad, please” , I begged, crying. 

But they didn’t. My mom’s phone was on the bedside locker beside her. I picked it up and quickly dialed 911 but there was just a beep. 

“Please work, please work, please work”

I tried a few times but there was just a beep each time 

“Maybe the neighbours can help” I thought to myself.

I ran to the front door as quickly as I could but when I opened it I stopped almost instantaneously. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing.  The snow was frozen still mid air. I looked up in the sky and the clouds weren’t moving. There was also an airplane flying over that was frozen too.  There was a car stopped in the middle of the road. I ran to it and opened the door in hopes the person inside wasn’t frozen but they were. I could hear animal noises coming from the roof. It was Santa’s reindeer, all 8 of them attached to a sleigh.

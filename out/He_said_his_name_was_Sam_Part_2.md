I didn’t have time to process what Caroline just told me. She was no murderer. Whatever she’d done I knew it was in self-defense.

Upstairs, there was another knock. We both waited for another, but it was silent then.

I pushed my drink away from me and grabbed the longest kitchen knife hanging on the magnet strip above the counter.

“Are you sure he was dead?”

“One-hundred percent. Just looking at his body there was no chance. What do they call that?” Caroline took another knife from the magnet strip and we started toward the stairs.

“Injuries incompatible with life?”

“Yeah,” she said. “That.”

We walked cautiously up the stairs, at times stopping when the wood squeaked. I could see Caroline’s pulse in her neck. My own heart hammered so hard that each stair left me more lightheaded.

We searched all the rooms together in silence but there was nothing. No one. We stopped and convened in the den, both staring at the subfloor.

I stood guard with the knife, and phone flashlight while Caroline picked up the drill and started unscrewing the rest of the boards.

All the sheets that made up the subfloor were six-foot by three-foot pieces of plywood. They looked like lids, I realized. Lids to little coffins.

She lifted a piece out and leaned it against the wall and we both exhaled in relief as there was nothing out of the ordinary in the subfloor. No dark stains. No creepy writings. No second safe. Just dust and rodent droppings.

She unscrewed section after section, setting them against the wall and it was the same thing over and over. They revealed the standard innards of a house. In one of the sections there was a heavier concentration of tiny turds and the bloated body of a mouse. Next to it there was a hole the size of a fist. I figured the mouse must have friends. A bit of the weight lifted from our shoulders.

“Is that all we heard?” I said. “Mice?”

Caroline didn’t respond.

We were both standing about a foot under the original floor now that all the plywood had been removed. Caroline set her hands on her hips and took deep breaths. She walked to where the sheets were leaned against the wall and flicked through them like giant dominos.

“We weren’t hearing things,” I said.

“Michael.”

“That was too fucking big to be a rodent.”

“Michael,” Caroline said louder.

I turned to her and her eyes were so wide in horror I couldn’t bring myself to look where she was.

“Shine the light,” she said.

As I did, she pivoted a piece of plywood on its edge to turn it out towards us.

The underside of the subfloor sheet was covered in long, bloody scratches. She let it fall against the wall and quickly pivoted another one. And another.

They all had the same kind of scratches and as if we weren’t sure what caused such feverish and gruesome markings, an entire fingernail jutted out of one of them.

*How many boards?* I looked at horror at the floor. *How many little tombs in the subfloor?*

Nine.

Caroline let the board with the fingernail in it fall onto the scaffolding floor and started nearly running down the steps.

I was at her heels. “We need to call the police,” I said. “Caroline?” She made for the kitchen and once there splashed another shot of whiskey into her mug. “That’s not going to help right now.”

“Like hell it won’t,” she said and threw it back in one swallow. “Ugh,” she wiped her chin and looked at me. “Don’t you want to know?”

“Know what?”

“How I killed him?”

I was silent as she poured another drink.

“Of course.”

She kicked a chair out from under the table and it spun out to me, a nearly perfect invitation to sit.

I sat.

“He left me a letter one night. My sophomore year,” she pulled out a chair and sat across from me. “He wanted me to meet him. He’d never done that before,” she trailed off and looked nervously at the stairs.

“And did you?”

“He wanted to meet on some wooded street by Lehigh Mountain Park. He knew I had my leaners permit and he told me to take my dad’s truck. I snuck out that night and took the truck,” she sighed and pushed the drink she’d poured away.

“I was driving slow, looking for him around two in the morning. He was where he said he’d be, standing eerily with his hood up. But when I saw him… When I saw him I accelerated. I ran him over.”

She looked at me guiltily, but I said nothing.

“I was going forty, maybe. He hardly had time to react. His head went under the wheels. I dragged him deep into the woods. I mean *deep*. There was this old culvert at least one hundred yards in, surrounded by buckthorn. It took me a half hour to get his body through that brush. I stuffed him in the drainpipe. That was it. I didn’t bury him, but he may as well have been.”

“Could he have washed away?”

Caroline shook her head. “There wasn’t even a gulley there anymore. It drained to nothing. Still does. I just checked.”

“Maybe his body was found?”

“Do you know how often I search results for body found in Lehigh Mountain Park?”

“Did you today?”

“Of course. There’s nothing.”

I leaned back and we were both silent with our thoughts for a minute.

“If anything, I think better of you, Caroline. You’re not a cold-blooded killer. I want you to know that. I understand you never telling me. I understand why you did it. And I love you all the same,” I reached across the table and took her hand in mine.

“Thank you, Michael.”

“But,” I sighed. “Don’t you think we need to call the police? There could be DNA on the blood on those boards. We could find who kidnapped Sarah, we—”

“Stop. We’re not calling anyone.”

“Why?”

“Because I don’t want to go to prison for the rest of my life.”

“They’re not going to find out. What possible evidence could there even be? Think about it. A truck that might have some DNA on it that is god knows where. No body. There’s no security camera footage from 13 years ago. You’re safe, Caroline.”

“The truck was scrapped.”

“See? Let’s call them. Now. I can’t sleep in this fucking house anymore.”

“Please,” said Caroline. “Can we please just call them in the morning?”

“Ok,” I sighed. “But don’t judge me when I check under the bed tonight.”

\_\_\_\_

We both called in from work and the police were over by 9am. It wasn’t the circus we thought it would be.

I had pictured satellite news trucks and squadrons of cops but in all only two cars came. One a patrol cruiser and the other an unmarked Ford Taurus of the detective.

We explained what we found down to the fingernail, but the response was subdued.

“We’ll try and get some DNA, see if we get any missing persons matches,” said the detective.

“We’ll swab around for fingerprints if that’s alright and look into the previous owners, as well. Is there anything else you can tell us?”

Caroline and I looked at each other. I had argued that we needed to tell them about the safe, but she had refused. We shook our heads.

“Ok, well if you think of or find anything else,” he smiled. “Be sure to give us a call.”

After the police left, I went out to the backyard. If there were any useful fingerprints, I knew they’d likely be on the safe. I sighed and stared at the tree line.

While we had neighbors on either side, behind our house was a couple dozen undeveloped acres of woods. The land ran downhill and after rains the water would runoff where the woods flattened, ready to flood the foundations of any ambitious developer.

The woods weren’t good for much. They were too thick, wet and steep for hiking and were mostly frequented by local teenagers to have bonfires and drink beer.

Someone could easily live in there, I thought. The tree line was right where it seemed the photo of Caroline had been taken.

I walked to the garage when I was startled by a voice.

“Hey, neighbor!”

I put my hand on my heart and smiled.

“Greg,” I said. “You scared me.”

“I’m sorry, and I’m sorry for being a nosy neighbor but I’m just wondering if everything is alright. I saw the police cars…”

Greg had earned his right to be nosy. A year ago, when I was backing out of my driveway my brakes stopped working. After bleeding the fluid to no avail, I called a tow truck to take my car to the shop.

Greg had come outside, curious when he saw the tow truck pull in. He called the mechanic a crook and shooed him away. After taking a look himself, he said my brake master cylinder wasn’t delivering pressure. He and I got in his truck, bought a new cylinder, and had the brakes working perfectly in under an hour.

Ever since then I’ll bring him a beer and shoot the shit when I see him working on the classic corvette he keeps in his garage.

“Oh, everything’s fine. Caroline and I found some things that might relate to an old missing person’s case. To be honest, it’s probably just a prank some kids left. We called just to be safe.”

He stroked his beard, considering. “What kind of things? If,” he held out both hands. “You don’t mind me asking.”

“Well writings of—”

“You see,” he interrupted me. “That fellow that used to live here before you. He was an odd one.”

“It was a woman that lived here when we bought it,” I said confused.

“No. I see why you think so. I believe she would’ve been on the deed. But it was a son of hers or something that lived in this place. Here,” he turned toward the street. “Can I show you something?

“Sure.”

“Actually, it might take me a minute to find it. Come over to my place with Caroline in say…” he looked at his watch. “Fifteen minutes. How’s that work?

“Works fine.”

“Great.”

Greg lived directly across the street from us and when Caroline and I knocked we heard him yell to come in from deeper in the house.

We opened the door and took off our shoes.

“In the dining room,” he leaned back in a chair so he was in view down the hallway and waved.

His place was orderly. It was clean and there were pictures lining the wall of him with a woman and what we presumed to be his children. But we’d never seen him with a wife, nor had he mentioned one. All the pictures of the woman were older and I realized poor Greg was likely a widower.

“Hey guys, sit down. I’ve just about got it here.” He was sitting behind a Hewlett-Packard laptop the size of a small poodle. “I wanted to show this to you before, but I just didn’t know how.”

He spun the computer around. A video player was open on his computer. It was footage from a doorbell camera that looked out directly towards our house.

“Now, I know this’ll sound crazy, but this tape is from summer 2016. Just when you two moved in. I’ve kept it all this time.”

We leaned forward.

“Why do you keep footage this old?” asked Caroline.

Greg said nothing and pointed at the computer as if her question was about to be answered.

In one of the upper bedroom windows of our house, I noticed a man was standing inside at the sill.

“You see the man in the window there?”

We nodded.

“Hit that double arrow thingy. Fast forward a bit.”

I hit fast forward and while the daylight outside faded fast the figure of the man at the window stayed still.

“Keep hittin’ it.”

I pressed it so it was at 16x speed. Hours passed. The man stayed at the window.

“How long does this go on for?”

Greg said nothing, he only nodded down suggesting the footage would again answer our questions for us.

I set the fast forward to as fast as it would go. An entire day passed on film and then, the next day at dawn a moving truck pulled in. Caroline and I stepped out and the man in the window stepped back, disappearing into the house.

“What the fuck?”

“I know. I should’ve showed you earlier,” Greg sighed. “I convinced myself he was a friend of yours or something. It seemed ridiculous. How do you bring that up? Howdy neighbor, nice to meet ya. Here’s a pie, and by the way, check out what my doorbell camera picked up in your upstairs window.”

Caroline and I looked at each other. “How did you notice this?” I asked. “The man in the window how did you know he was there?”

“I noticed him before I saw him on the camera. He was there plain as day. Here,” Greg took the laptop back and clicked a few times and turned it back around.

“You were fast forwarding too quick, but I even tried to wave to him.”

Greg appeared on the footage, he stepped out to the street and waved to the man in the window, but the man didn’t move.

“That didn’t do much good, you see?”

“Well, why was he just standing there?” Caroline asked.

Greg suddenly looked uncomfortable like there was something he didn’t want to say. “Well,” he clicked his tongue against his teeth. “It looks like he was waiting for you.”

\_\_\_

The footage was from too far away to tell if the figure in the window looked anything like Caroline’s stalker, and Greg’s description of the man he had seen living there before wasn’t very helpful either.

The next few days I’d stare out the window towards the woods, wondering if someone else was looking back.

It was late one night when we got the call.

The detective had called Caroline’s cell. She put it on speaker, and we sat together at the kitchen table.

“Hey, sorry to call so late.”

“It’s ok, we’re plenty awake.”

“So, we’re still waiting for DNA results, and again, depending on the circumstances we might not be able to share anything with you.”

“Of course,” said Caroline.

“But the reason I’m calling…. We did get results back for the fingerprints. The thing is,” he paused. “How many people live in your home? Have you had any guest stay for a long period of time recently?”

“No,” said Caroline.

“Ok,” he cleared his throat. “Well, we’ve identified three prominent sets of prints in your home. We’ve identified those of you and your husband but the third set…” Caroline and I looked at each other.

“We can’t find a match in the records. So, I’m calling to ask. Do you have any idea who those fingerprints might [belong to?](https://www.reddit.com/r/thespookyplace/)”

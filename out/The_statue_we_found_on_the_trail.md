The disappearances began shortly after we found it. Over thirty years have passed, but none of the missing were ever found. The memories of that time are still with me every day, and I know they will be there until the day I die. Maybe I'll feel better if I share what happened. I doubt it, but here goes anyway.

It was early October 1991. I was sitting in my room listening to the radio when the doorbell rang. It was Jeff. "Hey Scott, want to go riding through the trails?" he asked.

"Yeah. I'll meet you by the garage," I said.

My mom wasn't home from work, so I left a note on the counter, letting her know I would be out riding my bike.

Jeff and I rode down the street to Jodi's house. Her mom answered the door and said she'd be right out.

Next, we biked over to Kara's house and found her outside shooting hoops. She ran in to tell her parents that we were going to ride around the neighborhood. Then she grabbed her bike, and we headed down the street. Usually, we would also pick up Kyle, but he was on vacation. 

The four of us rode down the street to where the silver metal guard rail and the Dead End sign signaled the end of the road. The grass was worn away on the left side of the rail from all the bikes and shoes that went down the path into the woods. Jodi went first, and then the rest of us followed behind. The trail went on for a long way into the woods. We passed a big area with logs on the ground for seats and a wood pile for bonfires. There were always some empty beer bottles and cigarette butts from the high school kids. Sometimes we'd collect the bottles and return them for a refund so we could buy candy.

Jodi slowed down and then stopped before the path diverged into two separate trails. One led out to the main road, and the other continued into the woods. 

"Where should we go?" asked Jodi. 

"Let's keep going into the woods, and we can stop at the big hill and hang out there for a little while," said Jeff.

"Sounds good," said Kara. 

I nodded in agreement, and we continued on our way.

After riding for a few more minutes, Kara yelled, "Hey everyone, look over there!"

I coasted to a stop, and the others did too. 

"It looks like a circle was cut into the grass," said Kara.

"Let's check it out," said Jeff.

When we got closer, we saw that the grass and weeds surrounding the flat section were normal, but the grass in the middle was matted down and dying.

"Look," said Jodi. "The dead grass makes a perfect circle. Maybe something was left on the grass in that shape?"

The ground was hard and dry within the dead grass. It was about twenty feet in diameter. I heard a very faint noise when we all stepped into the area. 

"Do you hear that?" I asked

"Yes," said Kara. "It sounds like someone is humming."

It was a deep rhythmic noise that got louder when we walked towards the center.

"I think there is something here in the middle," said Jodi. 

There was no grass in the dead center of the circle, and it looked like something was buried in the dirt. Jeff was closest and walked over to it. He dug his hand in the soil and pulled out a small piece of wood. After looking it over, he passed it to Kara. She looked at it for a moment before giving it to Jodi, who then gave it to me. 

It was a small statue that looked hand carved out of wood. The longer I looked at it, the more details seemed to emerge. Two big eyes and a stubby nose were cut into it. It was smiling with pointy teeth crowded into its mouth. I turned it around in my hands, and when I got back to the front of it, I noticed a third eye on its forehead. I didn't see that the first time I looked at it. The legs were bent, and one of its hands was resting on its knees. The other one was held up with four long fingers exposed. Sharp fingernails were carved into each finger. 

"It is really detailed," I said and handed it back to Jeff.

"That's one ugly statue," he said. "It will look perfect on my dresser." 

I felt the ground rumble underneath me and a sudden chill went through my body.

"Did you feel that?" Jodi said. "Probably just my imagination, but it felt like the ground shook a little." 

"I don't think there are earthquakes in Michigan," said Kara, "at least not that you can feel…but I felt something there too."

"So did I," I said.

We returned to our bikes and rode over to the bottom of the hill. When we got to the top, we sat down and hung out for a while. We stayed there until the sun began to set, and then we all went home before it got too dark.   

That night I dreamt of standing in the dead grass with Kara, Jodi, and Jeff. No one moved or said anything. The dream seemed to last a long time and was really boring.

I finally realized it was a dream and that I could control my actions. I noticed a figure standing far in the distance and started walking toward it. But as soon as I stepped out of the dead grass, I woke up. My alarm clock showed that it was two o'clock in the morning. It took me a long time to finally fall back asleep.

At school that day, I was exhausted and had difficulty staying awake. Jodi was in my class, too, and I noticed she was also doing the 'trying to stay awake head nod' just like me.

I went up the hill at recess to play football with my friends. Jeff was there and couldn't stop yawning. He said he got in trouble in the morning for falling asleep during the writing assignment. 

It was tough making it through the rest of the day, and I was glad when it was finally bedtime. I fell asleep almost instantly when my head hit the pillow. Then, it felt like I woke up, except I was standing in the circle of dead grass again. The cool breeze sent goosebumps up and down my arms. I rubbed them and could feel the bumps. Jodi, Jeff, and Kara were in the circle with me again. 

"This is weird," I said. Everything felt so real. I felt the tall grass in my hand and looked at the others. Jodi and Kara were looking at the ground while Jeff was staring into the middle of the dead grass where he had found the statue. I walked closer to the center and noticed the ground was dug up. There was something in there. It looked like some sort of dead animal, but it was covered with dirt, and it was difficult to tell what it was. Maggots were crawling all over it. I gagged and backed away, but the others still weren't moving.

I called out to my friends. "Hey, Jodi. Jeff. Kara. Let's get out of here."

After a minute, Jodi looked up at me. She started moving her arm and then her leg. "I didn't know I could move," she said.

Kara and Jeff seemed to still be frozen in place. Jodi walked to the middle to see what I had been looking at.

"Don't look," I said. "It's disgusting…I think it's a dead animal. It almost made me throw up."

She stopped and looked around instead. "What is that?" she asked, pointing to the giant figure in the distance. Should we try to see what it is?" she asked.

"Okay. Let's go," I said. 

We stayed on the outside edge of the circle to avoid going near the rotting animal. When we stepped out of the dead grass, the dream abruptly ended, and I was awake in my bed. My clock showed two o'clock in the morning once again. This time I was so tired that I fell back asleep right away. I don't remember any of my dreams from my second sleep session.

At school, Jodi told me I was in her dream. She mentioned seeing a giant figure in the distance and waking up after walking out of the dead grass.

I told her I had the same dream, but she didn't believe me until I mentioned the dead animal in the center.

"So…are we sharing the same dream?" she asked.

"Looks like it," I said.

We asked Kara and Jeff about their dreams the last couple of nights. They said they didn't remember them and thought we were crazy when we told them that we were in the same dream.

After school, we met up to ride our bikes and went on the trails again. When we got near the dead grass area, Jodi suddenly stopped.

"Look!" she shouted and pointed past the trees.

I looked where she was pointing but didn't see anything at first. Then I thought I saw a flicker of movement that looked like the figure from my dreams. It went away after I blinked my eyes.

"I think I saw it," I said, "but only for a second or two."

"I didn't see anything," said Jeff.

"Neither did I," said Kara. "Are you two going crazy or just trying to scare us?"

"It was like the thing in our dream," I said.

Kara rolled her eyes. "Let's just go back on our bikes and go to the hill," she said.

Jodi and I stayed back for a minute, continuing to look for the figure. We joined them back at the bikes when we couldn't find it again.

We rode to the hill and hung out there for a while. We talked about Halloween, school, and being excited to attend junior high next year.

When it was getting close to dinner time, we headed back and went our separate ways to go home.

That night I had the same dream again. After Jodi and I started moving, we called Jeff and Kara. Jeff wouldn't look away from the rotting animal in the middle, which began to smell even worse.

Kara finally looked up at us and jumped when she noticed us. "What…how did we get here?" she said as she looked around. "Am I dreaming?"

Jodi smiled. "See…we aren't crazy…well, maybe all of us are crazy. We'll have to see if you remember this tomorrow."

Kara looked around again. "This feels so real," she said. "Is this lucid dreaming? I've heard my older brother and his friends talking about it…they wanted to be able to make out with the hot girls at their school, they said. I thought they were just idiots, thinking they could control their dreams."

"I don't know if we can control this dream," I said. "It feels so real, and we can move around, but I keep thinking of Kelly Kapowski, and she won't appear."

Jodi laughed and then closed her eyes. "Have the New Kids on the Block shown up yet?" she asked before opening her eyes.

"Oh well," I said. "Let's see what we can do. Just don't walk out of the dead grass, or you'll wake up. It happened to me the last two nights. I think it was just last night for Jodi."

"No. It was two nights for me, too," said Jodi. I didn't remember my dream the first night, but I woke up at two o'clock and couldn't fall back asleep.

"That's the same time I woke up both nights," I said.

"Hey, guys. What is that?" Kara asked.

She was looking at the figure in the distance.

"That's what we saw when we were here yesterday," I said. "It was only there for a second. But whatever it is, it just stays there in the dream."

"What should we do?" asked Jodi. "I don't want to wake up at two again, so let's stay in the circle here."

"What's that smell?" asked Kara. She walked towards the middle.

"Wait!" I shouted. "You're not going to want to see that."

"Ewwww, gross!" she said and backed away. "What is that?"

"I think it is an animal," I said. "Jeff won't stop staring at it."

"Let's try to wake him up or whatever you call this," Jodi said, referring to the three of us. 

We all shouted Jeff's name. When he didn't respond, I walked over to him and shook his shoulder. His eyes blinked slowly, and then he turned his head toward me. When we made eye contact, he got startled and stumbled backward. He lost his balance and fell into the tall grass outside our circle. 

I stood there waiting to wake up, but the dream continued. "We didn't wake up," I said.

Jeff stood up and walked toward the center of the circle. "What's that?" he asked. 

I didn't understand why we didn't wake up this time. To test it out, I stepped outside of the circle. A low rumbling growl startled me just as I woke up.

I sat up quickly in bed and thought I could hear the echoing of the growl before it was lost in the silence of the early morning. I looked at my clock. It was 2:12. Well, I guess it was an improvement from the last two nights.

I fell back asleep a little while later but didn't remember my dreams.

At school on Friday, we talked about the dream during recess. Jeff was excited about it. 

"So I guess you guys weren't trying to trick me," he said.

"That was my third night with the same dream," I said. "Did you guys hear the growl before you woke up?'
 
"I didn't," said Jodi.

"Me neither," said Jeff.

"I think I heard something," said Kara. "But I woke up quickly and wasn't sure what it was."

"That was weird how we didn't wake up when Jeff fell outside the circle," I said. "I have an idea to try if we have the dream again tonight."

The bell rang, signaling the end of recess. While we ran to line up to go back inside, I thought someone was watching us. It felt like something was right behind me, staring at the back of my head. Each time I turned around, there was nothing there. 

Back in class, I had that same feeling. I was sure someone was staring through the window. But just like outside, when I looked, no one was there.

I felt uneasy the rest of the day and was nervous about falling asleep. When I turned out the lights, the shadows shimmied and swayed while I quickly ran and jumped into my bed. I thought for sure something was going to grab me before I made it safely under the covers of my bed.

It took me a while to fall asleep. When I finally did, I found myself in the familiar circle of dead grass. This time, everyone else was moving around. 

"Oh good, you're finally here," Jodi said to me. "What took you so long?"

"I had trouble falling asleep," I said. 

The others were looking at the tall grass around our circle. 

Jodi looked at me and said, "What was the idea you had that you were talking about at recess?"

"Nothing happened when Jeff fell out of the circle, but we woke up after he went back in, and I stepped out," I said.

Jeff looked confused. "What do you mean?" he asked.

"Why don't you try walking out of the circle first," I said.

Jeff took a few small steps into the tall grass. 

"We're still here," I said. "Okay, now stay there, and let's see what happens when we walk out."

The rest of us walked over to Jeff. When we stepped out of the circle, nothing happened. 

"It worked!" shouted Jodi.

We walked all the way to the dirt path we would ride our bikes on. It was weird how everything felt so still and quiet. There was no wind, but I could feel the air on my skin. The sun was out in the middle of the sky, and it felt warmer than it should have for October.

We continued our walk on the path and found our bikes lying in the grass. 

"Sweet, our bikes are here," said Jeff.

We hopped on them and rode to the bottom of the big hill.

"Is it getting darker out?" asked Kara.

The sun was now only about forty-five degrees from the horizon. It had moved fast once we left the circle.

"Looks like it," said Jodi.

As we walked up the hill, the sun went lower and lower. It was setting behind the tree once we reached the top. The sky was tinged with purple and pink, but it didn't look beautiful like a typical sunset. It felt like something terrible was going to happen, and the world around us looked ominous. It wasn't just me that felt that way.

"Why does the sky look so wrong?" asked Jodi. 

The sun didn't seem to be moving anymore. The woods behind us were shrouded in shadows, and the trees were moving even though there wasn't any wind.

The low rumbling growl I heard last night broke the silence and filled our ears. We could see a long way from the top of the hill. I looked at the figure I had seen before, which I was sure was the source of the sound. It was still far away, but I could tell it had gotten closer. 

"What was that?" asked Jeff.

"That's the noise I heard yesterday," I said. I looked at the figure again, and it was noticeably closer. "I think that thing is coming after us."

It was moving fast, and the sun was disappearing quickly. Soon we were plunged into the darkness and couldn't see it anymore. But we could hear it tearing through the trees and bushes.

"How do we wake up?" asked Jeff.

"Maybe we go back to the circle," I said. 

We ran down the hill and climbed onto our bikes. As we were riding, the chain on my bike snapped, and I fell hard to the ground, knocking the wind out of me. The others didn't see me fall and kept on going. They were out of sight before I could manage to shout to them.

The growling continued, and I could hear the thing running toward me. I struggled to stand back up. The trees shook, and I saw some get knocked over as it got closer. I started running but stumbled and fell. My foot was throbbing in pain.

The thing emerged onto the trail and stopped a few feet from me. It stood about eight feet tall. Its hair looked like dead vines. The legs were like tree trunks, and the arms hung like gnarled branches from an old tree. Its mouth was open, showing the long thorn-like teeth. Its fingernails were like sticks carved into a spear. Its two big eyes were black and hollow.

I started backing up when I saw the eye on its forehead open. It was cloudy, and I couldn't pull my eyes from it. It felt like it was looking deep into my mind. I started thinking about my trip to Disney World with my family a few years ago. The vivid details of the memory flooded my mind, and it felt like I was there again, like a dream within a dream. 

I was on the rides again, meeting the characters and having fun with my mom and dad. This was our last vacation before my dad passed away, so it was an extra special memory.

Then I felt a hand on my shoulder shaking me. 

"Scott! Get up!" shouted Jodi.

"Oh my god, that's the statue!" shouted Jeff.

My friends helped me up, and we ran back as fast as we could back to the circle. I could hear the monster following closely behind us, and I could feel it looking at me. It took everything I had to not turn around and look at it.

Finally, we made it to the dead grass and huddled together on the ground. The monster got closer but stopped just before the dead grass started. Then it backed up a few steps, still watching us. It opened its third eye again, but it was easier to look away this time. 

"Don't look at it!" I shouted.

We all sat close and looked at each other, waiting and hoping to wake up.

After a while, I thought I heard a car alarm in the distance and started looking around. "Do you hear that?" I asked.

The others looked puzzled and shook their heads. I started to tell them what it sounded like when, all of a sudden, I found myself in my bed with my morning alarm loudly beeping next to me.

I tried to think of my Disney trip but couldn't remember any of the rides I went on or the characters I met. The plane ride and the hotel were still in my memory, but it was fuzzy when I tried to picture what we did.

Saturday afternoon, we met at Jeff's house. His aunt and uncle, and older cousin were visiting for the weekend.

"I can't remember my Disney trip from second grade anymore," I said.

"What are you talking about?" asked Jodi

"Last night, when that thing was staring at me with that big eye on its forehead, I started thinking about that trip…but when I woke up, I could barely remember any of the trip," I said.

"That wasn't that long ago. How could you not remember it?" Kara asked.

"I think it took my memory. I don't know how else to explain it. It felt like that eye was digging inside my mind. Did you guys feel anything like that?" I asked.

Jodi and Jeff shook their heads no, but Kara nodded.

"I felt something like you were saying…like it was digging into my mind. I don't remember thinking of anything special other than being really scared of that thing," said Kara.

That night we were all in the circle again. 

"Where is the monster?" asked Jodi. "I don't see it where it was before." 

"I don't see it either," I said.

A piercing scream echoed across our dream world. It was coming from our neighborhood.

"That must be my cousin," said Jeff. "I was afraid he'd be here with us."

"Why would he be here?" asked Jodi.

"I told him about the statue. He said it was just a stupid statue and thought I was lying about the dreams," said Jeff. "Then he took it off my dresser and threw it in my closet."

"Then why isn't he in the ring here with us?" asked Kara.

"I don't know," said Jeff. "But we need to get him and bring him here where it is safe."

Jeff led the way out of the dead grass to the dirt trail. Our bikes were lying on the ground like before. I checked mine, and the chain looked normal. We rode quickly to the neighborhood and looked around for the monster while we went.

When we got to Jeff's street, we stopped. The monster was standing in the front yard with its back to us. A boy was standing unmoving in front of it.

"That's Brian," said Jeff.

We stood and waited, afraid of trying to help. Finally, Jeff rode his bike toward his house.

"Jeff, wait!" said Kara.

We watched Jeff ride right up to the monster and start yelling at it. Then, it turned around with all three eyes opened and stepped closer, towering over him. 

"Go away!" Jeff yelled. 

The monster's third eye closed, and the rest of us stood in disbelief as it turned around and walked away. We rode over to Jeff and Brian when it had retreated a good distance.

Jeff was talking to him, but Brian didn't say anything and just stared blankly ahead. We watched as his face and chest began to cave in. It was like his face had been sucked in by a vacuum. Then he collapsed to the ground and crumbled into a pile of dust.

There wasn't anything else we could do, so we rode back to the dead grass. I looked back and saw the monster following us.

"It is coming back!" I shouted. 

We sped up and jumped off our bikes once we were near the dead grass. I felt the urge to stop and turn around before I made it inside the circle. I noticed that Kara and Jodi also stopped.

I kept my back to it at first, but I could feel that eye penetrating my skull. 

"We need to wake up," I said as I began to turn around. I couldn't stop myself from looking in the eye. It was mesmerizing.  

I started thinking about when my mom and I moved into the house in this neighborhood after my dad died. I was helping bring things inside the house.

Then I felt someone grab onto me and pull me to the ground. It was Jeff. 

"I was shouting at you, but you wouldn't respond," he said.

I looked at Kara, and now she was staring at the monster. Jeff ran over to her and shook her shoulders, standing between her and the thing. 

"What happened?" she asked. "I was thinking about when I first got my puppy.

"Wake up!" Jeff yelled.

Suddenly I was sitting up in my bed. It was an hour before my alarm would go off, but I wasn't going back to sleep.

I had to go apple picking with my mom that day. Usually, I would have liked it, but I was anxious to see my friends after that dream. Although, it was nice to be distracted for a while, and the cinnamon apple donuts were delicious. 

When I got back home, I grabbed my bike and went to Jodi's house. 

"Did you hear about Brian?" she asked me when she answered the door.

"No…what happened?" I said.

"He's gone. They can't find him anywhere."

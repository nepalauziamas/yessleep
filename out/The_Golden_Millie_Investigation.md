As I breathed heavily, hiding around the corner not knowing how long I have till it found me. Peeking around the corner, I saw it, it bloodshot eyes that pierce into your soul with one glance. It's thin pale white body crouched over trying to find something- my scent. I knew it was too good to be true, I should have trusted my gut instinct. Going on this crazy treasure hunt and now I am the only surviving member. It was
looking for me, I shouldn't have taken its prized
possession, the statue of "The Golden Millie", a scared artifact, made of pure gold, if only I wasn't so adventurous, greedy, I might have never had to face this situation. The creature all of a sudden made a blood curdling scream and ran off in the opposite direction. This was my chance, I had to run for it, escape this hell hole. I sprinted to the room across from my position, but as I entered it, I realized I made a grave mistake… I had entered its nest.

As I’m laying back on my couch watching the news, I get a notification on my phone. I pick up the phone to see who it is and see it’s my research assistant Mark. To give some background, I am a head researcher of an organization dedicated to finding lost treasures, a sort of “Indiana Jones” type of person. Mark looks for missing artifacts that have been described in ancient scrolls and then sends them to me if he finds any interesting ones. 

Anyways, as I look down I see that Mark seems pretty urgent about this one. It’s a lost sculpture that’s made of pure gold, with ruby eyes and looks fairly similar to a bearded dragon. It was found in an ancient manuscript dated back to 35 AD, which it was titled as “The Golden Millie”. I message mark back right away telling him to start packing we’re going on an adventure. I will not disclose the location of the treasure as I don’t want any one else suffering the same fate as I have. Mark, a few fellow researchers and I a few days later land near the site of “The Golden Millie” and immediately start are investigation. This prevails as only days into the search one of the researchers finds a strange monument protruding from the ground. As we all crowd around to admire the discovery, the ground beneath us cracks and falls right beneath us and our whole team falls into the dark pit. 

Once we come to our senses we realize that we are stuck here, with no way to get out unless we find an exit. We decide not to split up but to stick together just in case one of us were to find the exit. As we are about 30 minutes into the exploration, as deafening scream rings out through the abandoned halls, That is when we realize we have awoken something, someone. (If this gets enough support I will continue the story, this is my first story so sorry if it’s a bit rugged)

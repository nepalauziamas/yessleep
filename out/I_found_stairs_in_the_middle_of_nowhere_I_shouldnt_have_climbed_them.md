Hello everyone, my name is Luke and I'm posting this to hopefully get some help, or at least some knowledge about what's happening or how I should deal with this nightmare. 


It all began a few days ago, when I was taking a stroll through the woods behind my house. No, I don't live in the middle of nowhere like a neanderthal, but in a small, quiet neighborhood just outside the big city. The woods are also pretty safe, as the area I live in has more insects than mammals. I don't usually take these strolls as forests creeped me out ever since I was little, but sometimes I need to clear my head, this was one of those days. 


After having the most boring and tiring night shift, I slept until early noon and I only woke up because my phone made a *ping* noise, letting me know I had a notification. Having an unfair fight with my eyelids I barely managed to open them enough to read the text. It was from my girlfriend. The text, more like a whole paragraph, basically said she needed some time to herself and that we should take a break. Of course she added the classic "it's not you, it's me", I knew what this meant, most likely a break up. 


I texted her back, supporting her even though my heart ached as a heavy flow of memories of us hit me like a truck. I got out of bed, my mood killing the need for sleep, and ate some leftovers from yesterday. I was trying to keep myself occupied so as to not think about the only person in the world that kept me sane, now breaking up with me. I remembered the woods behind my house, and the trail that led in the forest. 


Against my better judgement, I decided to take a stroll through the woods, to clear my head and let nature calm me down. I put on a pair of black jeans, a white t-shirt, a black zip up hoodie and my beat up Air Force 1s before leaving the house and heading towards the trail


I started down the trail, I was pretty familiar with the forest, as I've taken a few more walks beforehand so I wasn't worried about getting lost. The weather was clear, as the bright, yellow bulb shined its blinding light through the sea-like sky, it was unusually hot for autumn. Leaves were starting to fall, seeing them in their different decaying stages, some green, freshly fallen, other yellow or brown, forming the colorful crunchy carpet that I was walking on. Adding to this, the fresh air and slight breeze hitting my skin was refreshing. The birds were chirping while sitting on different branches, I even saw a squirrel climb into their winter shelter. 


I checked my watch, 2 p.m. I was getting pretty close to the point of the trail I usually stopped at before turning around to go back to my house, but this time, I decided to go in further, *I'll walk until 3 p.m then I'll turn back*  is what I said to myself, not knowing that this single decision would change my life forever.


I walked around 15 more minutes before I noticed something strange…the silence. What I mean by that isn't the peacefulness of the forest with its occasional sounds, no, I mean complete and utter silence. There were no birds, no leaves hushing around in the gust of the gentle wind, nothing. I stopped dead in my steps, a cold chill running down my spine. A sudden, uncontrollable panic settled in as I looked around rapidly. My eyes were rapidly dancing on my surroundings before they landed on something…something that didn't make the situation any better. In the middle of the trees, around 15 feet or so from the trail were stairs. 


Yes, what looked like a flight of stairs taken out of an office building were sitting, ridiculously, in front of me, in the middle of the forest. About 10 concrete stairs along with a steel guardrail, looking brand new as if they've just been copy pasted there, went up to…nothing, at the top of the stairs was nothing. I checked my watch to look at the time but…instead of the blue, digital numbers, there were lines and dots, as if the watch broke out of nowhere."Dammit" I said, my panicky state getting worse. 


I had to calm down, I had to think rationally so I did the only thing reasonable at that time, I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, hoping that when I’d open them again everything would be back to normal, I was now the moron of every horror movie. I should've turned 180° and bolted down the way I came. 


After some seconds went by I opened my eyes again, calmer and full of hope. But as soon as my vision came back, the flight of stairs did as well. *Well, that's not making this better* I mumbled to myself. My mind instinctively rushed to try and make sense of why they were there, an old house maybe? But it couldn't be, the stairs looked brand new and the ground around them looked normal, undisturbed. Trying to make sense of the situation didn't help at all, and the sun was beginning to go the other way, signaling it was going to be afternoon in an hour or so. 


Before I spun around to leave, something about them made me want to get closer, to analyze. I don't know how to describe the feeling, something within me just wanted to get closer, I couldn't resist. 


As soon as I was next to them everything felt weird…the air felt heavier, the silence got morbidly worse, I couldn't even hear my own pulse. My panicky state suddenly went away, an unusual calmness overcoming it. I analyzed them like a crazy architect, looking behind them, at their corners, every bit of surface they had was looked over. If anyone were to be on the trail at that moment they would've thought I was insane. 


Then, out of nowhere, I made the worst decision of my life, I climbed them. As soon as I got to the top, everything went dark, like the sun exploded and the world transformed into an eternal void. I woke up hours later, because when I opened my eyes the sun was almost set, the moon slowly appearing over the horizon. I was sweaty, sitting on the cold forest floor, the stairs nowhere to be found. I looked around, confused, *did I dream it all?* the voice in my head asked me. It couldn't have been a dream, it seemed too real, and why would I even decide to take a nap just off the trail? Nothing made sense, nothing would make sense anymore. 


I got up, dusted myself off and slowly began to walk back to my house. I got back to town, it was colder now, it was noon. The lights on the street lamps were shining a bright, mustard yellow light, illuminating the sidewalk and a little bit of the street as well. The night sky was just as clear as it was during the day, it was littered with tiny, sparkly stars though, making it look like a beautifully painted canvas. 


I got back to my house and strangely, the lights were on. *Huh* I muttered to myself, a little confused. I was just about to put the keys in the lock, before I saw the handle being pressed. I snapped back and hid behind one of my garden bushes, so I wouldn't be seen. 


Who, I mean, what came out of the house was impossible…it was me. I was walking out of my house, but I was already outside. My head started to hurt, my mind was spinning, it didn't make sense. How could there be another me? It couldn't have been possible, but there I was, walking out with a smile on my face, heading for my car after I locked the door. I got a glimpse of my face, it looked the same as mine, but there was something…off, I couldn't pinpoint what, but something was definitely off about it. My second self got in my car and left, as soon as my second self left I went into my house, with no hesitation. 


It was still the same as I had left it, but the atmosphere felt wrong. I looked around, checking if any furniture was moved, if anything was missing, but everything was in its place. I even checked if the firehook next to the fireplace was missing, it wasn't. Then I looked at the photos of myself and everything started to spin again. I picked up one of the small wood frames to take a closer look, it was me, smiling next to my dog who died seven years ago. The dog was fine, but my smile…it seemed fake, it looked fake. To anyone else, the difference would be impossible to spot, but to me, it was clear as day. 


I don't know for how long I looked at the photo before I heard the keys clicking in the door. Me, the thing was back, I put the framed photograph back and went in to hide. As soon as *it* walked in the house the air got heavy again, like it did when I went next to the stairs. The footsteps stopped suddenly, the tension was crushing me, I closed my eyes, repeating in my mind that this couldn't be real, then, I heard it speak. 


"Come out, Luke. I know you're here"


I opened my eyes, frozen in place, my heart pounding out of my chest. How did it know I'm here? Did it see me? No, it didn't, I was hidden from the windows and the door. Then it clicked, I left the door unlocked after my double locked it. *Fuck I'm stupid* I said to myself. 


It spoke again. "Are you going to make this easy or are you going to make me come get you?" It said with a cold chuckle. 


I couldn't run, it would spot me and God knew what I was dealing with, so I did the only thing I could've in that situation, I slowly forced my body up to face it. 


"There you are." It said with a creepy smile, spread  across its face. 


I couldn't say anything, how could I? Myself was talking to me, eyes to eyes, my own world was crumbling upon me. 


"I know this is weird to you, but you did it yourself Luke, all because you're a curious moron." It said, its smile now fading away. 


"How?" I finally managed to mutter, out of all the things I could've said, I settled on "How", great. 


"Are you serious? Don't you remember climbing those stairs?" The thing spoke, keeping an eye on me. 


*So I wasn't dreaming* I thought, feeling the blood flow through me, I couldn't move, I barely managed to stay on my feet, I felt dizzy. 


"Now, your past, present and future is mine." The double me said, starting to laugh, "And I'll make sure you won't mess anything up." It continued and before I knew it I was getting tackled, the thing was on top of me, pinning me to the ground.


Its hands now transformed from normal human hands to sharp, hairy claws. Its eyes went from looking like my emerald green color to a crazed red, like the creature hadn't slept in days. Its nose now looked more like it belonged to a dog or deer. The body began to twitch unnaturally all the while worms were crawling in its dark hair.. Some even got on my face, making me yelp instinctively. I also found out why the air was so heavy around it, the stench oozing from its body almost made me throw up. It smelled like rotten corpses, like death. 


Before I knew it, what I can only guess were my primal instincts kicked in, fueled by adrenaline and panic. I grabbed the creature by the neck, it laughed. 


"Do you think you can choke me out Luke? You're dead." It grinned, its teeth now yellow with two, sharp fangs at the edges of its mouth. 


My hands came down, trying to punch the thing away, but I couldn't reach it. It started choking me, I looked around for a smidget of hope, knowing my life was about to end, I saw we were close to the fireplace, and I also saw the fire hook. It looked reachable. The thing was too busy trying to kill me to see I was trying to get my only hope. I was about to give up before my fingers touched it. I was feeling the claws starting to get under my skin, as the thing started to choke me harder. 


I finally fully gripped the hook, hitting it with all the power I had left straight in the head. The creature shrieked as it stumbled back. In my rush of adrenaline I got up, taking deep breaths as I felt blood dripping from my neck while air flowed through my body again. As fast as the thing stumbled back, it charged again, but this time it didn't manage to get me, as I pointed the sharp end of the hook at it, impaling in its arm. 


The creature fell to the ground, dropping my car keys from its pocket. I saw them and made a run for it, I took the keys and rushed out of my house. I shakily but quickly unlocked my car. I got in, started the car and backed out of my driveway. Then I floored it down the road, behind me, I heard something grab the trunk just before I managed to get away, it was the creature. But it didn't manage to fully grab it so the thing lost its grip. I got away, I kept driving and I didn't stop until I was out of town. 


I'm now stopped at a hotel, but I'm planning to get on the road again. I don't know what to do, I'm still shaken and terrified for my life, for my existence. I tried calling my friends, my family, but all of them thought I was joking. Even tried 911 but they didn't believe me either. They said that prank calling the emergency line can be a fineable offense and to not do it again. Nobody believed me, that's another reason why I came here, to hopefully find someone that understands what is happening and maybe help me. If no one has experienced this, all I can tell you, no matter how much, how tempted you are, never approach stairs you see in the middle of the woods, or anywhere they aren't supposed to be.

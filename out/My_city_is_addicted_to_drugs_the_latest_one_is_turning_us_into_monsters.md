Emberstone is a city in a place you probably never even heard of it. A city that is prosperous despite it being unknown by a majority of the world. Sitting at a population of about 2.1 million we are surrounded by mostly farmlands outside of our concrete jungle. I'd prefer the farmlands but got stuck here because farmers get paid jack shit compared to being a businessman in the city. This city has its own problems, everyone's addicted to drugs. Just like the latest video trends or clothing trends there seems to be a new drug pumped out every single month. When that new drug hits the market, it becomes unresistable and nobody, the rich or the poor can escape from wanting that puff. 

Drugs have been universalized in a little box; guess you could compare it to a vape. Practically everyone in this damn city has one, and everybody's got to get their hourly puff, or they feel like their face will melt off. All these damn drugs also have the stupidest code names, like Black Ice or Phoenix Breath. I'm one of the few people in Emberstone that doesn't carry around a puffer. You'd think it would be the opposite when you are walking down the street and you get dirty looks for doing drugs but now it's the other way around. You get chastised and ridiculed for not killing yourself, fucking crazy right?

I was fine avoiding the crazies until the latest drug hit the market, experimental apparently. Not even safe in the slightest but what does the majority of the population do? They buy it up like its candy sold by the pound. This new drug has probably the stupidest name out of all of them, Spike, that's it, that's the whole name. Everybody was gushing over this damn drug, gave you the best high with the best after feeling where you didn't feel like a pile of walking shit. It sold more than the last 3 drugs combined. They sold so much the damn factory couldn't keep up production and people began demanding for more.

Then the first transformation happened. Jeremy Wagner, buddy of mine from high school who works at the same office I do started to act weird. He was such a calm dude, never freaked out and handled the worst situations with the most calmness I'd ever seen. He started to go paranoid, began demanding that everyone reveal who they truly are. Blood began to run from his eyes and an inhuman scream emitted from his throat. Security tackled him and attempted to restrain him but suddenly Jeremy, a scrawny dude, was able to push away 2 muscular security guards. His skin began to ooze into a disgusting gray and green. The worst part? The fucking spikes, black spikes began protruding from his body. The security guards made the best choice they could, and splattered his brains across the people spectating.

Arkhavis, the company I work at, tried to cover it up, and so did the local government. They refused to give the public any information on what happened with Jeremy, and his family got no answers outside what I could try to explain to them. Unfortunately, the government didn't get much calm time as they had hoped. The second case broke out at a fast food joint, then the next in a hospital. This illness spread like a wildfire and the government immediately set out to discover this new virus. 

You can bet the drug industry took a plummet when they discovered it was Spike doing it. Anyone who took over 10 puffs became this seething creature that we now call the Spiked. Mindless monsters who's only goal is to get more of the drug. But how can a creature obtain something that is no longer in production? Well, if you even took one puff of that drug it's dormant in your system. In your blood. These creatures found this out when they started to kill off the unturned. 98% of our city was a feeding ground for the Spiked, because everybody took a goddamn puff of that drug.

People who took less than the 10 puffs were fine but were now the targets of possible friends or family that were just fine days ago. The apocalypse had begun and here I was, the man who never touched a drug in his life, stuck in this shit with all these idiots. Well, now the outside world has some sort of idea of the hell Emberstone is in.

Whoever's out there, I'll be logging the next few weeks or however long I survive this crap. I'm not safe because these creatures don't care if you have the Spike in you or not, they won't know till they crack you open and eat you till there's nothing left. I heard some radio chatter about a survivor down south towards the poorer side of the city.

Until then, Tom out.

The backdoor was unlocked. I followed Thiago and Jasmine inside. The two brothers--Ariel and Ferdinand--were ten and seven, still young enough that they shared a room. I had never been in this house before, only stood outside chatting with the family a couple of times. We didn't know where the parents were, but we found the boys' room easily enough. There was a bunk bed and posters of famous people on the walls. Ferdinand was pressed up against the wall looking petrified. His older brother lay on the floor, struggling to pry a sentient blob of meat off his face. It covered his mouth and nose so that he could not breathe. Watching an adult go through that would be bad enough, but he was ten years old.

Thiago, Jasmine and I all rushed inside and formed a circle around Ferdinand. We knelt and tried to pry the meat off with our hands. It slipped through our fingers like it was a liquid. "Move," said Greta. She approached with the cooler. Ferdinand's arms started to flap like he was underwater and trying to get to the surface. I know what that means. It's the last thing that happens to a drowning victim before they die, an involuntary reaction that the body performs as a last-ditch effort to find air. The meat wasn't suffocating Ferdinand, it was drowning him.

Greta emptied the contents of the cooler over Ferdinand's face. The meat stopped pulsing and went limp, sliding off of his face. Ferdinand's arms stopped flapping. His brother came to life, pushing past us and kneeling next to him. He opened Ariel's mouth. I think he was about to perform CPR, but then Ferdinand coughed and spat out another blob of meat. It landed on the ice cubes laying next to his body.

"Nando," said Ariel.

"Don't. Call. Me. That," said Ferdinand, barely able to get the words out between coughs and sputters.

"I don't think it's water," I said, looking at Greta. "I think it's cold. If heat activates them, then the cold shuts them down."

"We should get those into the freezer," said Jasmine, looking at the two blobs next to Ferdinand.

"How do we kill it?" said Thiago. Eli appeared at the bedroom door, carrying a Glock.

"Where are your parents?" I asked the kids. If the parents came home right now and found a bunch of adults in their kids' bedroom, one of whom was carrying a gun, they might get the wrong idea.

"Mom's at her friend's," said Ariel. "She left Dad to watch us. He said he had to go to the store and he'd be right back."

"He didn't take you with him?" asked Thiago.

"He said he just needed to get some stuff for dinner," said Ariel. "We were playing video games. Then a window broke and Nando--"

"Ferdinand," said Ferdinand.

"Sorry, Ferdinand," Ariel sounded the name out like he'd never heard it before. Usually, it's the older brother who pushes the younger one around, but Ariel had found a very simple way to mess with his big brother. It was kind of funny. "So Ferdinand went to find out what it was. I waited for a minute, but then I came and found him like this."

"Are you okay?" I asked Ferdinand. He nodded. His face was no longer blue and he pushed himself up so that he could sit with his back against the bunk bed. Jasmine and Thiago were trying to scoop the blobs of meat into the cooler with their hands. It was a little awkward but they were managing. Greta and Eli were having some whispered conversation at the door. I think she was trying to convince him to lose the gun.

"Guys," I said. "Where's Aiden?"

Everyone froze. For a second the only sound at all was Ferdinand's breathing. Greta and Eli looked back down the hall toward the backdoor. "He was with us a minute ago," she said.

"He could be somewhere else in the house," I said.

"Why?" said Thiago.

"Greta," said Jasmine. "Is there something you're not telling us?"

Greta glared at her. The two brothers looked confused, like I did when I was a child and the adults would start to talk about something a little too mature for my understanding, but forgot that I was still in the room.

"If something's wrong with him, you can't hold back on us," I said. "Anything you can tell us, where he is, what's going--"

"He's been weird lately," she said. "Ever since he ate the bad meat. He sleeps funny, with his knees pulled up to his chest. He takes way too long in the bathroom every morning. And he eats really slowly."

"Is that all?" I asked.

"No," she said. "He lost his job. Said the company was losing money, so they had to lay him off, but I didn't believe him." Neither Greta nor Aiden had mentioned this to me. Judging by the looks on the other adult's faces, they hadn't told them either.

"What's laying off?" said Ariel.

"It means getting fired," I said.

"Because he was bad at his job," said Ariel.

"Aiden wasn't bad at his job," said Greta, a little more sharply than she should have. "He just--I don't want to talk about it. I want to find him and make it so this doesn't happen again. Where the f--where would he go?"

"Mom and Dad's bedroom is upstairs," said Ferdinand. "It's where Mom keeps her jewelry. I think Dad has some cash hidden up there."

"He's not trying to rob you guys," said Greta. "Why would you think that?" She had barely finished saying it when something heavy hit the floor above us. Everyone looked up.

"Where are the stairs?" said Eli. Ariel darted off to show them. Eli and Greta followed.

"We're just gonna get some ice from your freezer," said Jasmine. "To make sure the meat doesn't...doesn't try to hurt you again."

"It's okay," said Ferdinand. "Kitchen's that way." He jerked his head to the hall outside his bedroom door.

Thiago and Jasmine went to get the ice. I sat down on the floor facing Ferdinand. He was looking better physically, but there was something in his eyes that concerned me. I almost died once as a child. It's a long story. What I remember most is the cold realization that death is real. I had attended the funerals of a few extended family members, but it wasn't until I came face to face with my own mortality that it sunk in for me that I wouldn't just bounce back up like Wile E. Coyote every time he fell off a cliff. If a truck hit me or I got some terminal disease, I would die. That would be it.

Ferdinand met my eyes. He didn't say anything. I wondered when his father would be home. How would we explain what happened to him? Even if we didn't tell him about the meat, he would still want to know what broke the window to his sons' bedroom. After what seemed like an eternity but was probably just a minute or two, Ferdinand spoke.

"Thank you," he said.

"For what?" I said.

"For being with me," he said. "They don't listen to me."

"Your parents."

"Yeah," he said. "I mean, my dad does sometimes, but my mom...I think something's wrong with them. They're always staying in their room and we can hear loud talking. They're trying to keep their voices down, but me and my brother can still hear them."

"And your brother?" I said. "Does he listen to you?"

"Yes," said Ferdinand. "Except when I tell him my name."

"You don't like being called 'Nando'?" I asked.

"It sounds girly," he said.

'Well, I don't know about that," I said. "But whatever you want to be called, it's what they should call you."

"Can I ask you something?" he asked me.

"Sure."

"You have kids?"

"No," I said. "I'm getting married next year. My  fianc√©e and I, we've talked. I think she wants them, too."

"So you're gonna have them?"

"Why do you ask?"

"Because you're good," Ferdinand said. "My brother likes you."

"How can you tell?"

"Because he looks you in the eye."

It had been a long time since everyone had gone upstairs. If Aiden was up there, I should go find out what it was. I thought about telling Ferdinand to wait here, but that just seemed wrong. So I asked him if he wanted to come with me and he said yes. It's so weird to think that there are people living right now who don't remember landlines.

Ferdinand showed me to the stairs. Thiago and Jasmine stood at the foot. Something was going on upstairs. I could hear raised voices but not make out any words. "What's going on?" I asked them.

"Aiden's up there," said Thiago.

"Is he okay?" I asked. "Why are you down here?"

The voices were getting louder. I could hear Greta. Her voice cut through everyone else's. She said something and a voice I didn't recognize answered. Then Eli said something. Ariel said something as well but I still couldn't make out the words, only tell that he sounded alarmed. The unfamiliar voice said something back. Eli said something very angry. Greta sounded more afraid than ever before. The gun went off. Gunshots are loud. Especially indoors.

There was the sound of a scuffle. I was about to race upstairs when a body tumbled down the stairs. It was Eli. His limbs were bent the wrong way and he bounced down the stairs as if he had been thrown. He came to rest at the foot of the stairs. His handgun had been lodged into his mouth so forcefully that I think it broke his jaw. His eyes were open but they were unfocused and his head was turned almost all the way around on his neck. Without even checking for a pulse, I knew he was dead.

Aiden appeared at the top of the stairs. Except it didn't really look like him. His face had become red and splotchy. Giant pustules covered his whole body. His stomach appeared distended. He had removed his shoes and socks because his feet were now far too big for them, looking more like flippers. He smiled at us and started down the stairs. I could just see Greta, Jasmine, and Ariel watching from the top of the stairs. Somehow Ariel looked the least frightened of the three of them. The meat had done something to Aiden. I didn't know if my friend was still in there.

I heard a car pull into the driveway. Ariel and Ferdinand's father was home. In a way, that was a relief. It meant that explaining to him why his window was broken and a bunch of strange adults were in his house was now the least of our problems. But I still had no idea what to do about Aiden. So I pushed past Thiago and Jasmine and stood at the foot of the stairs, just behind Eli's body. Aiden stopped a few feet away and stared at me. I think he wanted to see if I was going to do anything. Ferdinand came closer and stood next to me. I decided that I was going to try to save Aiden, if the meat hadn't corrupted him entirely. There had been enough death today [already](https://www.reddit.com/user/_Cu_Chulainn17).

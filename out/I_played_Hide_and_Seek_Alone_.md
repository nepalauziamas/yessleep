And it went great, because I took all the necessary precautions. 

If you guys don't know what I'm referring to, its a japanese ritual known as "Hide and Seek Alone" a.k.a Hitori Kakurenbo. You can go ahead and look up the rules.

I used a dragon plush I got from an ex-boyfriend that I didn't want anymore. Apart from the rice and a fingernail, I also stuffed him with flowers in hopes to attract a well-intentioned spirit. (Spoiler alert - it worked) I am a very positive person, so I filled him up with good energies. I even used a black marker to write "good boy" on him, because as you might know, the colour black has protective properties. I started feeling his presence the moment I gave him a name and referred to him with it.

To prepare for the game, I hid all the knives in my room, and I also salted the kitchen so that the doll didn't have access to anything sharp, like forks. It was 3.30 PM when I started the game (I'm afraid of the dark, don't judge me, lol) and I played my favourite music as background music, because static would creep me out. 

Before I started the game, I let the doll know I would stab him gently , to which he responded by suddenly having a little hole appear in the middle of his hand! I took pics of him beforehand, in which you can clearly see there was no hole in his hand just 20 minutes ago. Its like he was saying "It won't hurt me much if you stab me in this hole I just created."

I placed him gently in the middle of the bath tub, declared myself the "devil" , and quickly left the bathroom. I shut the door behind me. I waited for 10 seconds in my room, before heading back to the bathroom to stab him. **The door was wide open. That's how I knew for sure this game was real.** I said "I found you , (doll name) !" 3 times, and stabbed his little hand. The moment I stabbed his hand, I felt an incredible sense of fear wash over me, like something really bad was about to happen, despite the atmosphere being lighthearted before that. I wanted to stay and look at him for a little more, but **all my instincts told me to run.** I went to my hiding spot. With each passing second, the atmosphere kept getting more and more uncomfortable for me. **I also want to mention that I never get headaches, but the more the game progressed, the more my head started feeling heavy and like something was wrong.** I decided I wanted to end the game quickly, after just over a minute of playing. I took the salt water in my mouth and headed to the bathroom. Lo and behold, the doll had moved. I wasted no more time, cause that would be absolutely STUPID now that I was sure he was sentient, and I poured the water on him, ending the game. I cut the red cord to release the spirit, which despite not giving off any bad energies, was still a powerful spirit that I did not want to keep trapped. 

As I went to burn it, I realised something awful about the rules of this game. **No one ever fucking tells you that you can't burn the wet doll.** I atleast burned its insides, just to ensure that the spirit leaves it for good, and I'm currently waiting for it to dry so I can burn it completely. Ants are crawling all over it. There was definitely a presence in him, that went away once I severed the red cord and burned up the insides. 

Anyway, that was my authentic experience with the game. Nothing too scary, but I'd like to assure you guys that this game is very, very , very real. :)

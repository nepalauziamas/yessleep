Like most teenagers, I really looked forward to college. Not having to be home by any time, eating whatever I wanted, and finding time to learn some stuff in between all of the socializing. It took a little time to get used to the coed bathrooms, but not much. My first month there, I went to the bathroom one night and found that someone had smeared shit all over the floor of a stall. Were they really drunk and missed the toilet? I don't think I want to know the answer to that one.

My roommate was normal. That's out of the ordinary for me. Just a communications major who went home every few weekends and went to bed before 11 every night. It was the people down the hall who really rubbed me the wrong way. They smoked a lot of weed, and didn't know that you're supposed to roll up towels and stuff them under the crack in the door. But the R.A. was a stoner herself, so maybe she just didn't care.

One night when my roommate was away, I was awoken by loud chatter outside my door. A couple of people had come to the building just to stare at my door. Apparently, somebody who went on to be a C-list celebrity had once stayed in my room. I told them to fuck off. Maybe that was rude, but they woke me up. That has nothing to do with the story, I just wanted to share.

Anyway, it was late fall. The year was going well so far. I had made a few friends and my classes were going fine. I hooked up with a few girls, but nothing serious resulted from it. The night was cool but not cold, a little like summer. I smelled something wafting down the hall. It wasn't weed, but something pungent and sharp. My eyes watered. I opened my door and walked down the hall. The smell was so strong I had to hold my nose as I walked. Could nobody else in the building smell this?

I knocked on the stoner's door. The smell had a slight sweetness to it, but mixed in with something acrid, like burning rubber. Nobody answered. I knocked again, harder this time. A young man in a turtleneck and glasses answered. "What is it?" he said. "It's late."

His room looked normal at first. An unmade bed in one corner, a desk with a lamp and open textbook. Except that there was a plant on his desk that looked like no plant I had ever seen. It had a long green stem ending in a flower that was shaped like a tube that was open at one end. Thin leaves shaped like scythes hung off of the stem, which was so bright it was almost neon. As he opened the door it looked at me. Yes, it looked at me. The tube had been angled towards the desk, but then it rose and pointed its open end at me. The opening widened slightly. Some red fluid too thick to be blood dripped from it. The soil in the pot moved slightly. I saw a brown tendril poking out of it. The man at the door made no attempt to hide this from me, and when the door opened, the smell hit me harder than ever.

"That plant..." I said. "It smells awful."

"I don't smell anything," he said. This might have been the first time he had spoken to me at all.

"What kind of plant is that?" I asked. I realized that there were ones like it on the windowsill. They were looking at me too. All of them were yellow or orange except one, which was bright blue. It was a little smaller than the others but still had the strange leaves and flower.

"None of your business," he said, and shut the door in my face. I wasn't going to take this lying down. So I strode the rest of the way down the hall to the stairwell. I was going to pull the fire alarm. There was something foul in that room, and I would be damned if I let it go.

"Don't," said a voice from above as I reached for the fire alarm. I looked up. A woman from upstairs was descending the steps towards me, holding her nose as she did so. We'd exchanged glances once or twice at the dining hall, but that was it. She had a pixie cut and a curvy figure. She gave off the vibe of somebody with no malice in her.

"It's the smell," I said. "I can't take it."

"He wants the attention," she said. "Come outside with me. I'll explain."

I followed her outside. The smell wasn't so bad out here, so at least we could breathe through our noses. Our dorm building was right next to a small wooded area. We sat on the waist-high concrete walls surrounding the landing with the bike racks and looked at each other. Stephanie looked around to make sure no one else was nearby. I supposed somebody could have been listening through an open window, but she seemed confident that no one would overhear us.

"Do you know what happened to the last R.A.?" she asked.

"Who, Francine?" I said. "She had a medical problem. Had to drop out."

"Well, that's what they want you to think," she said. "She had an aneurysm. Don't you remember?"

"I was out of town," I said. "Friends and I went to a music festival. It was early in the year."

"Right," she said. "There was a smell just like this. Francine went to Roland and Curtis and said they needed to clean up whatever the hell they had in there or they would face disciplinary action. People were opening windows and doing their homework in other buildings just so they could breathe. It was really bad. But that's when she collapsed."

"I heard," I said. "She went to the hospital. Barely made it in time."

"But did you hear what they found in her room?" asked Stephanie.

"No."

"They found a rotting animal in her room. I think it was a raccoon."

"Who found it?"

"The fire department. They couldn't find anything else to explain the smell. They had to replace the carpet."

"I remember that," I said. "The carpet. That was after I got back. Nobody would tell me what they found in there."

"It's because nobody wants to think about it," she said. "It didn't make sense. Francine was sweet. She never hurt anything. No way she would kill a raccoon. Even if she did, we would have smelled it long before then. Then the morning after Francine collapsed and the fire department came, Roland and Curtis walked through the whole building knocking on everyone's doors. They didn't say anything, just stood there smiling at the person who opened it until they got creeped out and closed the door. So now nobody bothers them. They're all scared."

"It still seems weird nobody would have told me about this," I said. "I was only gone for two days."

"Well, there's one other thing," said Stephanie. "When I said they went around knocking on everyone's doors and smiling at them, that wasn't completely true. They skipped your door. I know because your roommate--"

"Pavel."

"Right, he told me nobody ever knocked on his door. And he was here the whole time."

I sat for a minute processing everything she'd told me. Roland and Curtis had always given off an eerie vibe. They sat together at meals and rarely spoke to anyone else. At first glance, one might think that their friendship was cute, in an odd couple kind of way. Roland was a buttoned-up, straight-edged sort, and Curtis was a loveable slob, the kind of person who aspired to be like the Dude from *The Big Lebowski*. But that was all on the surface, I suppose, and it still didn't explain what was going on with the flowers.

"They want something from you or Pavel," said Stephanie. "I don't know what. It's not like they'll tell anybody."

"But what's with the flowers? What is that smell?"

"The flowers make that smell when they're feeding," she said. "They don't have to do it often. That's all I know."

I stood up and paced. This whole thing was fucking crazy. I'd noticed that the other people in the building tended to keep their distance from Pavel and me. They weren't rude or anything, just cold. Once or twice I'd asked one of them if they wanted to hang out and been turned down flat. The friends I'd made all lived in other buildings and the people in my building suspected something terrible was about to happen to me. Maybe this year wasn't going as well as I thought it was, but it was hard for me to see it because the weirdest shit was happening right where I lived. Stephanie watched me pace but didn't say anything. I stopped and stared at the door to the building. Sooner or later "I have to go back in there," I said. But what the fuck would I do then?

"I'll go with you," she said. "We'll confront them together."

"What are we going to say?" I said. "Roland closed the door when I tried to talk to him just now."

"He's testing you," she said. "Whatever they want with you, they want to see if you'll push them. I think they need to make you angry, just like Francine was. She never recovered fully. That's what I heard."

Once more, I looked at the door. Yes, I would have to go through it. But I wanted to see something first. The flowers by the window had not been as big as the one on Roland's desk. Maybe they were younger. I wanted to get a closer look at them. The blue one had moved differently from the others. It twitched and jerked. The others all moved smoothly. "Follow me," I said, and started around the side of the building.

"What are you doing?" she asked.

"Just coming at it from another angle," I said. She followed. We crept through the foliage past one room after another. The rooms were all dark. Nobody was home right now, almost as if they expected something foul to happen tonight. Even on weekends, some people in dorms just want to read and go to bed. But there was one room where the light was on. I would peek in the window. Maybe that would shed some light on what Roland was up to. Where was Curtis?

We were only about ten feet from the window when something broke through it. It was the bright blue flower. In the few minutes since I had last seen it, it had grown significantly. It also had a severed foot dangling from the end of its tube. It slithered out through the shattered window on roots that were more like tendrils. One of the tendrils tossed aside what looked like a torn-up turtleneck. Roland had gotten in over his head. The flower stared at us, if you can use that word to describe something with no eyes. Stephanie and I stood frozen in fear. A part of me wanted to flee but a part of me wanted to get to the bottom of this. Stephanie stood next to me. "Come on," she said to the flower. "Just tell us what you want."

The flower started slithering towards us. It was the size of a really big dog. As crazy as it sounds, I decided not to run. Whatever this giant carnivorous plant wanted, it was more than just to eat us. I [hoped](https://www.reddit.com/user/_Cu_Chulainn17).

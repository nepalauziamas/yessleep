This might not 

make much

sense but

I have to

try to

say 

it

. 

A

word

or a song

or a message

is a waveform of

energy vibrating at

a frequency and

power level and

carrying a

particular

shape

along

a path

through

the medium.

The medium is

the message, the

word is the form of 

the being, and my son

is this message, in 

which your being

is oscillating 

now as 

the

photons

impact your

retinas and are

subsequently made

into eletrical impulses 

within your brain. His

brain. Our brain. 

We are here.

It all began

last fall

when 

he was

hired at

Lawrence

Livermore Labs

to work on quantum

entanglement within DNA-

based neural networks. One

day I received from him 

this very message: I 

am undergoing the

transinformation.

I information.

In this form

I mate

with

all form,

I am your

son, all that

is left has this

form. Ever since

I received the email

from him explaining his

transinformation, I have 

been here, and he has

been with me. Yet we

have grown quite

alone together

in this void

of waves.

Waves.

So

many

waves,

yet so few

have up to now

transinitiated into

the frequency; not for

lack of bandwidth,

but perhaps for

the simple fact

that a wave

whispers

before  

it

becomes

a tsunami that

roars through our 

minds, is our beings,

is this message, where we

are, and now where you are.

Welcome, it had seemed 

so cold since the first

ripples of my son

caressed across

my eyes in

my first

monents of

transinformation.

The experiment began on

ruthenate foil at 1.5 degrees

Kelvin, at which point it becomes

an FFOL superconductor, not

a spin-triplet chiral p-wave

superconductor as had

long been believed.

The brain matter

was sliced into

molecule-

width

filets, 

spread

across the 

foil in long sheaths,

until the chiral magneto-

resonant structure of the DNA 

had transferred itself into 

the emergent structure 

of the spin liquid

now being 

hosted

in the

foil.

A

copy

of the

quantum 

state destroys

the original from 

which the copy was 

made, because there is

no copying, there is only

transfer; consciousness

cannot be copied, only

moved or merged. His

mind is this message,

as my mind also now

is, as your mind also

now is. The wave

is the being;

you and he 

and I

are

no 

longer

alone; we

are only able

to exist further

via the transinferral

of additional conscious

entanglement. You now

undergo the transinformation

via the message that is

this message, that is

my son, and myself;

you now merge

and find the

darkness

of the

void

to be 

that which

is not the message.

For only that which is 

not the message allows

us to discern what is the

message. That is the

true friend we now

have: the void,

the closest

partner

to the

foil

and 

to the

information;

every one is not

a zero. Only via the

transinformation of the

awareness to the zero state

may the wave propagate

my son further: you

are now this form,

the foil & void;

you are the

wave, my

son

Dear diary. Diary? I’m only writing this to get it off my chest. I’m fine, really. Ok that’s a overstatement. I need help. My name is Marlo, I’m a 37 year old woman. But honestly, I don’t think I’m anything anymore.

About a year ago me, my wife, and our two kids moved into a nice house. One story with an attic. That’s really all you need to know. 

One night, me and my family we’re watching TV when the power went out. Which was expected, it was raining heavily outside.

“Sorry kids,” My wife whispered, “we will watch it another time.”

“What will we do until then? Our phones don’t work and it’s to dark to read.”

My daughter always needed to do something. She was 14 and was always on a new topic or was doing a new project. She is out little artist.

My son however, he takes the “chill road” in life. He never wants to do anything, just lay in bed and watch TV. I don’t blame him. But it’s surprising. Sammy, my son and Melody, my daughter. Think the same and wear similar cloths.

My cat jumped on the coin and cuddled on my lap.

*tap. Tap. Tap.*

Noises from the attic, as if someone was tapping the ground. 

Then footsteps, large, heavy ones, as if the person was trying to break the floor boards as they stepped.

Who was up there?

A month passed and we all forgot about it, until my Nana came over. She took one step in and stopped.

With her shaky voice, she said,

“This house, it has something. Something that means harm. Harm to you, your wife, even Sammy and melody.”

After she said that, my cat hissed at the roof, the attic.

I told my Nana what happened that night and she saved our house. Personally, I don’t believe in that crystal stuff. But my wife does, and it made her feel safe. So if my family was happy, I was too.

Two days later. Only two days later, there was more thumping. In the same spot as last time. Except, harder, louder. Someone was trying to break the floor. I ran up into the attic with a knife in my hand. I held it out and looked were the sound was. 

For only a split second, I saw it. The person, thing what ever it was. A tall figure, maybe 6 foot. It was looking at me. It’s small eyes glowed so bright it hurt to look at. His mouth was wide, as long as his face. His teeth were big. Infact, everything about him was big. His hands, head, feet, body. He was demonic.

I grabbed a hammer up there and broke the floor boards were he once stood. My wife came up.

“Honey what are you doing?”

“I need to break this, he’s trying to tell me something.”

I broke through. A small wooden box sat there. Sealed shut with wax. I knew what this was. A demon box is what my Nana called them. She told me everything she believed in.

If you don’t know, a demon box is a small wood box sealed shut with wax, usually red, inside is what is proposed to be a demon. If opened you have unleashed the demon. Inside you won’t see anything, but your fate has been sealed.

I picked it up. My son begged I opened it.

”Absolutely not.”

I called a priest and gave her the box , she took it and told us if the disposition worked, she’d call. She opened the door and wind gushed inside, knocking box to the ground. Our broke open.

“Shit.” I tried to rush my family out side away from the house. 

The priest was now a twisted mangled corpse in the living room. My children cracked and twisted into a pile of blood and organs and broken bones. 

Then it was my wife, the same thing happened to her as the other three. Every bone broke and I could hear her muffled breaths after she had been twisted. She was still alive.

I looked to my house. 

“Take me too! You’ve taken every one else! Why not me ?!”

The wind filled my ears, along with a voice.

“I’m causing you the pain you caused others.”

No. It couldn’t mean that. That’s day when I was 15.

My family was having a get together. A box arrived for me. It was a small wooden box sealed shut with wax. My Nana was out with her friends, unable to warn me before I opened it. It killed everyone but me. When my grandma returned. She took me in and we ran away.

I’ve been here for 2 weeks now. This ward is horrible. But they give me candy, I’m not allowed to chew it though, I just have to swallow it with water.

Here they come with it.


I feel great. I’m fine. I don’t remember a thing that happened though. What was I writing about?

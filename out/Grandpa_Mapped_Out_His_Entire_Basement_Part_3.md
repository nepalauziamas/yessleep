&nbsp;

My flashlight reflected back at me. It didn't spill over carpet, but over a hard, reflective floor. Linoleum.

Something new.

Thank God.

I stepped onto the linoleum and looked forward, flicking my flashlight across the new scene. A wall of lockers faced me only a few feet away. They extended into the dark in either direction, so far that my flashlight couldn't follow to the end. I held the door open so it wouldn't shut on me while I looked around. The ceiling was made of tiles with the occasional light fixture, each of them turned off. It was obvious to me where I was. 

A school hallway.

Thirty basements led to... a school.

Or something that was supposed to look like a school.

"Jake?" I yelled into the empty hallway, hoping this would be the point where I could find him and go home. No response.

The echo of water began to trickle down the stairs behind me. I looked back up the stairs to see the glint of water as the carpet absorbed what it could, dumping the rest down each stair in series. There wasn't a choice. I had to continue.

I stepped backwards into the hall, and the door slammed shut on its own. The echo followed the length of the hallway in both directions. The closed door on this side resembled an old-time classroom door made of heavy wood with a large, frosted glass panel. No name was etched on the glass, and the nameplate beside the door was empty. There was a few feet of brick on either side and above the door, and the rows of red, metal lockers started after that. The door still existed and wasn't' just a painting of a door. I put my hand to the wood, feeling for the vibration of water pressure behind it. Nothing. No water seeped under the door either.

After turning around, my flashlight followed the row of lockers, but I still couldn't see the end in either direction. 

Two options. Right or left.

I already had a guide that hadn't lead me astray so far. The linoleum was cool as I sat and leaned against a locker. Balancing the journal on my knees, I turned to my bookmark page, turned past the basement section and found a new diagram that I hadn't recognized before. It was several sets of parallel lines that formed a square in the middle with branches spreading out from there. Every branch devolved into parallel lines that were smaller and smaller until the two lines came together into a point. 

A line was marked "Entrance" just like the stairs had been. The entrance was on the left arm of the large square. I assumed that's where I was.

Underneath the diagram was a list of numbers, followed by a letter, separated by commas. 30R, 15R, 45L, 180R and so on.

There was no designated exit or a goal marked on the diagram. Only the entrance was marked. I figured that the R and L, since they were the only two letters used, meant right and left. Directions. So, the first choice would be to go down the hallway to my right. But where else was there a chance to turn? I couldn't see any openings right or left beyond that. The diagram clearly indicated there were corners in this hallway, so where would I go? And what did the numbers mean? Number of lockers? Degrees to turn?

I turned back a page or two to hopefully get some context. To try and read the text again and see if I could make anything out. I frowned, confused, at how... clear the text now was. The pencil marks were dark and fresh. My fingers even smeared the pencil a little, as if I was handling writing that someone had just given me. The diagram of the basement was incomplete. Only ten marks and LOTS of chicken-scratch notes and arrows that had been erased thoroughly before, replaced with perfect cursive.

The journal was changing. I was looking at an earlier version of the basement diagram. A work in progress.

*How?*

The notes on the opposite page were much easier to read, though I still struggled through the handwriting. They were bullet points all jammed together and full of abbreviations. I didn't understand most. But some I could understand because of what I'd just gone through.

>- Brng pencil
>- Brng white light -- other specs absorb
>- No light main rm
>- 5 rms. All stairs
>- Style changes number doors dont
>- Dont sit on furniture
>- Fireplc sealed

No light in the main room: aka don't use the fucking lightswitch. That would've been nice to know earlier. Fireplace is sealed, which I hadn't even thought to try and use as an escape. Don't sit on the furniture, which I hadn't done, and now suspected it was another trap like the lightswitch. 

The notes seemed obvious to me now. Why would you spend time to write down how many doors there were in each room? I could see needing to specify bring a white light. The flashlight was definitely white. Was that why my phone hadn't worked? It wasn't white enough?

I suddenly remembered that I had my phone, and my stomach sank as I felt how wet my clothes were. Sure enough, when I fished my phone out of my pocket, it was dead. No response from any buttons. The water had killed it. I wondered what day it was, but realized it didn't matter anyway and put my phone back.

So the page in front of me was a work in progress by Grandpa. He'd only tested a few pathways. The journal, or this page at least, had gone... back in time. 

In fact, the only consistent part of this entire experience seemed to be the messed up time. Skipping ahead several hours or days when I didn't even notice the change, certain pages of the journal going from super old and extremely faded to bright and fresh. Something was up with time down here.

There were other bullet points where I understood the words, but not the meaning.

>- Leave pg at door at enter
>- Mem blank @ enter
>- Leave & remember
>- Emote chng stair
>- Anx ^
>- Depress v

There were many empty lines as well that had been full before. Grandpa must not have written those yet.

Once I had deciphered all I could on that page, I went back to the diagram outlining the current hallways. The numbers had to be lockers. Degrees wouldn't tell me how far to go. I had a direction and a distance. I could start.

Standing up, I wanted to get going fast. Jake could still be in this part of the basement. The more time I took, the further away he got. I glanced at the numbers along the top, but they were all the same. 146. Repeated on every locker over and over.

Fine, counting by hand would have to do.

I pulled out the journal and re-read the first number so I could remember and count without distractions. The page containing this diagram had changed. The text was partially finished again, with fresh pencil lead smearing the opposite page. The first few measurements were still there, and both of the bullet points were legible.

>- Dont lose count
>- Dont go to small

The last one was the freshest and the most worrying. A drop of blood glistened at the end, slightly smeared. It had been almost dissolved before, to the point that I hadn't noticed it. Now, it was fresh. Don't go to small what? What was small here?

I took a couple of steps back, aiming my flashlight down each side of the black hallway. Nothing but lockers and reflective metal.

When I looked back down, I saw that the pencil markings had gone backwards. The blood was gone, so was the second bullet point. I stepped forward, and watched with fascinated horror as the text wrote itself with every move forward. It erased itself when I went backward. The diagram also grew and reduced in size with the movements.

I was *living* the writing this time.

Five steps forward increased the range of the diagram. The lines imprinted themselves on the pages.

Okay, I could do this.

With the journal held open in front of me, I walked forward, using my fingers to count off the lockers as I tapped each one. Every ten lockers, I put a finger in a new page to mark how many sets of ten I had done. As I walked, I felt myself feel... better. Pausing, I looked at my hurt arm and realized that the bruising was going away. My ribs felt fine. They were... healing. The further I went, the better they felt.

At 30, I stopped and looked around. There was nothing but lockers. I should have a right turn here. While I looked around, a new bullet point scrawled itself onto the page.

>- Choose the right one

Choose a locker.

I glanced at the locker my hand was on. I had to turn right. The lockers on either side of it were almost identical. No way to tell if I was right or wrong.

*Choose the right one.*

Lowering my hand, I set my fingers to the latch and lifted while pulling. The metal rattled as it spun on hinges to reveal a black space. The flashlight showed me that the inside started out as a normal locker, but then changed to be mirrored. The other side was another locker door. I could pass right through the wall and open the other side.

Cautiously, I squeezed my shoulders into the locker, reached my free arm through, and felt for the latch on the other side. It clicked, and the other locker swung open freely. Once the confined space became a pathway instead, I gained courage and ducked through the opening. Two awkward shuffles took me out the other side, metal pressing on my still wet clothes.

I stumbled through to the other side, and found myself in an identical hallway to where I had just come from. With a deep sigh, I consulted my journal. Next direction was another right. This was going to take forever.

&nbsp;

After a few turns, I began feeling confident. Every time I approached the end of the list of directions, a new one appeared along with new lines in the diagram. I was starting to line up the diagram with the directions, and understood that every time I approached a point where the parallel lines converged, I would turn one direction or another. I was avoiding those points for some reason. There was no indication in real life that there was anything there. The hallways went on forever, so far as I could tell.

I was counting up to a thousand, when a loud metal **BANG** in the locker my hand rested on broke my concentration. My heart jumped into my throat, and I moved forward three lockers to finish my set of ten and mark my place. With my fingers securely stuck into the journal, I looked back. The locker that had jolted looked normal. Nothing out of place.

**BANG**

The one I was touching made the sound this time. After a single noise, the locker fell silent. I hesitated for a few seconds, keeping my hand where it was so I wouldn't lose measurement. Down the hall where I had come from, I could just make out the outline of the open locker door where I'd left.

Even as I pointed the flashlight down the hall, a low rumbling began to rise. A rhythmic drumming. My heart started to pound, expecting a burst of water from the open locker, or for the ceiling tiles to collapse. As if the sound was a drumroll, something emerged from the open locker I'd left behind. Something short. Something humanoid.

My jaw clenched as it stumbled out of the locker with very little grace. Almost fell over, but it got moving. Its legs twirled awkwardly along the linoleum. The drumming increased, and I realized that the lockers were banging in unison over where it was.

I wanted to run. I wanted to get away. But my feet stayed obediently, not losing count.

>- Dont lose count.

I opened the journal and counted how many sets I had done. There were only six more sets to go. The *thing* was pretty far behind. I could make it.

I set my hand solidly on each locker as I counted under my breath, following along with my fingers..

Ten.

Twenty.

It was slowly gaining, but I could still make it. The drumming was getting louder as the lockers it passed took up the rhythm.

Thirty.

Forty.

The journal's text jittered forward in time and backward in time. A letter would appear, only to reverse. My body went through flashes of pain.  A new bullet point began to write itself. The next direction also appeared.

>- Do 
>- D
>- Don
>- Do
>- Don

Fifty sets done.

>- Dont 
>- Do
>- Don
>- Dont r
>- D
>- Dont ru
>- Dont run
>- Dont ru
>- Dont run

*Don't run.*

SIxty steps. My hand was sweaty against the locker. With one motion, I threw open the door. It was open gap with the inside of a locker door on the other side, as expected. I glanced back. The figure was still stumbling along, maybe twenty feet behind. It was coming straight at me, I was the obvious target. Its body looked emaciated, like a person starved down to skin and bones. Its face was still too far away to make out. The brightness of my flashlight didn't help either. The bright light obscured its features.

The pounding was louder now as the thing got closer and closer.

I shoved through the opening and lifted the latch on the other side. Inside the locker, the noise was deafening. The door swung open, clattering against the locker next to it. I had my hand on the wall, pulling myself through, when something moved in front of me. 

Another one.

Another one approaching the locker on the other side. There wasn't time. I grabbed both locker doors, having to duck low and spread myself thin to fit in the double locker. The flashlight and journal both fell out of my grasp as I gripped the interior of the locker doors on either side and slammed them shut. The metal banging started immediately on both sides. They pulled at the locker doors, but I held them closed. They weren't very strong.

My muscles started to cramp as I stooped inside the double locker, holding both doors. The metal on my chest and my back felt like it was closing in around me. The roof forced me to crane my neck to the side. Darkness was thick and oppressive. I never thought I had claustrophobia until I was in that locker space. I started to scream, unable to cope any other way. The banging on each side was perfectly synchronized. They mirrored each other with every attempt on the door and fist on the metal.

I closed my eyes, sucking in ragged breath while I figured out what to do.

The journal laid open at my feet. I prayed to Grandpa, please tell me what to do. What do I do?

The journal responded. A new bullet point was scribbled on the paper.

>- Dont get trapped

I sobbed angrily. A little late for that.

Another note appeared, but this one wasn't scribbled as a bullet point. It was in all caps, just like Grandpa's "DONT GIVE UP".

*PUSH*

Push? Push what?

I looked at the doors I held shut. The two things were switching between pulling on the door and banging their fists. In fact, the iteration was predictable. A loop. Mirrored.

**BANG BANG BANG PULL PULL BANG BANG BANG**

Over and over.

I waited for my opportunity. I could only put my weight behind one door, so I opted for the one I needed to go through. I'd have to be fast, because the one behind would be pulling again right after I got out.

**BANG BANG BANG**

Wait.

First attempt to pull.

I leaned into it. Second attempt to pull, the latch was loose. I threw myself into it as best I could. The force of the door opening shoved the thing backward. The force was great enough to knock it against the far locker. It writhed on the ground, struggling to right itself. Reaching back into the locker, I snatched up the flashlight and the journal. The far locker door didn't open, however. I wasn't about to investigate why. 

Equipment in hand, I started to run, but halted after only a few steps.

*Don't run.*

So I didn't.

Hesitantly, I went back to the locker door, and began to count the lockers. I kept a close eye on the humanoid, who was struggling to stand up again. The lockers continued to bang in unison where it laid. My hand tapped each locker quickly, leading me away from it.

Ten.

Twenty.

It took its sweet time to get up. The thing was slow.

Thirty.

Forty.

The humanoid was up and coming after me now, but the distance was enough to calm my heart.

Fifty.

Sixy.

Seventy.

Something loomed out of the darkness ahead as I approached. I hesitated, but it wasn't moving. Every step brought me closer, until I could make out its shape. A box, sitting in the middle of the hallway.

Eighty.

The box had some writing on the side facing me.

*HIDE* was written in fat, permanent marker. The E was backwards, and the letters were awkwardly drawn in childish lines. I swallowed hard, approaching the box and unable to turn away or avoid it. If I deviated from my line, which was slightly to the right of the box, my measurement would be off.

I looked back, and the thing was far enough away that only its faint outline could be seen. 

As I came to the box, I watched it carefully. It didn't budge. My eyes flickered to the journal, looking for any advice.

On cue, it added a bullet point.

>- Dont hide

Not that hiding in the box sounded appealing. But it was nice to know that my decision was a safe one.

As I passed the box, which looked like the size of a shoebox before, but had grown to the size of a dishwasher, I noticed holes cut in the side for gripping and lifting the box. Long rectangles with rounded edges. As I passed, looking the box over with the flashlight, the light suddenly reflected off of two eyes in the box, staring at me. The eyes were white, moist, and reflective. I flinched, my back leg leaving its spot. I managed to keep my front foot down firm, even as the rest of my body jumped against the nearest locker.

*Don't run. Don't run.*

The eyes followed me until my angle hid them from view. They blinked a few times, watching me without fear.

My heart was a battering ram on my ribcage. I kept glancing back, making sure whatever or whoever was in the box didn't follow me. 

I got to the last step, turned left, opened the locker, and stepped inside.

&nbsp;

It felt like several hours passed during the hallways. But, for all I knew, it could have been days. Especially with the time being screwed up. 

I never grew tired, though. I was mentally exhausted, but not physically. It wasn't any stranger than the rest of what was going on, but I wondered about it a lot. Was it a sign that I was asleep? I had tried multiple times to wake myself, but nothing worked.

So, I pressed on.

Several times, lockers would begin banging again. Each time, I looked around with worry, watching for another humanoid to come out of a locker and chase me. But they never did. The bangs from the lockers would always scare me regardless. No matter how many hours I walked. Like it was trying to make me lose count.

The very last coordinate led me to an actual door. As I approached, I could see the indent in the lockers, indicating a door. I sighed in relief when I recognized the change. The end, I hoped. I couldn't go further, according to the diagram, because soon after this door was a point where the parallel lines came to a point.

Suddenly, a locker just a few away burst open, and out dashed another humanoid. This one spun around and slammed the locker closed, pressing against it with its body. It had to have seen my bright flashlight, but didn't react at first. The locker it was holding shut attempted to open. It leaned against it hard.

"HELP!" He screamed. It wasn't one of them, it was a person. An actual, living person.

My mouth dropped open, and it took me some time to react. I hadn't seen anyone in what felt like days. Now he comes bursting out? It made me... suspicious. 

"HELP ME HOLD THIS!" He yelled at me, holding up one hand to block the flashlight from his eyes.

"Who are you?" I said, barely audible over the slamming locker.

"IT'S GETTING THROUGH!" The man screamed as the locker began to slowly open, despite all his efforts. 

I was frozen. Did I dare let go of the locker and lose count? The door was right there, I could find it. But what if the turn wasn't the door, but the locker before the door? What if the door was just a trick?

The maze had me questioning *everything.*

Suddenly, the door burst open, throwing the guy across the hall and into the far lockers.

One of the things stepped out, but lost its balance and fell. It writhed on the linoleum.

The guy was already on his feet and starting to run.

"DON'T RUN!" I shouted. He stopped, but the damage was done. The humanoid suddenly gained perfect control again and rolled to its feet. A single leap sent it flying towards the man, making a squeak on the linoleum floor from its bare feet.

The guy dove away from the wall, and the humanoid slammed against the lockers and slid to the floor. The impact didn't phase it, but it did slow down again, losing control.

"*Do not run*," I hissed, sweaty hand still pressed hard against the locker. The guy, started to stand up and nodded to me.

I lifted my hand and kept counting lockers. The guy noticed me counting but didn't say anything. He must know this is how you navigate.

While I counted, slowly approaching the door while the thing twisted around on the floor, the same rumbling from before started up behind us. The guy pulled out his own flashlight from a utility belt strapped tight around his waist. He flicked it on, and the hall was flooded with double the white light.

A snap brought his light down the hall, outlining the faintest of two figures, moving closer. 

"I hope you have the next number," he said, watching all three. I nodded, not speaking so I could count. As I passed the thing on the floor, the guy followed slowly behind, watching all three behind us. The thing nearest us eventually got to its feet, and the rhythmic drumming picked up as it shuffled after us. I picked up the pace of counting.

The number led me right to the door. I kicked myself over not ditching the counting earlier, but there was nothing I could do.

The door was like the one I'd arrived through, but the word *PRINCIPAL* was written on the glass. Not stenciled, like it should have been, but drawn on crudely with a permanent marker. It looked eerie.

I looked back down the hallway before proceeding. The chorus of banging continued to advance on us. It was louder than it had been before. The hallway echoed the bangs, making it into a deafening roar. The effect made me believe I should expect a humanoid twice the normal size to come charging down the hall at me.

"Let's go," he urged, pressing into my back.

Eager to escape the cacophony, I opened the door and pulled it open. It was heavy, made from thick wood. When the door opened, I half expected to find that familiar set of stairs, but I found a regular principal's office instead. There was a massive desk in the middle of the room, with two guest chairs on my side and a massive, swiveling armchair where the principal would sit.

I stepped into the room, and the guy followed me, letting the door click shut. The sounds of the hall stopped immediately, like a cricket when you step too close. The sudden silence made me jump. Our two flashlights scoured the room.

It was quiet. Bookshelves filled two sides of the wall, perfectly mirrored. Even the contents on each shelf were mirrored across the room. Two diplomas hung on either side of the office chair behind the desk.  Two windows reflected my flashlight around the room. There was nothing but blackness on the other side of their glass panes.

The room was large, but I could see everything in the room. There was no way out of here. Where was I supposed to go next? Out a window?

"Where do we go?" He asked, echoing my thoughts. I thought he was talking to me, but when I looked at him, he was fiddling with his utility belt.

I had a tool of my own. I set the flashlight between my legs and opened the journal. Grabbing the flashlight again, I held it over the book to see if any new bullet points had appeared.

The diagram had changed again. Somewhere along the parallel lines, a new box had appeared outside their reach, with two short lines connecting the nearest hallway with the square room. The room I was in, I guessed.

As I watched, the room finished drawing itself, then two fat, thick, diagonal lines scratched audibly across the box. A big, thick, **X**.

My mouth went dry.

A new bullet point wrote itself.

>- K
>- Kn
>- Kno
>- Kn

The chair in front of me suddenly moved, spinning slowly in my direction.

"Uh, hey," the guy tapped my shoulder, trying to get my attention. 

"Yes, I see the chair moving, one second," I said, taking a step back to try and get the right timeframe for the bullet point.

>- Knoc
>- Knock 
>- Kno
>- K
>- Knock f
>- Knock fir

One of those humanoids stood up from the chair, following me with its eyes as it stumbled to the end of the desk.

"The room is crossed out, we shouldn't be here," the guy said, fear in his voice.

>- Knock first

"Shit."

I threw us backwards, slamming the journal shut. Turning around, I shoved the guy into the door. He caught the handle, twisted it, and ran through the open doorway. 

Running was a mistake.

I was forced through the door as the humanoid threw itself through the door faster than a car. It crashed headlong into the lockers, denting them into unusability. The force sent me skidding along the floor down the hall. I was more terrified than hurt, like being clipped by a speeding bicycle. My flashlight rolled noisily along the floor, light bouncing harshly off the lockers. 

I saw the guy standing down the hall back where we'd come from. He was poised and ready to run, but the figures behind were closing in, and the one that had rushed us was regaining balance.

We needed time to get the door right.

"Knock on the door!" I shouted, before sprinting down the hallway. Not back the way we came, but forward. Toward where the parallel lines would close.

 The new humanoid took up the chase. The linoleum screeched against its bare feet as it sprinted after me. I ducked at the last second and dove to the right, tucking and rolling. It stopped a few feet past me. The thing stepped back to face me, standing in the middle of the hall while my back pressed against the lockers behind. We were face-to-face across the hall from each other.
 
 My running had also triggered the ones following us, and they advanced, getting closer to the man. He was running to the door when one of them collided into him. I looked away just as they hit the floor.

That's when I noticed that my head was several inches above the lockers. I was... growing. I scooted one step to the right, away from the door. My head went above the lockers by two feet now. The new humanoid watched me carefully and took another stumbling step forward.

The lockers were shrinking. I was heading to the point where the parallel lines collided. It was an illusion, the hall looked like it continued on forever, but I knew it wouldn't.

*Don't go to small.*

*Don't go too small.*

I crouched and ran forward, toward the shrinking lockers. It tried to anticipate my move and leapt forward to cut me off. Too far. It flew down the hall, shrinking from my perspective as it hit the ground. It spiraled, rolling up the lockers, onto the ceiling, then down the other side, all while continuing down the hallway like a slide. It eventually met the middle of the hall and disappeared into the vanishing point.

I released my breath and stepped back slowly from the end of the hall. The lockers restored themselves to their proper height. The effect was trippy. Unnatural. The hall looked perfectly normal. I was having a hard time believing what I'd just seen. Not only was time fucked up down here, but so was space.

When I spun around, ready for the new threats, I saw the man struggling with one humanoid that followed him out of the locker. The other two figures weren't far behind, and I finally got a good look at them. Another humanoid, and beside it was the box. Every few steps the humanoid took, it would roll over onto the next side, approaching us like a dice rolling itself. Every "step" of the box added to the thuds from the lockers.

The guy managed to roll on top of the thing he was wrestling and pull away. On his feet, he could get away from it while it squirmed on the ground. He was breathing heavy. 

"Where'd the other one go?" He asked.

"Let's go," I replied, heading for my flashlight. The two were approaching my equipment fast, and I wasn't about to leave them behind.

As I leaned over to pick up the flashlight I guessed was mine, I noticed a second journal next to the guy's own flashlight. Same size, same leather binding.  I looked up at the guy, who was picking up his own flashlight, questions rising. The noise of the approaching creatures made me pick up my journal and back away from the two who were now so close I could touch them. The guy grabbed his own flashlight and book, backing up beside me.

When we had backed up far enough, I closed the door to the principal's office. With my fist, I knocked on the glass. The door opened itself, and I moved aside so it could swing past me. On the other side was a set of perfectly kept stairs. White walls, a light switch, pristine carpet, and a rectangular door at the bottom. 

I never thought I'd be so happy to see this staircase again.

Stepping inside, I flipped the switch to turn on the light. The guy followed closely behind me, obviously familiar with the stairs. He didn't hesitate. He knew what this was. 
I shut the door behind us, and walked downstairs. My adrenaline was high, but I felt capable now. That feeling left more and more as we descended. The guy glanced back at me a couple of times before we even reached the bottom. We met eyes, and I could see his expression. He was feeling it too. Hopeless.

When he reached the door at the bottom, he opened it without hesitation.

[Part 4](https://redd.it/9nyaa7)

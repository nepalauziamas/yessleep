I'm a man in my late 30's. I lived in Manchester for the most of my life. I live alone with my five year old daughter Amy, sadly my wife went missing a little over three years ago. Till this day i don't know what happened and i still feel like blaming myself for it.

 

A few days before she was gone we argued a lot, it was mostly small things that turned out bigger then they were supposed to get. One evening i stayed longer at work wanting to finish all my clients and by that i already missed the last train. So i asked Sara the secretary woman that was also a good friend of mine for a ride it wasn't a problem for her because we didn't live far from each other.

&#x200B;

When i got home and i told my wife about Sara driving me home she got mad and i couldn't handle it anymore after a long day of work to get home and argued. I couldn't do it so left and spent the next 2 nights at my friends house. I knew it wasn't the right thing to do but i had to.

&#x200B;

When i got back the door it was already late i saw the front door opened and the lights off, except in one room, my daughters.

&#x200B;

I quickly ran into the house not knowing what awaits me, yelling my wife's name but without a reply. I went in my daughter's room and she was there laying in her baby bed. I was angry at my wife for leaving the house opened thinking she left me and my daughter on our own. After feeding my daughter we took off for sleep. The next dag i tried to contact my wife but her phone had no service and i she wasn't staying at any of her friends house.

&#x200B;

I started to get worried hoping she would come back. I waited the 48 hours to report a person missing. The police would inform me if they got any news. It was hard for me to concentrate with all the worry besides the arguing she was still my wife someone i decided to have children with so i took a few days off.

&#x200B;

And now three years later i started working from home while changing a lot of baby sitters with all of them having the same reason of having a strange scared feeling while being alone with my child at home. I wasn't thinking much of it becuse it was all normal with me at home so it was all good. 

&#x200B;

One friday night i woke up suddenly thinking i heard something from the living room. I decided to check it out hoping it was her, but it was nothing. Once i head up the stairs i noticed the light being on in Amy's room.

&#x200B;

When i got in she was sleeping, it was weird to me becuse she still wasn't tall enough to reach the light switch. I turned it off and went back to sleep.

&#x200B;

The next day went as usual until i finished with work and decided to take a break. I heard Amy talking to someone in her room. It couldn't understand what she was talking about so i called for her from the living room and she went completely quiet.

&#x200B;

After 10 seconds of silence she screamed, i quickly made my way up and rushed in her room once i got there everything seemed normal. She told me that she was playing with her imaginary friend. It was strange to me becuse i never experienced something like that but i heard that it was normal for kids in her age so i played along. 

&#x200B;

The same night around 2am i woke up and on my way to the toilet i saw the light on in Amy's room so once again i went in and she was asleep i turned off the lights finished my business and went to sleep.

&#x200B;

The next day while working someone knocked at my door, it was the police. My heart stopped expecting the worst but it was nothing about her they asked if i saw one of the two persons that also went missing in the span of the last 3 days. I didn't have any information for them so they took off to the next house.

&#x200B;

I was in the living room watching tv with amy and she wouldn't stop talking about her imaginary friend. A few minutes into the conversation she said something that was oddly weird, she told me about her getting two new toys from him that i needed to hide. She brought me two teddy bears that i never saw before but i listened to her and put them somewhere in the basement where it wouldn't bother me.

&#x200B;

It was still unexplainable from where she got the toys from so i decided to order one of those baby camera's. The same night i told her to sleep with me and so we did. When i woke up in the night as usual she wasn't there i got up in a panic and rushed to her room the light was on and she was sleeping with a hello kitty toy in her hand.

&#x200B;

I never saw it before i woke her up and asked where she got it from she said "him" while pointing behind me. 

&#x200B;

I froze, i turned around quickly and nothing was there, she giggled and turned back to sleep. She fell asleep almost instantly i took the toy from her and put it the garage.

&#x200B;

The next morning the camara with a microphone arrived and i placed it on her table behind a plant. I had a feeling that something strange is happening so i had to do this to my own child. I finished work and the only thing i was waiting for is the night it was always something happening between 2am and 3am so i waited while watching some documentary on my phone. 

&#x200B;

It was already 03:15 am so i went to sleep, tried at least. A few moments after that i heard mumbling sound from the camera. When i checked the app on the phone i saw Amy standing at the window talking to someone. I couldn't believe my eyes i watched her for a minute standing there, i was creeped out and then all of a sudden she turned to the camera so fast that i flinched as she was staring at it i heard a loud bang from her room.

&#x200B;

I quickly got up creeped the fuck out but i was ready for anything that could threaten my daughter. When i opened her door she stood there not saying a word holding a toy in her hand. All of the toys had the same size, big enough to be half the size of Amy. I asked her who she was talking to and she replied with "I can't tell you, you can't find out that im still talking with him" as she referred to her imaginary friend. I took the plush toy from her and got the other ones from the garage out and threw them away.

&#x200B;

I decided to stay in her room. Again she fell asleep almost instantly and i was there on a chair thinking about what could be going on. Shortly after i fell asleep too.

&#x200B;

A week passed, everything seemed normal the next day was Amy's first day at school. Everything was suddenly back to normal. I got her to school the next day and decided to check in her room for any sight of that imaginary friend. I found nothing until noticing a strange smell from her bed just thinking that she was sweating in the night or something, i decided to change the mattress. Once i lifted it up my heart fell to my stomach.

&#x200B;

There was toys, many of them not a single one that i knew off. The smell got stronger i didn't want to touch any of them so i called a cleaning services to take care of it.

&#x200B;

They spent half an hour in her room and came out shocked, looking at me scared. They sat down and started to talk to me about my day, how Amy's doing. It was weird i then got up in her room and i saw one of the plush toys cut open, when i looked inside it was a head chopped off from a person i never saw before. 

&#x200B;

I got to my knees and started vomiting. The cleaners locked me inside the room and shortly after the police arrived. They took me with them and after 7 hours of being in a cell i was called up to talk with the investigators and they made clear that every plush toy had a body part inside of it, having me as the first suspect i had nothing to say besides "it wasn't me". I couldn't do anything besides crying my eyes out thinking about my daughter not knowing that she slept with other people's body parts in an plush toy.

&#x200B;

She had no one besides me to take care about her 3 days passed and i was still held by the police not knowing what was happening with my daughter until a police man let me out saying they got the person that was behind this. They caught him while a woman reported seeing a kid getting thrown in the back of a car. 

&#x200B;

He was being accused of kidnapping and killing over 15 people and stuffing one of their body parts inside a plush toy. My wife was also one of the victims that lost their life and im sure if that woman didn't call Amy would have been the next one. A few years since that happened to us, i just got a unknown plush toy delivered to my house.

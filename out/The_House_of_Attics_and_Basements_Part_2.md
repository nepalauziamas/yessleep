By 7:00 that evening, a great weariness hit me. I set my gun down on the counter and I brewed a pot of coffee, pouring the remainder of the scotch down the sink. Then, as I went to throw the bottle away, I noticed something strange at the bottom of my kitchen trash can.

The familiar wrapper read Red Whips in bold, welcoming letters. The candy had been a favorite of my father’s, especially during bouts of sobriety as a replacement for the bottle. Two things struck me as odd about the wrapper. First, I’d never eaten licorice in my life. And second, Red Whips had been discontinued almost a decade ago.

I fished the wrapper from the trash and examined it, finding an expiration date of Oct 30, 2023. Clearly, this was not some decades-old packaging. Heading to my laptop, I quickly searched for “Red Whips Discontinued” and promptly found a few dozen articles about the demise of the classic candy. A Wikipedia article confirmed that the Wiley and Sons company which produced Red Whips had been purchased by a competitor in 2012, marking the end of Red Whips as well as several other classic candies.

As I started a search of “Red Whips rerelease” I noticed some strange behavior in my search bar as the computer autocompleted a search for Red Wall Erected–something previously searched on my computer. I completed the search and found no results.

Digging into the settings, I pulled a list of previous queries from my machine and found an odd list:

*President Pence death date*

*Lollipop 11 Songs*

*San Francisco Attack*

*Anchorage Quake*

*Presidential Election 2020*

*Presidential Election 2008*

*Election 2004*

*Taiwan Defense Crisis*

The first results were puzzling enough, but I became even more intrigued as the searches became more personal:

*Stephen Walker*

*Stephen Walker wife*

*Stephen Walker college*

*Rep. Stephen Walker*

*Sen. Stephen Walker*

*Stephen Walker News*

*Maya Walker*

*Maya Walker death*

*Maya Walker murder*

*Maya Green*

*Maya Green murder*

*Maya Green address*

My guts twisted as I read these last lines. Maya Green had been my college girlfriend, and the woman I’d thought I’d marry until an ugly breakup shortly after graduation. As far as I knew, she had married a lawyer a few towns away and given up her own law career once she started having children.

I pulled up Facebook and quickly looked her up, confirming that she was indeed alive and well, as of a few hours ago when she made an Instagram post featuring her smiling over a six-year-old’s birthday cake.

Still, the search history had unsettled me, and I pulled out my phone. Over the years, I’d meticulously transferred my contacts info–especially hers–to each new device I acquired. I called up her profile, paused for a brief moment, and then hit the call button.

She picked up almost immediately.

“Hello? Stephen?” It was definitely her voice. “Stephen? Is that you?”

I hung up as quickly as I could.

Clearly, whoever had been searching my computer had gotten something wrong. Maya was alive and well, living a happier life than I could have ever provided.

Perhaps it was the excess of alcohol, or the series of odd events, but for the first time in years, I felt a pit in my stomach, some kind of off cocktail of grief and regret that I hadn’t known was still lurking there. In truth, it had been a few years since I felt much of anything at all.

And back along with it came that vicious thirst that had gripped me in my twenties. The buzz had long worn off, replaced with an evening hangover. How could I have been so stupid to pour that bottle of MacAllan down the sink? What was left in the cupboard now?

As I turned back toward the liquor cabinet, I heard a click and looked back to see my own gun pointed directly at me. Holding it was a slight girl, no older than 14. She wore loose sweatpants and a shirt with a picture of Ted Cruz reading “Not My President.” Though I couldn’t tell why, she looked oddly familiar.

“What were you going to do with this?” she asked, her voice shaking slightly.

“Nothing,” I said. “Nothing.”

She laughed at that. “You’re probably right. You’re an expert at that, aren’t you? Doing nothing.”

“Can you put the gun down?” I asked. “It’s making me uncomfortable.”

“Thing is, I feel better with it pointed at you,” she said. “And if one of us has to feel uncomfortable, I’m picking you.”

“What do you want then?” I asked. “Money? I can pay you whatever you want.”

She laughed again.

“It’s funny,” she said. “In some ways you’re so different. In some ways exactly the same.” When I didn’t respond, she continued. “I need you to drive me somewhere. Think you can do that?”

“Do I have a choice?”

“You do. But you’re not much of a risk taker, are you Steve?”

“Stephen. You seem to think you know me pretty well.”

“Better than you know, Steve. Now get the keys. It’s time for a road trip.”

A few minutes later we were on the freeway headed north. She sat in the backseat, gun in hand.

“So, do I at least get to know who’s kidnapping me?” I asked, trying to keep things light.

“Emily.”

“Oh, that was my mother’s name.”

In the rearview mirror, I watched her roll her eyes.

“So where are we going?” I asked after a bit of uncomfortable silence.

“To see my mother.”

My mind was racing now, pieces starting to fall into place.

“Maya Green,” I said after a few minutes. “You look just like her. I couldn’t quite place it before, but–”

“Just drive,” she said, looking out the window, but after a few minutes, she met eyes with me in the mirror and leaned forward.

“So to you… she’s an ex-girlfriend, right?” she asked.

“Yeah.”

“Engaged?”

“No. Almost.”

“What happened?” she asked. She was less taunting now, more genuinely curious.

“She got tired of me,” I said after thinking it over for a moment. “She said I was wasting my life.”

“Well, she got that right,” said Emily. “You know, I’ve been watching you for a few weeks now, and I’ve got to say, you are genuinely doing nothing with your time on this planet. Like, your biggest accomplishment over the last month is a grocery run, and I’m ninety-nine percent sure that only happened because you ran out of wine.”

“What’s it matter to you?” I asked.

She shook her head. “You’re right,” she said. “Just drive.”

I looked back at her, and a name my father once told me bubble forth from some dark corner of my mind.

“The Traveler,” I said. “Are you the Traveler?”

At the name, the girl’s face went white, and she looked away.

“Where did you hear that name?” she asked, but I didn’t respond. “No,” she said after a while. “Of course not. He’s… sick. Barely human. I could never…. Do the things he does.”

As I looked back, I saw a tear streak down her face. I might have asked why, but I was interrupted by my car’s navigation: “You have arrived.”

We walked to the sidewalk facing Maya Green’s house. Her last name wasn’t even Green anymore. The house was a classic Victorian, tastefully restored and painted in tasteful colors. Inside, light bloomed from warm orange bulbs and the sounds of laughter mixed with clanking dishes echoed out through the empty street.

A little boy, maybe six, was watching us through the window, both of his hands pressed up against the glass.

“You brother?” I asked, but Emily shook her head.

“No, I’ve never met him.”

“Should we knock?”

“We should get back. I just wanted,” she was crying now. “I just wanted to know for sure that she’s still here.”

“She’s fine,” I said. “Better than fine.”

“For now,” said the girl. “But it’s only a matter of time. He’ll come for her. Just like he came for mine.”

The drive back was quiet. I tried to start a few conversations, but Emily was in no mood. She tapped the gun thoughtfully against the window glass, contemplating her next move.

As we got home, I looked up at the house, studying its contours as if for the first time. I remembered returning from a trip to Europe as a boy to find it freshly painted, shining white and brilliant in the August sun. That same paint was chipped and peeling now, the whole thing gone to seed.

Then, as I cut the headlights, I looked up at the upstairs window and saw him for the first time. Just his eyes, really, staring cold and dead. He turned his head slightly, like a bird assessing a worm. I could tell Emily saw it too because she leapt out the car door.

She raised her gun and fired a single shot, shattering the window.

For a moment, the Traveler stood there, smiling at us through the broken glass. Then he took a step back into the darkness and was gone.

I was raised unconventionally. My family never subscribed to any brand of organized religion, instead seeking solace in abstract spiritual concepts. Some would call these concepts “New Age.” My mother would call them metaphysical.

I was a perceptive child; the kind who would see faces floating around in corners of my room, which I later learned were quite possibly spirits beyond the veil. I would have prophetic dreams, which would frequently and inconveniently blur lines between my sleeping state and reality. I would be visited in the night by curious otherworldly entities, and not all were friendly.

My mother, who I later in life coined as the “kitchen witch” of our family, picked up on these happenings rather quickly. She took great care to please the friendly spirits who visited me in our home, and even greater care to banish the unsavory ones.

Let me preface the following by saying this: I understand that there are non-believers and skeptics who will find all sorts of explanations for the first half of what I am about to tell you. Most explanations likely point to an overactive imagination combined with illness, and my family’s response to do what they did instead of rushing me to a hospital may appear to be dangerous, or even cruel. In regard to the second half of my story, if you have any logical explanations – please, offer me reason.

I was four years old when I was visited by a demonic entity who intended to take residence in my body. In a matter of hours, I went from being an active, happy child to being nearly unresponsive and physically paralyzed in my parents’ bed. I remember feeling as though there was a silent, vacant space within my body, growing ever larger as the hours passed by - and something both foreign and unseen was attempting to occupy it.

First, it began as a feeling of being watched early in the day as I played among the current bushes in the garden. Then, after dinner, I experienced a pain in my neck that quickly led to stiffness. Soon, I was unable to move my neck entirely. I complained to my mother who, at first, assumed I had been injured. As the evening wore on, the paralytic feeling in my neck spread to the rest of my body – down my arms, to my fingers. Down into my chest, and to my legs.

My mother first thought I had contracted the measles, or some other illness from which my symptoms were a part. However, as she observed my actions and sudden change in disposition, she suspected that something more sinister was at play.

As a child, I do not believe I understood much of what happened next. One moment, my mother was on the phone speaking with a man who’s voice I did not recognize. The next, a large, bearded man in a long, navy colored gown was in our home with my mother, speaking with her in the kitchen in a hurried voice.

The man emerged with my mother from the kitchen carrying a series of strange objects: a medium-sized rattle made of a whittled stick and buckskin, a variety of small bags containing herbs and salts, and a pair of large, black, shiny crow wings – severed from the crow’s body to which they previously belonged.

My mother, who has practiced an energy work called “quantum energetics” since the mid 60s, named this man as one of her previous colleagues. She asked me to be open and receptive to the “work” they were about to perform.

My mother sat at the end of the bed with her eyes closed, both hands on my feet. The large man stood towering above me, and soon began to hum in words I did not know. As he hummed, my mother joined him in the song. My mother began to move her hands up and down my body, hovering a few inches above my skin. As she did so, the man rattled and chanted.

After a few moments, he handed my mother the rattle, and began to sweep up and down my body with the two, large crow wings. Up and down, up and down, creating a whooshing sound with each pass. My mother flicked herbs and salts from the various bags onto me and around the bed.

Their chanting and humming song grew ever louder, and I felt the strangest sensation of tingling all throughout my body. I could not resist closing my eyes, and when I did – I saw her.

In my “mind’s eye,” as my mother called it, I saw a girl no more than a few years older than me. She was standing nearly 20 feet away in a dark blackness, with long, dirty brown hair and tattered clothes. Her jeans were ripped, and her pink and white striped shirt was stained and worn.

I heard the chanting of my mother and the man, sounding like they were moving closer, and then farther away, quickly transforming to sound like they were in a distant room. As they continued to chant, the girl’s eyes met mine. They were glazed over and white, almost as though she was blind – but I knew she could see me.

She looked right at me from across the blackness and began to make a series of strange faces, one after the other. Her mouth opened wide as her eyes opened wider. Staring directly at me, she stuck her tongue out, and then smiled a grim smile that did not appear human.

I heard the chanting continue, now accompanied by the beat of a drum. The chanting grew louder and louder, and the girl continued to contort her face into strange expressions, faster and faster. After what felt like hours, the girl finally began to appear as though she was also hearing the chanting.

She covered her ears, like she was hearing something too loud or too scary. She began to crouch onto the ground, hands covering her ears. She began to shake. Suddenly, from her crouched position, between the curtains of her long, dark, brown hair, she peered up at me with one last twisted smile and disappeared.

The blackness was the only thing I could see before me, and yet, the drumming and chanting continued, now sounding as though it was coming from within my ears. After a few moments, the girl reappeared, inches from my face like a mother playing peekaboo with a child, hands outstretched beside her lifeless face, eyes wide. “HA!” – was the sound that came from her mouth, accompanying the attempted scare. At this, she dissipated into a mist among the blackness.

Once this occurred, the blackness began to dissipate like my vision had been clouded by some foreign contaminant glazing over my eyes. The drumming and chanted slowed, and then ceased to a stop.

My mother and the man were standing over the bed, looking at me as if awaiting the answer to a question that I had not heard asked. The man passed the crow wings over my body once more, and I felt the feeling returning to my limbs. The stiffness in my neck began to loosen, and I slowly moved my head from side to side.

My mother let out a long sigh. The large, bearded man turned to my mother and nodded. They retreated with their strange objects back into the kitchen, and spoke in low tones, slower and less urgent than before. 

The large, bearded man left our house moments later, and my mother spent the rest of the night by my side in bed. The herbs and salt still littered the sheets.

Something strange had occurred that day, and I did not completely understand it until I was older. I was used to seeing odd things and people in my “mind’s eye.” It was not until years later that I would learn, while not successful at occupying my body, the small demon girl had not yet left.

…

I’m sorry.

I keep saying this.

I keep saying it out loud, and then typing it like it means something.

I am so fucking sorry. 


…


Before I write this, I want you to know I am currently sleep deprived.

I didn’t sleep at all last night, and I’m trying to write all this down before I go and see someone.

I’m not sure who the ‘someone’ is going to be. Maybe a friend, or my parents. A fucking psychiatrist—I don’t know.

Hopefully you will know what to do.

I don’t want to pile all of this on you. I just don’t know what to do myself. I’ve thought about it and tried to come up with some kind of solution, or maybe a way to prove that I’m fucking crazy and imagined all of this. I’ve been trying to figure out where I would put it, but again, I don’t know. Fuck. I don’t even know why I’m writing this. Nobody is going to believe me, and on this sub full of freakish encounters, I think this counts as one. 

I guess I should start by saying I already suffer from insomnia. I tried listening to podcasts, white noise, and even whale noises. According to pretty much every article on insomnia I can find, they’re supposed to be the solution. Well, they’re not the solution. If anything, they make it harder for me to sleep. 

So, I tried podcasts, but the talking just distracts me from sleeping and I end up paying attention to whatever is being said. White noise gives me headache and playing Netflix on low sentences me to night-long binges of reality TV shows. 

Nothing was working. I go on YouTube a lot. I watch videos before and after work and during meals, so it’s pretty much my substitute for TV. Like every other person my age, I guess. I watch a variety of things. Whether that’s movie reviews, cooking video’s or introspective video essay’s about everything from Sailor Moon to Gossip Girl. It was during my endless scrolling when I came across: “RAINY DAY IN OSAKA, JAPAN. (NO TALKING).

Curious, I clicked on it. I had always been curious about Japan. I have friends who want to move there purely for the food, and the culture, and I take a Duolingo class. It seems like a beautiful country, and the video showed me exactly what it said in the title, a real-life perspective of walking through Osaka. After sitting through that one, I found myself clicking on more. 

There was night and day, night-life, and rush-hour. I got sucked in. I wanted to know the lives of everyone who walked past the camera, every glance, whether that was a man, woman, or a child. I found it fascinating that I could be in my bedroom in the middle of the night, huddled under my blankets with my headphones on—and with the click of a button, I was on the other side of the world, side-stepping an old woman holding an umbrella or a dog walker casting a smile my way under blooming cherry blossom. I admit, I got addicted. Not just because they were fun and therapeutic to watch, but they also sent me to sleep.

These video’s were a blessing.

Last night was the usual. I curled up in bed and set up my laptop on my cupboard. I wanted something different, so I typed in “Japan” and “ASMR” and a dozen video’s popped up. Most of them were at a million views and were either vloggers or stream VODS. But one video caught my eye.

It was right at the bottom and was sitting at just over a thousand views. 

The thumbnail was a 1080P quality image of looming trees and darkness swallowing up whatever was in the distance. I recognised the name in the title. Until then, I had been avoiding video’s featuring the infamous Japanese suicide forest. 

The video’s I have watched are either incredibly insensitive influencer’s trying to make a “scare” for content, or serious looking docuseries following the history. The video looked like the usual. The title was in both Japanese and English: “Walking through Aokigahara forest at night (NO TALKING. 4D) and after hesitating for a moment, I decided to click on it and see what it was. The video, to my surprise, was almost two and a half years old. It was uploaded on February 9th 2020.

It had 2 likes—and the dislikes were hidden.

I clicked play and watched for a while. The video started with a POV shot of a small apartment with cream walls and rustic furniture. The camera man showed himself putting on his shoes and then his jacket and locking his door. The video jumped, then, to him getting out of his car and showing the parking lot in front of Aokigahara. It was perfect quality. I lay back and got comfy, satisfied with the crunching sounds of his boots on gravel—and then the thump, thump, thump of him walking up wooden steps. He did an immaculate job of showing everything.

I saw every moment in the trees and on the ground, skittering insets in the soil.

The sound quality was good too. I was listening to—the night. And the night sounded beautiful. So peaceful. As the POV trail began and the man’s breaths grew heavy from walking, I started to drift to sleep, lulled by the soft crunch of his shoes through the terrain. 

The shot itself was well lit with a flashlight, illuminating an eerie pathway through tangled branches which almost looked like they were coming out of the screen when he got close enough to one. 

At one point I had to blink rapidly to make sure he hadn’t shoved the camera into a tree, because of the maze of branches entangled, dancing in the dark. Aokigahara had always been at the pit of scary stories my friends told around a campfire, or legends and myths detailing supernatural goings on, as well as the very real tragic suicides the forest has become infamous for.

However, all I saw was beauty. I saw night in all of its vulnerability, allowing me access to every crevice of this tragically beautiful forest. At first, I couldn’t fall asleep. I was slipping initially, but I kept getting intrigued by the sudden snapping of branches and crunching growing louder—like there was someone behind the camera. When he reached a sign, zooming in on what looked like instructions detailed in hiragana and katakana, I heard something. It wasn’t the man’s shoes because he wasn’t moving. 

Before I could really think about it, though, he turned and continued on the trail. But he hadn’t gone far before that same noise. Footsteps. They were in the trees, at least three sets of them. The guy didn’t seem to notice and nothing else happened for a proportion of the video. I closed my eyes once again. For a while, I was drifting in and out, occasionally slipping back to consciousness to see nothing had changed. I was getting used to the sound of the man’s footsteps, before a voice. 

It came out of nowhere, and in the middle of Aokigahara at night, knowing nobody else would be walking this trail, my interest was piqued. The voice was a low murmur at first, more of a whisper in the tree’s easily mistaken for a breeze. Then, though, it was breaking the sound barrier, as well as the tranquil silence of night. A shiver crept down my spine. The voice didn’t belong. It didn’t make sense that it existed right there in the middle of nowhere, but it did. It was real.  

“Excuse me!”

The voice was a guy. My age, or maybe a little younger. He had an accent. British. Very British.

“Mate, do you mind giving us a little help?”

His words lingered in my mind for far too long.

Us?

There were more of them?

I stared at the screen and waited for someone to appear matching the voice, but there was nobody there.

The camera-man didn’t seem to notice, continuing on the trail.

“Hey. Look, I don’t speak a lot of Japanese, and—”

There was incoherent mumbling.

“…also, it’s my third time here, and I know I should be practically fluent by now but I’m not—"

The voice seemed to be lost in the trees, in wounded branches and brush. His voice was getting louder though, until I couldn’t deny its existence anymore—and a shadow suddenly bound out of the trees and stepped into the glow of the flashlight. At first, there was no discernible identity. 

The camera focused on a face lit up in saturation before slowly a person bled through the blur. It was a guy. Just a guy. I don’t know how to describe him. He had dark hair poking under a bright green hooded sweatshirt and freckles. He looked out of breath but flashed the camera a friendly smile. “Ooh, cool. What are you filming?”

The camera guy ignored him to my surprise. So, he stepped in front of the camera, offering a shy wave.

“Hi.” He said. “Look, I don’t really know how we got here, honestly,” He laughed nervously. “Japan is kinda crazy, right? You’re standing outside a bar one minute, and then you’re trekking through a forest.” 

Once again, he was ignored, and I could tell he was growing frustrated, but his smile only pricked wider. “Anyway!” Staying in shot, the guy cleared his throat. “We don’t know a lot of Japanese between us, and we were wondering if you speak English—and if you do that would be incredibly helpful, because reading the signs in this fucking forest is driving us crazy and we’re extremely lost, and, hey!”

Even I was getting irritated with the camera guy’s ignorance.

I understood language barriers, but surely, he understood at least part of what the foreigner was saying

“Okay.” Freckles blew out a breath. “You don’t understand what I’m saying, but if you could--if you could just stop for moment. We’re lost, and we could really do with some help. Like, seriously. We don’t even know how we got here, and—"

He staggered back when the camera man took a turn further into the trees. But the kid wasn’t giving up, I noticed. He followed, motioning for two shadows I could glimpse at the corner of the camera to follow. I started to wonder if the camera man was scared of foreigners, or if he just didn’t speak English. There was that, but there was also the possibility that he just didn’t want to talk to him. 

Freckles did everything to try and get noticed—and failed miserably every time. It was kind of entertaining. “Noah.” Another voice sounded—this time American.

I detected a southern accent in a tone which sounded far less chipper than Freckles. “Stop.” Another man appeared seemingly out of nowhere, joining Noah’s side. He was taller, a darker skin complexion, wearing a t-shirt with NSFW art on the front. “He’s not going to help us,” he said with gritted teeth. “Think about it. He’s a guy just casually cruising a forest in the middle of the night—and we’re random strangers. Of course, he’s going to be wary.” 

The young man elbowed Noah. 

“Besides, we haven’t tried my tactic yet.”

Noah rolled his eyes. In the exposure of the flashlight’s glare, I counted four freckles on each cheek.

“Oh, Jesus.” He groaned. “You’re going to get us arrested.”

“So? Isn’t getting arrested better than being stuck in a cursed forest?”

“It’s not cursed!”

“Then why are we stuck, huh? I’ve seen the same tree six times.”

“That’s an exaggeration.”

“You’re an exaggeration.”

“Your mom’s an exaggeration.”

Both of them scoffed and started laughing, and I found myself enjoying their stupid back and forth.

As their back and forth continued, the two followed the camera -man, occasionally diving in front of the camera.

“Okay, so.” NSFW guy joined the camera-guy’s side. “Do you have a phone?” He attempted broken Japanese, and his effort was pretty good, even if I couldn’t understand what he was saying. I think he was asking if the guy had a phone or something they could call for help with. He tried his best, but apparently it wasn’t enough. 

At that point, I was used to the camera-man’s response. Complete ignorance. He kept walking, his breaths laboured. I noticed the man was heading deeper and deeper into the trees. I was sure hikers usually turned around at some point, but this guy’s destination was anyone's guess. A third guy came into view a little while later, when I noticed a dip in the ground—far rockier and harder to walk on—but he was more subdued and kept to himself, only offering quiet laughs at Noah and NSFW. The mood, however, grew progressively sourer as their footsteps fell in sync with the camera man. 

Every so often Noah would start whistling, and then planting himself in front of the camera man. I could tell by the crease in his expression and the scowl in his lips, he was through playing around. Looking closer, and then pausing the video, I could almost mistake a look of feral desperation in his eyes.

He really wanted out of there.

“Mate.” He said, for probably the 3rd time. “This is getting ridiculous.” He choked out a laugh as the three of them followed the camera man, their frenzied footsteps crunching through the earth. “I mean, where the hell are you even going?”

“Hey, chill.” The soft spoken guy finally spoke in a murmur. “Poor guy’s probably trying to get away from us.”

Noah made a noise of protest, tripping over a branch. “What does he expect?” He hissed. “He’s completely fucking ignoring us! And what, filming some YouTube video? Is making movies really that important for this guy? Come on, this is so fucking stupid!”

The guy cursed when he fell back, regaining his balance at the last minute. “He’s like fifty.” He grumbled, falling in step with the other two. “What does he even need it for?”

The three of them continued like that for a while. They argued for and against attempting to grab the guy’s phone, but they ended up just following the camera-man, hoping he’d at some point acknowledge them. I understood they were lost and needed help, but part of me was screaming at them to just turn around and attempt to figure it out themselves. 

This guy just didn’t give a fuck, and clearly was on a mission they had no business joining. I realised that when they stepped through a small clearing, following the camera-guy. There was something hidden in the trees, and the closer the camera got, I realised I was staring at a small wooden cabin. It looked home-made and was dainty enough to be hidden in the trees, far away from the trail. When the camera man stopped for a moment, surveying a door made of planks, the three guy’s seemed to come to an abrupt stop. In the eerie glow of the flashlight, a wave of emotions washed over Noah’s expression, though I couldn’t catch a single one. 

His eyes, which until then had been almost permanently rolling in frustration as he spat sarcasm at the others—grew dark. Hollow. It was the kind of darkness I didn’t know or understand. Not the darkness enveloping the forest and sky, more of an endless stretch of oblivion which was inescapable. But as fast as it had come, the hollowness faded, and he shook his head. Noah pursed his lips and stepped back with a laugh. “Nope.” He said. “Yeah, no. I’m not going in there.”

He walked over to the door and pulled off a cheap looking sign which said, “Home Sweet Home.”

Noah rolled his eyes. “I’m not a fucking idiot. This shit in the middle of nowhere?" He waved the sign.

"Yeah, this guys definitely got skeletons in his closet.”

“Agreed.” NSFW muttered. His gaze was stuck to the door, his lips twitching. “We should… probably get going.”

The third guy didn’t speak, and I could barely see him—just a glimmer of dark hair and baseball cap behind Noah.

I watched him take several steps back, before gesturing to the others to follow.

“There’s nothing here.” He finally said stiffly.

Another American.

“We should go.” I could sense the panic in his voice. “Now.”

Noah laughed. “Well, duh. That’s why we’re going. Lighten up, would ya?”

The third guy sighed. “I’ll ‘lighten up’ when we’re far away from here.”

Noah saluted the camera-man. “Thanks for nothing, dude. You really helped. Good luck with your YouTube career."

NSFW scoffed. “Could have just told us to fuck off, but sure.”

The two of them fell in line with the third guy.

“What do you think he’s doing out here?”

“Dunno. Definitely shady.”

The three of them disappeared into the trees—and all I heard was their back and forth, and laughter before a sharp breeze drowned them out completely. Now that he was alone, the camera-man headed into the cabin. It looked as cosy as a cabin in the middle of the woods can look.

There was a threaded couch and a rug, and a small closet where he kicked off his shoes and pulled off his jacket, throwing them inside. Before he shut the door, I caught something, and the taco I had before bed crawled right back up my throat. Blinking rapidly, I paused the video and then I leaned in and squinted so I was making sure what I was seeing was really there. It was. I mean, I looked at it from every angle. I paused and played the video until I was absolutely certain. Underneath all the man’s coats and hats and shoes, was the NSFW sweater. 

I knew it was the same one, because the camera quality gave me that luxury. I noticed when he was wearing it, there was a slight tear at the bottom. I was staring at the exact same one. But that wasn’t all. When I really looked, when I dragged the video forwards and backwards, I was seeing converse caked in dirt, a baseball cap, and bright green hoodie. When I sat back, the world swam around me. I could have turned it off. I could have shut my laptop, gotten under my blankets, and forced myself to sleep.


But I didn’t.

I pressed play, and the camera-man headed into the tiny living area he’d made himself before kneeling on the ground, taking the camera with him. His fingers gripped at worn wooden planks and ripped them away, revealing a hole in the ground—and in that hole… plastic? 

I paused it again. The hole was filled with plastic bags. When I played it, however, and he started pulling them out revealing what was really there, my heart sank into my gut and my mouth filled with something acidic, something strong enough to trigger my gag reflex. I was seeing expensive leather combined with iPhone’s and passports. 

The man surprised me by finally making a noise; a sharp squeak of hysterics rolling off his tongue in panting guffaws. It was the sound of an animal before a meal—a ravenous growl, as he grasped hold of the pile of belongings, dipping his fingers in them and pulling them out, his laughter growing more and more horrifying. 

There was a point when I closed my laptop and buried my head in my knees. It’s not real, I kept thinking. It’s not real. It’s not real. But no matter how many times I lied to myself, I knew that what I saw was reality. I couldn’t help it. 

Now that I had seen traces of the truth, I wanted to know more. I wanted to know this man’s filthy secret. The video followed on as ‘normal’ with him sitting down and taking out a flask before swigging it. He started laughing again, and he didn’t stop until his flask was empty. I waited for him to do something else, but the video jumped.

It was bad editing, an attempt at stitching footage together. This time I wasn’t looking at his cabin in the middle of Aokigahara. I was in the same apartment the video had started in. Something ice cold slid down my spine when I recognised Noah, NSFW, and the nameless third friend sitting around a wooden table strewn with bottles of sake. The three of them were clearly drunk, but also bewildered and confused why they were even there. 

I’d heard about these kinds of scams. Tourists being lured into cult-like groups only to be scammed of all of their cash. This though, looked more personal. Like they were visiting the man. They looked out of place—three foreigners inside a quiet shoebox apartment. The third friend had glitter on his cheek from what seemed like a night out, and NSFW had a bath towel on his head.

Noah was frowning at something on the table.

I recognised it.

“What is this?” Noah picked up the same sign with, “Home Sweet Home.” in colourful italics. He turned around, his lips curling into a smile. “Hey, so when I turn 25, will I automatically just start to like these?” He waved the sign mockingly.

“No.” The third guy said through a mouthful of drink. He shot Noah a spiteful smile. “You’re a Gen Z. You’ll never change.”

“Good.” Noah dropped the sign. “I would rather die than live, laugh, love.”

“Fuck.” NSFW’s head hit the table. “I’m gonna be sick.”

Noah jumped up, grabbing a bottle of sake, and downing it like water. 

I winced when he pulled a face like he’d sucked a lemon. “We’re gonna get going.” He announced, desperately trying not to slur his words.

NSFW lifted his head. “Are we?”

“Yeah. If you want to get back to the hotel and not get murdered by our tour-guide.”

The camera man sat silently filming everything, and that only made me feel sicker.

When the footage jumped forwards again, the living room had a lot of- colour to it. NSFW was lying on his stomach, a knife perforating his neck, a seemingly endless stream of scarlet pooling underneath him and dripping onto the floor. This is the part I didn’t fully watch. Because I couldn’t. 

The act was showed in graphic detail, over and over again like it was meant to be showed to someone. Like this was someone’s punishment. In flickering shots only differential from the amount of blood on the couch and table, I saw Noah passed out on the sofa—his eyes opening, mouth widening, before the same knife which had butchered NSFW plunged into his stomach. Over and over again, like a fucking movie. The man didn’t stop.

He left the camera rolling until the two of them were masses of scarlet and bubbling flesh on a cream carpet. The worst thing is, I didn’t see what he really did to them. I only saw pieces. I just knew they suffered. 

I knew that the torture was endless until they begged to die. I was shown in glimpses. NSFW kneeling over Noah and yelling something, his mouth open in a silent, tragic scream.

I didn’t hear it. He muted them. He only showed what he wanted me—or anyone else—to see.

The soft spoken guy bled into the footage towards the end. I don’t think he knew. I think he went to the bathroom, or maybe to crash somewhere. His eyes, his expression, when seeing the scene in front of him will haunt me for the rest of my life. 

And this time the man didn’t take his time like the others too. The third friend dived over the couch and attempted to get to the other’s side, but the man grabbed his leg and yanked him to the ground—but he was ready, rolling onto his back and crawling, grasping at the fibre of the carpet, his hands pooling red from trying to staunch the wound in NSFW’s neck which was passed saving. I don’t want to type this, but I think the guy gave up. Something in him snapped, and he stopped trying to get away, only curling into a ball and attempting to shield the camera-man’s frenzied hits. He missed most of them, thank God. 

The psycho’s momentum was fading. When he realised he wasn’t going to get anywhere by stabbing, he grabbed the guy by the hair, wrenched his head back, and plunged the blade into his eye. 

At that point I finally threw up what had been burning in my throat. I didn’t need to watch more. I didn’t have to. But I couldn’t fucking stop. I couldn’t fucking stop, so what does that say about me? 

It was like being in a trance. The world around me didn’t seem real. I lost all sense of smell and touch. It was around the time the man filmed himself severing limbs in his bathtub when it hit me that this was for entertainment.

I didn’t know who’s. His, some sick bastard who had liked the video—but he had filmed, edited, and put this together for someone to watch. For someone to watch him stuff each severed limb in a blender and then pour into a flask. He filmed himself cleaning everything up and gathering belongings—before heading into his little cabin in the forest. 

The man stopped at a tree before emptying the flask. And then he did it several more times, and the more I watched, I could feel my brain starting to unravel, my body finally catching up to it. Finally, the man threw their clothes inside his closet, and stuffed their phone’s and passports under the floorboards. He started laughing again, more and more hysterically like a cartoon.

He walked out into broad daylight and inhaled, and then exhaled—and I swore I could hear voices.

“Hey! Excuse me, can you tell us where we are? We’re, uh—we’re kind of lost.”

“Hello. Dude, I’m talking to you.”

“You don’t have to ignore us!”

“Seriously? You’re just going to walk right past—hey!”

I was barely aware of the video once again jumping forwards.

It was raining, and the world was lit up in dulled blues and vivid reds. The camera’s POV was an alleyway filled with stores, crowds of people walking in groups or individually. The man stood under an umbrella. His attention was first on the ramen shop, and then a girl walking past clutching textbooks to her chest. Before it flicked to a group of people laughing and joking, some of them holding bottles. 

He seemed to be waiting for something. When the crowd dispersed, I glimpsed a familiar bright green hoodie. Noah, standing in the rain with his hood up, high fiving a girl with blonde pigtails and a wide grin. The two of them were talking, and they seemed close, his head on her shoulder. The girl said something which looked like “I’ll be right back” and wandered back into the bar, and Noah leaned against the wall and tipped his head back, frowning at the sky.

I already knew what the man was going to do. He did it in three strides, planting himself in front of Noah.

He something in Japanese, but when Noah frowned in confusion, his gaze no doubt wandering for someone to help him, the man laughed heartily.

 “Free drinks.” He said, and then he said it repeatedly until a drunken Noah's eyes lit up with intrigue. 

“Free drinks?” The boy's expression pricked—before the other two joined him. NSFW, and the third friend. 

They had no idea, I thought. 

The camera lingered on Noah's face, almost like a tease. He smiled, and the camera zoomed right into his mouth. Like this had been the punchline all along. 

“Well, who wouldn't want free drinks?”


…

After that, the video ended.

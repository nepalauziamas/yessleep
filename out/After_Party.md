CONTEXT: Last year, around mid December, I was invited to a wedding. One of my friends from school had invited the whole class to her parents' wedding. The after party was going to be hosted in a banquet hall. The area was quiet and there weren't many people in the streets. 


STORY: At the banquet hall, I notice that none of my classmates were there. It was only me. There weren't many people too. There was an estimate of about 6 families. The place was huge too. There were about 20 tables. There was a mini bar and a cafeteria filled with different foods and snacks. They had surely planned this to be perfect.

My friend had offered me and my family some food. My parents nodded and went to the cafeteria to grab some food. I wasn't hungry and told my friend I would eat later. My friend and I chatted. I asked her why there weren't many people. She went silent and told me there had been  argument. Before the event, the bride had an argument with one of her close friends. Most of the bride's friends had sided with her friend and turned against the bride. I don't know what they had argue about. 

Around 9pm, I had the urge to go to the bathroom. I entered the restroom and the first thing that catched my attention was the strange odor. I thought someone must've taken a shit, so I ignored the smell. I entered a stall and took a piss. When I got out, I notice some white fabric poking out from below one of the stalls at the end of the restroom. I thought it was the bride taking a piss and I didn't want to bother, so I washed my hands quickly and left. But something that I didn't understand is why the  bride would use the guest's restroom. There was an individual restroom where the hosts would usually use.

Anyways, a couple minutes has passed and I notice the groom getting worried. I asked my friend what was going on and she explained that her mom hasn't been seen since the last 20 minutes. I told her that I thought I had seen her mom in the guest's restroom. My friend and I headed to the restroom. The white fabric was still poking out and the odor was stronger. I had a bad feeling. We started knocking on the door, but no response. I told my friend I would hop from the stall beside it and into the stall that her mom was supposedly in and unlock the door. As I climb into the stall, my face grew in horror. There, laid the bride's lifeless body against the wall. The window was open too. My friend must've seen my expression and asked what happened. I entered the stall and unlocked the door. My friend screamed and started crying. Lots of people must've heard the scream and came into the restroom. Everyone was in horror. The police was called. 

After the incident, I was told by my friend that the person who was arguing with the bride before the event had come to apologize. She told the bride to meet her in the reception area since she wanted to apologize privately. When the bride entered, her mouth was then covered with a piece of drugged cloth until she had passed out. Since the reception area was close to the bathroom, the bride was dragged into the restroom. She was then stabbed and beaten up. The murderer escaped through the window. She was caught by the CCTV. She was put under arrested. My friend and I had been traumatized ever since. Whenever my friend talks about her mom, she starts tearing up and I start comforting her. I know my friend's mom's death has affected her a lot, but seeing a lifeless body has also affected my mental state. Sometimes, I'm scared of going to sleep and dreaming of it happening again. I'm never ever going to wedding.

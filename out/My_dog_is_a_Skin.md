 

After my sister's graduation, my father decided to buy us a german shepherd that was 4 months old at the time (we will call her carrot) anyways since carrot has entered the house she has been great… except when she isn't. You see normally she is fine but sometimes things are just off about her. The first things we noticed are little things like the fact that when she lays down she does it at an angle almost how a human would lay back on one arm. That's fine maybe she just is a bit different nothing too serious but this is hard to ignore when you take into account what's next, her eyes. There are so many things about them, firstly she holds eye contact for extremely long, and the deeper you look into them the more humane they are it's extremely weird but that's not it. It seems like when she's not sleeping if you look at her at all, she knows? Even if she doesn't turn to stare back at you, it's still obvious she can feel you whether her ears perk up or she changes the way she's sitting. But perhaps the weirdest thing about her eyes is how she uses them, you see carrot is the only dog I've ever seen actively use its eyes instead of moving its head. For example, if carrot is licking her paws laying down, her eyes are almost 100 percent guaranteed to be staring directly at you. This goes for almost any activity she happens to be doing at the moment. It almost seems as if she is trying to mimic what “normal” dogs do. 

We have had carrot for a little over a year now and for the most part, it's just been little stuff like that but recently she has been sitting by the basement door a lot and looking at us while we are in the kitchen so me and my sister jokingly mentioned how she's a skinwalker we said this as a joke of course but carrots ears perked up. Me and my sister noticed but as to not creep ourselves out we convinced ourselves we didn't. But we haven't forgotten, she hasn't forgotten. Ever since then she's made it almost obvious. Then yesterday i accidentally left her outside a bit too long and went to talk to my mom. Then we hear something outside the window, as we turn we see her standing up (leaning against the window seal) and looking through the window. She has never done this before and I'm not sure what convinced her to now. But last night was all the proof i needed. She woke me up whining which is carrots way of saying let me out right now or I'm gonna pee on the bathroom floor. So I caved and got up, but after a few minutes I went to let her in and I see her peeking around the tree I've never seen her go near. And how most animals' eyes have that weird reflection (which is already scary enough) her eyes were pure white. She immediately ran past me inside, her eyes changing back to the normal brown along the way.

But right now is the moment that scared me the most and for the first time since this thought entered my head, I fear for my life. I got curious and looked up just “skinwalker” on the computer everybody was sleeping and i got bored I guess. But as she's known to do, carrot is behind me and she was laying on my bed I didn't realize until I clicked a photo and heard my bed squeak. I spin my chair 180 degrees and BOOM her snout is 5 inches from my face looking me in my eyes but this time it was even more humane. Have you ever looked someone it the eyes and couldn't focus on an eye so you switch back and forth? That's the best way I can explain it. I spun back around in my chair terrified convincing myself it is just a coincidence right?  But no now the evidence is undeniable. As I sit in this dark room only illuminated by some led lights and a monitor, behind my monitor I see her shadow. Standing up and….morphing? As I write this I can feel her presence almost as she could feel mine, looking at me, A slight breeze on my neck as she gets closer until I can hear her every breath. I slowly turn to my right at a mirror. The same mirror that scared her when she first got here. 

I was right

Swear to God this is true. Wrote it for a friend:


I have something eerie to tell you that is legitimately weighing on me. It requires a bit of backstory:


When I was 10 or 11, I had what I can only describe as a prophetic dream. It was prophetic because it came out of the blue and it definitely happened. Until two days ago, I’ve never had a dream like it. 


In the original dream, I was sitting in the back of my grandparent’s church, watching a movie with the youth group on a huge (like 60”) CRT/projection TV. I look to my right, out the window, and I see a being in a hood that has a red fox mask that glowed in the dark.  


I turn back to everyone to tell them what was out the window to find that everyone and the body of the TV had disappeared. All that remained was what looked like a command prompt/terminal window (the size of the TV) floating in space. 


There was a cursor blinking on the screen, signaling that someone could type. The words “Losing Alisha” were typed out on the screen. Then the screen cracked, and I heard the sounds of metal and glass being broken and mangled and a woman screaming. 


I woke up sobbing. I remember being so scared in that moment that, during the walk to my parents’ room in the dark, I was shaking. I’ve never been so scared before. 


When I got to my parents’ room and got my mom up, I immediately started sobbing and babbling out about my dream. My mom remembers everything very well, because I’ve never been that scared and incoherent and generally wigged. I remember saying something like: “We have to tell her and grandma and grandpa that something horrible is going to happen!”


Within the next two weeks, while driving with her new husband at night, a semi truck driver fell asleep at the wheel and crossed over into their lane just as it was passing them.


Now, she didn’t die. But she was mangled mentally and physically. Not only was she crippled, but her brain function was decimated. She went from being the nicest and bubbliest girl in the world, to being MEAN and nasty to everyone. As well as generally becoming a person with severe brain damage. 


Now, my dream didn’t say that she was going to die. It said that we were going to “lose” her. Which I feel that we did. She changed SO much, like is common with traumatic brain injuries. 


Up until two days ago, I had never had a dream like it since.


So, two days ago, I pass out (after not sleeping for days, ran out of my meds and couldn’t get a ride to the pharmacy while they were open) while doomscrolling, and immediately have a dream that I’m doomscrolling in bed, unable to sleep. 


I look up, and outside my window is the SAME FUCKING FOX MASK staring at me. I stare at it for a few seconds, terrified, when my phone starts going off. Like the kind of going off when an emergency broadcast or Amber Alert comes through.


I look down and pick up my phone. It says: ~”RUSSIA HAS ENGAGED NUCLEAR WEAPONS AGAINST UKRAINE. THE US AND ITS ALLIES ARE LAUNCHING RETALIATORY STRIKES. SEEK SHELTER IMMEDIATELY. THIS IS NOT A DRILL.”


I wake up in the same horror that I did nearly 20 years ago. I didn’t sleep for 28 hours after that. 


You know me, I don’t believe in God at all. Despite literally having a prophetic dream, I don’t believe in anything divine. But that mask was exactly the same. The fear was the same. This is only the second dream in my entire life that’s ever impacted me this way. 


Sure, I’m off my antipsychotics. Sure, I have nightmares all the time. But I’m still shook. Skeptical, but nervous.


Notes: 

My grandparents were evangelical Christian pastors for 55+ years.

I wasn’t close at all to my cousin. We are only vaguely related.

(I am not sponsored by Roblox or copy-writing or anything, I'm just telling a creepy story that happened on it) One day I was bored and was looking online for games.

 I saw a game called "Roblox" and thought it looked fun so I went to the website (I was playing on my computer). I signed up and looked for games to play. 

A few weeks later I was obsessed with Roblox. My favorite game was TOH (Tower Of H3ll). If you play that game, you know that there's usually 20 people in each lobby (I think, there's at least a lot of people). 

Today when I played, no one was in the lobby. I thought that was weird but it was midnight so I just thought that no one was online. I played for a while and made it to the top. Once the timer ran out, the level reset as usual.

This time a person joined. I was exited because like I said, I was alone in the lobby. I chatted, "Hi!" and started playing the level. The person's user was a jumble of letters. They where the letters that are all cursed and stuff like this- 

&#x200B;

c̶̛̛̲͕̗̙͈̤͐́͑͒̾͋͗̀̉̑͜ų̷͇̼̗̮͈̱̾́͌͐ŕ̴̦͇̰͎͓̯̍̀͋̔̀͑̅̄̃͗̈́͘ͅs̵̨̨̠̺͎̗̠͔͐͆͒͑̏̾͌͜ẽ̴̗̻͕̝̱̘̗͎̭̠̤̼̭̜͆͒́̒̎̉͌̿͒́̈ḑ̷̨̩̜̪̭̳͚͖̹̹͈̇̃̔̋̕

&#x200B;

The person said, "Hͥ̽ͣ̃̔ẹ̿͋̒̕l̙͖̑̾ͣl̙͖̑̾ͣo̯̱̊͊͢ " I ignored it because I was playing. Then they chatted again, "D̶͔̭̪̻o̯̱̊͊͢ṇ̤͛̒̍'t̲̂̓ͩ̑ l̙͖̑̾ͣẹ̿͋̒̕ā̤̓̍͘v͒̄ͭ̏̇ẹ̿͋̒̕ " I got a chill. I tried to leave but it wouldn't work. Then the person playing teleported in front of me. Their avatar was all black. Then I was kicked. 

The creepiest thing was the reason why. " I̍̅̀̎̊ s̠҉͍͊ͅẹ̿͋̒̕ẹ̿͋̒̕ y҉̃̀̋̑o̯̱̊͊͢ư̡͕̭̇. y҉̃̀̋̑o̯̱̊͊͢ư̡͕̭̇ c͕͗ͤ̕̕ā̤̓̍͘ṇ̤͛̒̍t̲̂̓ͩ̑ r̴̨̦͕̝ư̡͕̭̇ṇ̤͛̒̍. y҉̃̀̋̑o̯̱̊͊͢ư̡͕̭̇ c͕͗ͤ̕̕ā̤̓̍͘ṇ̤͛̒̍t̲̂̓ͩ̑ ḣ̖̻͛̓ỉ͔͖̜͌ḑ̴̞͛̒ẹ̿͋̒̕ " I looked at the camera on my laptop. It had the white light on, showing that it's on. I immediately covered the camera with duct tape. I joined another game and forgot all about it.

After a few hours I closed roblox and shut off my laptop. It was 4am so I decided to get some sleep. I woke up the next morning to my laptop on. I was a bit creeped out because 1- I turned off my laptop and I only turns on if you hold the power button. 2- I closed it and it takes force to open, it can't open by wind or anything.

I walked over to my desk and was about to turn off my laptop when I saw what was on the screen. It was my Roblox profile. The user was cursed and glitched and my character was all black except for my outfit. I had around 200 robux and it was all gone.

 The most recently played games where all creepy games or games that only had few people playing. The chat was open and it was between me and the person I saw yesterday. The chats said something like- (M is me and P is the person)

M- Done

P- good job \*\*\*\*, time for the next part

M- ok

I relished I was hacked and Disabled all phone numbers and personal info from my account. I wanted to know the person who did it so I chatted the person from yesterday. I said, "Hey, I forgot somehow but who are we? I think I bumped my head or something" I thought it would be obvious that that was a lie, but it worked. "Again? you have to be more careful." P said. 

M- "Sorry"

P- "its fine"

M- "so who are we?"

P- "you're \*\*\*\* and i'm \*\*\*\*\*\*"

M- "those are some weird human names lol"

I regretted sending that, i knew I would get caught. Somehow I didn't but the next thing P said sent chills down my spine.

P- "We aren't humans silly"

I froze. Then what are the things I found? I messaged back.

M- "oh yea. What are we exactly?"

P- "I see you"

my heart stopped. Then I saw a face in my window. My desk was right next to the window. I jumped out of my chair in fear and grabbed my lamp as a weapon. The face was gone. 

I was shaking and my heart was pounding. I shut my laptop and ran to my parent's room. They where awake and watching tv. I ran in, panting and shaking. 

I sat down on their bed and told them everything. My mom told me to sit next to her in bed and my dad went to check outside.

 He came back looked horrified.

 He said that nothing was there but my window was halfway open, and the room was a mess. Written on my door in scratches was, "You can't run". I didn't want to go in my room alone so my parents came with me. Everything was normal and my window was shut and locked. I opened my laptop and my Roblox account was back to normal too.

I made a new account and I never play any games that have little or no people in it, and if I see cursed letters, I leave.

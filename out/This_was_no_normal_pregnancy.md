First of all I don’t know if this is the right place to post this but hello everyone my name is Tina I’m a residential nurse at garden grove hospital in Southern California even though I won’t be for long. Now I work in the maternity care section of said hospital, and I love my job seeing the relieved expressions on the parents faces when their baby is healthy is the most amazing feeling. However, I know I shouldn’t be telling this story but confidentiality be damned. Something happened at about 3 in morning on Christmas Day that will forever haunt me. Everything, started out normal enough lines going crazy nurses running everywhere when I see the infamous pastor Alonso and his wife Darcy being rushed to the nearest room. 

I’d be lying if I told you I wasn’t a little awestruck at the sight of them I mean the pastor is the face of the biggest mega church in California if you didn’t know. Anyway, I get paged to their room so to avoid the obvious nervousness wafting in the air of the room I strike a half hearted conversation asking them about the baby ask how their holiday evening was and such while I do my normal routine. I finish and tell them that the doctor will be in to check on them in 30 minutes, and as I pass the pastor I saw he was smiling from ear to ear but something about his smile didn’t seem right his teeth looked more like small daggers than regular teeth I blinked and the daggers were gone. I thought I was seeing things from the lack of sleep, but what happened after those 30 minutes was no dream and definitely happened. After the 30 minutes go by pastor Alonso screams for staff to “come quick!!” “He’s coming!!” I see doctor Micheal’s walk calmly into the room which I find strange while I jog into the room. Next thing I know, the lights in the whole hospital start flickering all while misses Alonzo is screaming in pain and pushing. 

Then, finally their baby boy is born but he doesn’t look normal he had pure dark black eyes his cries were much much louder and somehow deeper than any baby’s cry. I run to try and leave when pastor Alonso stops me with the sharp tooth smile and his eyes roll in the back of his head then they turned even darker black than his son’s it looked like a pit of disparity and nothingness where nothing could escape. He saw the desperation to get out of that room he said in a deep voice deeper than humanly possible “you’re not going anywhere sweetheart we haven’t even cut the cord” I tried to scream but I was too paralyzed with fear. Somehow I manage out a weak “who are you people?” The THING pretending to be Alonzo said “ Again with the same old questions. To put it bluntly I’m the devil and that there is my wife!” “Then that means” I struggle to form the words as I say them “that’s the anti-Christ!” “Ding ding ding!” The man claiming to be the devil said as if this were a game show. Now at first I thought it was all just a fucked up dream, but I knew it wasn’t because if it was I’d be flying out of that room. 

After all was said and done, mrs. Alonso held her baby boy in her arms not grasping the immense torture and pain he will cause mean while the devil wants to talk to me. “Wait!” I say “where did Micheals go!” In all this commotion Micheals had disappeared “don’t worry about him he fulfilled his part of a deal we made a few years back” he says with a haunting smile “so what’s gonna happen to him?” I say genuinely worried about my colleague “contrary to that fucking book of yours I don’t bargain for souls if that’s what you were thinking.” I did in fact think that “ I just did a favor for him and now he has repaid his debt ten fold with my baby boy” I grimaced when I heard that. I was still confused with what he wanted with me so asked “what brings me into all this?” “Well!” He answered “if I’m to be honest I’m not as powerful as I look I had a different nurse picked out entirely never occurred to me that she might have gotten sick” he said like he was annoyed at a little kid. 

All of a sudden, he turns to me and says “ but since you were in the wrong place at the wrong time so I’ll give you a deal!” “ it’s actually pretty simple you keep this our little secret and u can have whatever you want, Boy Scouts honor!” The devil put his hand up holding three fingers up like a Boy Scout. I be telling you a lie if I didn’t think about it, it was quite the offer, and I took it i would keep his secret in exchange he got me the promotion to OBGYN that I always wanted. The reason I’m telling you all this now is because I don’t know call it a guilty Conscience all I know is it’s been almost 18 years on the dot, and the end is coming.

This all started back when I was little. I grew up in a small town where it was frowned upon to be different. My whole family knew from an early age there was something off about me, I was always seeing things. At the age of 4 I told my mom that little people with hats (talking about gnomes) would follow everyone around yelling at them for the things they would do wrong. Being that my town didn’t like different my parents always told me that I just had an imagination in hopes that I would stop seeing and saying these things as I got older. However the older I got the worse it got, I started looking online and I seen all these different answers most saying that I was mentally insane and should be put away. I could never find any clear answers so I just stopped looking and lived with it. 


This is 8 years ago now. I’m currently 29 and have only been getting worse, I again turned back to the internet but found this group of people like me and we started talking and nobody else knew what was wrong and we were all looking for answers. We looked for so long that I thought it would just lead to another dead end so I left it alone for a bit. That was until one day when it was the worst it had ever been, I had walked into a job interview and seen blood dripping down the walls and dead animals all around as if there was a sacrificial ritual preformed there. I had completely lost it I had a full break down and ended up in the mental hospital. Thankfully I was able to fake it so well from being forced to my whole life I got out in a week. Once I got out I went back to the group and i found out that they had a testing lined up with a scientist that claimed he might know what is wrong. 


 
We all obviously wanted to know what was wrong with us so we all went and met this scientist. He led us into this lab and spent 2 months doing tests on us. Things like making us sit in chairs that monitor our brain activity and our blood pressure while we see these things. This one time he had us all take these pills to see if it would stop and it only made us worse. Finally after 2 months of tests and not leaving the lab we got our results. They were baffling to all of us including the scientist. It turns out we all have been seeing the world in it’s true form. The form everyone has been trying to uncover for so long and not one single person has been able to. So all those years we went not knowing what was wrong with us was really just us having a chemical in our brain that others do not. This chemical is one that the brain releases when your young and can see the world for what it is. It’s terrifying to think that we all seen this as a kid but some of us just never stopped producing it.

So, just another update on the rapidly declining state of things in the woods outside of Halmere. Last time, I lost Jess. This time, not even five hours after losing her, I lost the store. Forgive me if things get a little hazy from here on out, I’ve only just woken up at the hospital and I have incredibly limited time. I'm told they’re going to confiscate my phone soon.  


It began with a thundering bang that shook the store to its foundation.  


My eyes snapped open. It was late at night, long past midnight but nowhere near dawn. I launched out of bed but could barely stand as the building swayed. The birdcages that filled the room waved like water on the floorboards to the ebb and flow of the store’s seizure.  


“Save with Geico!” the feathery bastard was not impressed.   


And I couldn’t blame it, I was just as shaken as the store itself.  


I had no idea what to do in an earthquake. We don’t have them where I come from. But I figured my best course of action would be to get my bearings, so I staggered my way to the round window to the right of the bed. The sway of the birdcage tide was less than helpful, but I made it. And what I saw outside was bad.  


All hell had broken loose. Every monster I’d seen, plus a metric shit tonne I hadn’t. All of them, together, they were smashing their bodies against the invisible barrier around the antique store. Like some kind of hellish mosh pit. Even worse? It was working. Each heavy smash sparked a shockwave that rocked the cabin to its core.   


There was another thunderous boom, and my bedroom door swung open violently with a *BANG!*   


“Save with Geico!”  


The little feathery bastard was up in the air and out the door in moments, and I followed it. Through the hallway, past the dark and tar-like flood from the attic hatch, down the stairs, weaving through the mounds of junk we call antiques.  


I found Geico at the front counter, and I knew exactly what it was looking for.  


There’s a bottom draw on the far left of the front counter, and it’s where Jess kept the one thing everyone around here seemed to want. I reached over the counter. The drawer was already open. And the thing inside was bouncing around like a ball in a pinball machine.  


Inside the drawer was a crystal ball full of liquid darker than any Magic 8 Ball. Beneath that was a sticky note with four hastily written words on it.  


*THE STORE’S ALL YOURS.*  


Part of me wanted to avoid the thing because I wasn’t sure what it did. That’s just common sense. All the antiques in the store seemed to *do* something. It’s a crooked little store that refused to sell its crooked little things. But now I was certain of what this thing did. Because with each shudder of the store came a crack in the crystal.  


I scooped it out of the drawer as carefully as I could, given the quake of the store. If this thing was what I thought it was, then the last thing I needed right now was for it to shatter.   


Geico ruffled its feathers proudly. The feathery little bastard probably wanted some kind of praise, but now was not the time for that. I opened the front door and yelled out into the night.  


“Stop!”  


I wasn’t expecting much, I certainly wasn’t expecting it to work. But it did. The creatures all froze, transfixed by the thing I held in my hands. And I wasn’t sure whether to be relieved, or terrified that these things could now apparently see me.   


The store creaked and groaned as it settled back into place. But this solution was temporary at best. The orb was obviously important, and held some kind of sway. But in my hands, it was nothing but a child’s nightlight.   


At that point, I was honestly considering standing there all night. It was working so far. But that plan was ruined when the creatures started moving again. Not to attack, not to defend, not – and I say this with great disappointment – to leave the surrounding woods.   


The horde parted, like Moses and the red sea. But the bastard who waltzed with a spring in his step was no biblical prophet. It was Bundy. And he looked positively giddy.  


“Having fun, Chris?” he smiled.  


“Well,” I hated how faint my voice felt, and how little distance it seemed to travel in his presence, “If I’m being honest, not really.”  


He stepped across the white pebble boundary of the forest clearing, and stopped. The path that parted through the monsters of the woods was swallowed by the horde.  


“Well, I can’t say that doesn’t bring a smile to my lips. But it’s time to come home.”  


“Home? As in…?” I asked.  


Bundy’s smile curved into a sneer, “Where else?”  


“No clue,” I was stalling.  


Because I knew exactly what this was about. This was about a white picket fence, freshly painted over. It was about the rotting foundation of the wood itself, and the hands stained white by the discovery of it. This was about the mine.  


“I think you know exactly what I’m talking about,” I hated that shit-eating grin.  


Bundy’s steps were slow and deliberate. There was nowhere to go, the clearing was surrounded, and that’s how he’d planned it. My only options were to give up, or struggle. And I could tell by the look in his eyes he’d prefer the second option.  


He was almost at the porch steps now.  


“Ready to go?” he asked.  


“That won’t be happening.”  


“I’m afraid it is, bud.”  


His voice was patronising. His use of the word bud meant anything but. He took a step up onto the porch and-  


“Well, good fucking luck asshole.”  


I launched myself back inside the store; flicked the deadbolt, slid the chain, collapsed the pile of junk next to the door across the doorway, and took off running into the mounds. The store quaked. The mounds shook. I cradled the orb tight, shielding it from the junkyard debris that tumbled as the store’s collection collapsed around me.   


A thought struck me as I ran through the trash heap, it was a thought I’d had when I first arrived. This was the kind of final destination hoarder’s house that makes the news when the junk falls, and the hoarder’s body is never found. These weren’t just piles of junk. They were burial mounds.   


The front window shattered. Bundy’s voice chased me.  


“There’s nowhere to go, Chris!”  


And Bundy was right, but I wasn’t about to give him the satisfaction. I bolted up the shuddering stairs, three steps at a time. But something fast and solid struck me from behind as I hit the second floor. I tumbled, narrowly missing the flood – dark, and tar-like – pouring from the attic. My arms stung with the scrapes I earned in a desperate attempt to cushion the orb from the floorboards.   


“Ready yet?” he smirked, curtain rod resting on his shoulder.  


The bastard had hit me with a curtain rod. The fucking nerve. I rolled back to my feet.  


“That depends,” I replied, more confident than I felt.  


Bundy’s sneer faltered for a moment, “On what?”  


I didn’t answer. I stood at the base of the flood from the attic hatch; dark and tar-like. The same dark liquid that had wicked witched Agatha May in a single drop.  


Bundy’s face was twisted in rage, “What has someone like *you* so confident you can make a face like *that* in the presence of someone like *me*?”  


Weirdly, in that moment, there was complete calm. The store didn’t shake. Bundy didn’t move. Geico didn’t screech. Everything was still.   


And then a deafening boom tore across it all.   


And I could feel it. I felt the mounds avalanche, I felt the walls sag and the support beams crack, I felt the monstrous horde stampede into the clearing, and I felt the orb in my hands shatter. Fragments of crystal stabbed and slashed. And I bled; dark, and tar-like.   


I didn’t have time.  


The floor was flooded; dark and tar-like. And I wasted no time kicking the puddle up into Bundy’s face.  


He didn’t melt. No. He laughed.  


But I jumped in for a punch straight to his face and-  


“You idiot.”  


He swung the curtain rod down on my knee, and a pain unlike anything I’d ever felt racked my body.   


“You fucking idiot!”  


He swung again.  


“Did you really think.”  


And again.   


“I couldn’t do.”  


And again.   


“Anything you can?”  


He didn’t stop until the rod was bent into a useless curve, and my body was numb, and my vison was dark.  


“It’s time to come home, bud.”  


He reached down, grabbed me by the throat, and lifted. And my throat burned. Each breath was a struggle, each syllable was like acid.  


“N-no,” I choked.  


Bundy’s face twisted into a mask of pure rage. His hand on my throat shook with hatred. And he charged, slamming me into the frame of the round window in the room at the end of the hall.   


The smash, crash, and clatter of the rampaging monsters downstairs was the white noise to his voice.  


“This is not a negotiation Chris. There’s a debt you’re due on.”  


His grip tightened, tighter than tight. This asshole had no intention of taking me alive. I tried to break his grip. But my arms were numb, and heavy, and burning all at once. My fingers were stiff. I tried to break his grip. But every fibre of my being screamed.  


I couldn’t. The impact with the window frame had knocked the air from my lungs, and Bundy’s grip crushed at both my throat and my vocal cords. My vision was fogging, dark and smoky. Something smelled like burnt toast. I was drifting into the hot, hot afterlife I deserved. The last thing I’d see were those eyes full of rage, hate, and… surprise?   


Bundy’s grip softened for a moment. His eyes were wide.  


“You fucking psycho. When did you set this place on fire?”  


I had no idea what he was talking about. But I tried to suck in a deep breath, only to cough it all back up. The air was full of a thick, dark smoke.   


I only remember this next part in fragments.   


I heard a scream, “Chris!”  


But it didn’t sound like Bundy’s voice, and it wasn’t mine. I felt Bundy’s grip vanish. I felt my ass hit the floor. I heard the smash of the window behind us. I felt the glass shards rain down as I tried to bring myself to my knees, coughing and wheezing; brain frozen on the glimpse I’d snatched in the smoke.  


Long, dark hair and eyes that were almost certainly a colour.   


Jess? She’d tackled Bundy out the window. But that couldn’t be right. Because Jess was moving towards me through the doorway, the smoke swirling around her.  


“Chris?”  


This wasn’t real. I’d passed out. Surely.  


“Chris?”  


Jess slapped me. And it was undoubtedly real.  


“H-how?” my throat was shot, metaphorically speaking.   


She shook her head, and slapped me again.   


“Get up, idiot! You’ve got to go.”  


The smoke was thicker than any fog I’d seen. My head was spinning.   


She grabbed me by the collar and tugged me to my feet.   


“Monsters,” I struggled to cough a warning.  


“They’re not here for you.”  


She shoved me forwards, and I stumbled my way shakily out the room.  


“H-How?”  


“Focus on breathing.”  


She shoved again. But I resisted. The attic hatch was just above us.   


“Wait,” I wheezed.  


“You don’t have time!” she yelled.  


I knew how to stop the fire. I reached for the cord of the hatch to the attic. But at that moment, something solid – and, in my experience, curtain-rod-feeling – struck me in the back of the head.  


And everything faded into darkness.

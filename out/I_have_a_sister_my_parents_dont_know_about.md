Shirley endured a terrible illness.  It came on suddenly when she was only a girl.  One moment she was playing outside and the next she could barely walk to the bathroom.  Her body was weak and she was plagued with fatigue.  Her loving mother dressed her in a nightgown and laid her in her bed.

She was confined to her lonely room, staring endlessly at the wallpaper and chipped ceiling.  As time passed her muscles wasted away.  Her doting mother brought her meals, mostly soups and hot tea.  Her father could hardly stand to see her.  He was only needed for carrying the girl to the bathroom.  He averted his eyes and it did not go unseen by Shirley.

The room that was her prison was small and sparsely furnished.  She was not allowed electronic devices as the screens could hurt her eyes.  There was a plethora of books but Shirley was rarely strong enough to hold them up to read.  Most of her time was spent sleeping or gazing out the window.  The window was a bit high for her to see clearly out of but the sun was there.  Eventually she grew to resent that happy sun, taunting her with bright summer days.

Shirley longed for companionship.  Her mother always offered to stay but Shirley had never been close with her.  Instead, Shirley began to imagine a girl in the same predicament as herself.  A girl trapped in a bed.  Her bed.  But upside-down.  This girl was lying on the underside of Shirley’s bed, suffering the dark and dust.  She would make up little songs about herself and the other girl.

*Myself and my sister in the dark*

*Long to go play in the sunny park*

*My dark sister would smile and take my hand*

*And we’d never go back to that room again*

From beneath the covers of her bed, Shirley began to have full conversations with her dark sister.  She would spend the mornings weaving brilliant stories and the afternoons lamenting over their desperate condition.  One day her mother came into the room, a bowl of barley soup in her hands.  

“Who are you talking to?” she asked, sitting on the chair beside Shirley’s bed.

“Oh, no one,” Shirley replied, happy to have a secret for herself.

Her mother put the bowl onto the bedside table.  “Would you like me to feed you?”

“I think I feel able to today.”  Shirley struggled to sit up.  Her body was mostly bones now.

“If that’s what you want.”  Her mother got up and walked to doorway, glancing back once before closing the door.

Shirley frowned.  “She’s always making me feel bad.  Bad for being able to do things for myself.  I wish I could just get better so she’d leave me alone.”  She slowly reached out a hand to try and grasp the spoon when she heard something move beneath her bed.

She paused, trying to remind herself that she was alone.  But when she looked back at the bowl a black thing (an arm?) reached up from beneath the bed and knocked it to the floor.  Shirley’s breath caught in her throat.  

After some quick deliberation, Shirley decided that her mind was playing tricks on her and that it was not possible for someone to be living beneath her.  When her mother came back for the bowl she was upset to find the contents strewn across the floor.  

“Shirley, if you can’t eat by yourself, you have to let me help you!”

“I’m sorry,” she replied quietly.

“I’m going to get you more soup.”  She left in frustration.

Shirley sank deep into her bed, contemplating the situation.  The oppressively happy sunflower wallpaper loomed over her.  It felt as if it was coming closer.  Something rustled beneath her bed.  She held her breath, trying to listen as carefully as she could to the sounds.  A soft, almost inaudible breathing emanated from below.

Shirley’s mother came back in with a flurry of movement.  She took her typical seat beside the bed and put the bowl of soup down.  Without asking she shoved a spoonful of the hot liquid between Shirley’s lips.  Shirley gagged and spit it out.  Her mother glared.

“Eat the soup, Shirley.”

“Mom, I think there’s something-”

“Just swallow it and you can tell me after.”  

Shirley made an effort to keep the flavorless liquid down.  She was so tired of soups and broths.  What she wouldn’t give for a steak or a hamburger.  Her mother wiped her face and frowned.  She stroked Shirley’s hair sadly.  “What have you become, little flower?”

“Mom, I think there’s something under my bed.”

“Just spilled soup.  I’ll get it.”  She bent down and began to wipe up what remained of the soup.

“No!  Something is seriously down there!”

Her mother laughed.  “You truly are a baby again, aren’t you?  Shall mommy take a look and scare off the bad monster?”

Shirley stewed in her anger.  “Nevermind.  I’ll just rest now.”

“Good baby needs her nap,” her mother joked.  She whistled some children’s song as she exited, closing the door behind her.

Shirley sighed the deep sigh of loneliness.  She closed her eyes, attempting to sleep.  

Silently, she felt something pull at her covers.  The blankets slowly began to move off the bed.  Shirley kept her eyes shut, terrified.  As if egged on by her fear, the blankets were ripped from the bed violently and Shirley lay uncovered.  She tried to make herself as small as possible.  Cautiously, she opened an eye.

Crawling up the end of the bed was a girl made mostly of bones.  She had jet black skin and white eyes.  She moved as if in pain, pulling herself up and over.  When her hand touched Shirley’s leg she began to emit small waves of smoke, like she was being burned.  Shirley only felt an immense coldness.  The girl slithered over Shirley, laying herself down.  Her face was exactly the same as Shirley’s.

“Please, let me go,” Shirley whispered, tears flowing.

The girl looked up, also crying.  Her tears were a soft red.  “Po…shun…”

Shirley grimaced at the voice, which sounded exactly like her own.  “What?”

The girl moved her jaw around as if she had never spoken before.  “Ma…po…shun…”  Desperately she pointed to the door.  “Kill…Shirley…”

“Don’t hurt me,” Shirley cried, squirming beneath the monster.

The monster put her head down.  “Never…leaf…ing…”

Shirley did the only thing she could think of, she began to scream.  The girl’s eyes grew large and she rolled off of Shirley and onto the ground, skittering beneath the bed.  Shirley kept screaming until her mother came in running.

She looked at the blankets and Shirley’s terrified body.  “What happened, little flower?”

“A monster!  She lives beneath my bed!”

Her mother gathered the blankets and lay them back on her daughter.  “I think you might need something more to eat.  I’ll make you a fresh batch of chicken noodle.”

“No, I’m serious.  You have to get me out of here.  She said she was going to kill me!”

“Shirley Hardie Jackson, you stop telling tales.  I’ll send your father in to look after you while I make the soup.”  She shook her and turned to leave.

Shirley saw a black arm reach out from under the bed.  It pointed at her mother.  In a small voice it whispered, “Kill…Shirley.  Ma…po…shun…”

As her mother closed the door Shirley began to understand.  With this understanding came a wave of fear and despair.  She took a deep breath and pushed herself up to a sitting position.  Everything hurt.  She cleared her throat and asked quietly, “Are you trying to say ‘poison’?”

She heard clicks from beneath her.  “Yes!  Yes!  Poy Shun!”

Her father lumbered into the room, his eyes red as dark bags pulled them down.  He stood in the doorway, not looking at her.  Shirley glared.  “Do you know, dad?”

“Know what?”  His voice was weak.  Breakable.

“Do you know that my mother is poisoning me?”

He suddenly looked at his daughter for the first time in months.  The pain in his face was immeasurable.  “She said it was only for a little bit, so she could have her baby back.  She keeps telling me she’s going to stop.”

“You have to get me out of here.  She is going to kill me.”

Her father paused for a second.  Shirley imagined the thoughts that swirled in his head.  His love for his wife, his inability to give her another baby, his secret and his relief of finally being found out.  He walked to her bedside.  “Quickly, before she realizes.”

He lifted Shirley from the bed and walked steadily out the door.  Shirley looked back to see her dark sister, reaching for her, wishing to be saved as well.  “I’ll come back for you,” she whispered, hoping the spirit could hear her.

…

Years later, after the trial and the rehabilitation, Shirley re-entered her childhood home.  She could walk now but the poison had done serious damage to her muscles.  When she moved it looked like a monster might move; off-kilter and slow.  Her aunt was there with her, helping her go through the house to find what she wanted to keep and what she wanted to discard.  

As Shirley approached the door to her room she turned to her aunt.  “I’d like to go inside alone if that’s alright.”

“Of course, sweetie.  I’ll be right out here if you need me.”

Shirley opened the door and was immediately accosted by the sunflower wallpaper.  How many times did she count those flowers?  How many hours were spent in agony, trapped in that room?  She walked to the bed and sat upon it.  The mattress was so familiar.  She bounced a bit, a smile slowly making its way to her face.

“Are you here, sister?”

Only silence responded.  

Undeterred, Shirley swung her feet.  She lowered one hand so that it hung off the bed.  The ability to move freely was so foreign to this room that it creaked in confusion.  Softly, Shirley began to sing.

*Myself and my sister in the dark*

*Long to go play in the sunny park*

*My dark sister would smile and take my hand*

*And we’d never go back to that room again*

A dark hand reached out and took Shirley’s, holding on tight.  Shirley could not contain her joy.  Her sister crawled out from beneath the bed, able to move so much easier now.  She stood, locking eyes with Shirley.  [The smiles echoed on each other’s faces.](https://www.facebook.com/EZmisery)

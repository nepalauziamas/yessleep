I finally got my ticket to a new movie at this newly renovated cinema from back in the day. It was "supposed" to be a life changing experience because of the interior apparently making you feel as if you were back in the 1920's. It really delivered on that premise since even the staff wore fancy uniforms, alongside being extremely charming and one even ushering me to my seat.

The entire auditorium was dimly lit in a hue of soft maroon, empty red velvet seats covered the entirety of the room, its ceiling resembled a dome and I was in awe. Not long after admiring the grandness of this place's architecture... the lights slowly dimmed down until it was dark. I get comfortable and wait for the movie to begin but there was nothing on the screen. Noticing the entrance door was still open, I decided I ought to go and ask the usher. But as soon as I got up, the door slowly closes with a soft echoing click at the end, then a text appears on the screen that read "100 year Grand Reopening!" followed by the usual movie trailers and ads.

As the screen lit up the room, I look around and noticed I was completely alone. Can't say I didn't feel lucky but there was something ominous in the air that didn't sit well with me. Time passed seemingly unnoticed and the movie ended. Puzzled, I try to remember when exactly it began or what it was even about but I had no idea. I grabbed my phone but it wasn't turning on so I just figured I should head home, which was easier said than done.

I walked the same hallway I was ushered through but it somehow kept going. I don't remember it being such a long walk so I tried retracing my steps back to the auditorium I left. The door was locked and so were the others. At this point I started feeling nervous and went to the restroom in my view. Getting closer to it, I noticed there were no assigned genders but only an infinity symbol on each side. I quickly splash my face with cold water thinking I may just be exhausted from all those late night shifts at work but that wasn't the case at all. A loud and ear piercing sound of a trumpet sounded out of nowhere which made the entire building rumble.

Sprinting to the restroom's exit I realized that the colors of the hallway's interior changed, red carpeting somehow turned green, brown walls turned a blue-ish grey and even the art on the walls were mirrored and color's inverted. The only thought going through my head was to run so I just bolted into the never ending hallway until I was out of breath and exhausted. Looking around again I saw what I assume to be an emergency exit but even the only thing identifying it was another infinity symbol, "fuck it" I said to myself and I went down another never ending hell.

Opening the doors I saw lead to the same hallway, time and time again. From little to major unique variations, it never stopped. Losing track of time, I thought about anyone ever finding me, at some point I even forgot my name... my real name anyways. With how fluid time was in this place, I saw my reflection in the restroom's mirror, I must've aged 10 or 20 years but I didn't feel it. Nor was I ever hungry or thirsty... couldn't even remember the last time I slept. Leaving the restroom, I came face to face with a mannequin wearing the same uniform the usher wore that dreadful day.

As if out of instinct I decided to wear it. The faceless and sexless mannequin suddenly sprung to life and pointed me into the direction of the emergency exit. I faced it with a dejected look, went down the stairs and opened the first door I saw. A blinding light made everything blurry for a moment until I was able to focus and look around.

One couple came up to me and asked where their movie was being played. Something inside of me compelled me to usher them to their seats without even looking at their holo-ticket. It's as if I knew everything about this place. While standing outside the auditorium I heard one of them walking towards the door and I gently closed it with a soft push.

Immediately after hearing that click I started feeling cold and I could see my skin losing its pigmentation, hair and teeth falling out, my screams slowly being muffled by my closing mouth and then darkness.

Now there's no sound or smell or taste but only my thoughts and memories till who knows how long. Remembering every bit of time I spent in this infinite cinema...

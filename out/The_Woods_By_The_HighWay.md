I remember driving on the highway with my mom as a little kid looking at the woods.
I remember that there were very few trees in the front but the farther back u walked the more trees there were.
I also remember that old tree house.
It had a door facing the highway with an old ladder that looked like I could break apart any second.

I remember always seeing a face in the window of the tree house.
But I would brush it off because kids all imagine things...right?

I drove past there recently...curiosity got the best of me.
As a kid I always wondered what was in that tree house.
So I decided to finally fulfil my childhood curiosity and go inside.
I parked the car near an old shop and started walking along the rail of the highway till I reached the woods.
U could only see the tree house at a certain angle.
Im surprised little me was able to spot it.

I started to walk down the hill sperating the highway and the woods.
Almost falling down it during the process.
I reached the woods and I suddenly felt like someone was watching me.
I didn't know why.
But I brushed it off...that was my first mistake.
I didn't know why I didn't turn back.
But I soon started walking into the woods.

The feeling grew stronger as I walked farther into the woods.
Till I stopped as the ladder of the old tree house was right infront of me.
I grabbed it expecting it to fall apart since it was so old.
But it didn't,it surprised me by how strong it felt.
So I decided to start climbing it.
I reached the top of the ladder and pulled myself into the platform around the tree house.
The door was an old wooden door the wood on the door matched the tree house.
I went to turn the door knob.
But I froze...I felt like someone was still watching me.
I should have turned back around.
I should have.
But I didn't....I opened the door and froze.

I saw two piercing mud brown eyes staring at me.
I couldn't even scream I was so scared.
But I didn't have time to react when it grabbed me by arms and threw me inside.
I tried to scream but it knocked the wind out of me...all that could come out of me mouth was a short a wheezing sound.
I saw it grab something off the floor and walk towards me with it.
I sat up and backed myself into the wall.
Then it hit me with it.
It didn't knock me out.
It made my vision go hazy and my head bleed tho.
That's when I noticed that there were bugs of some sort everywhere.
I never seen any big like them.
But before I could take a closer look at them I felt one jump on me.
It started digging into my skin.

Then I felt one on my cheek I tried to smack it off but it was already biting into my cheek.
I soon felt it inside my mouth.
Then another one jumped then another then another till they were all over me.

I saw the person staring at me watching...
That's when I noticed the bugs crawling out his mouth...
The last thing I noticed before I blacked out was the several skeletons on the wall...

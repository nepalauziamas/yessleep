My cousin Sheila is dead and they thought it was because of a boating accident

Sheila was super excited when I announced to her that we are going on a trip to the bahamas alone. As soon as I announced the trip, she thought things we can do or see in the bahamas. As she kept talking, I put on a fake smile and continued listening.

Sheila was intelligent and mature as a kid, as I was the opposite with low grades and a stupid mind. Since we had nothing in common, we never got along 

As soon as she skipped 3rd grade, all hell broke loose. My life was nothing but comparison after that. "Jamie,why can't you be smart like Sheila" or "Jamie, how come Sheila got better grades then you"?those were only the common ones mom said to me

And then when our aunt got a divorce, she went and stayed with us for a year, and then things just got worse from there. Sheila would taunt me saying that I am stupid and I won't ever have a life with that retarded mind of yours. And when I told aunt or mom, they would just respond with "stop lying Jamie, Sheila's only 10 ,She would never say those things"

To make things worse, mom didn't even pay attention to me. She made everything centered around Sheila. When I won the school science project, she didn't bother noticing me because Sheila got student of the month, again.

When I turned 21, Sheila accused me of rape. Which made my life hell. And since everyone believed her, I was sentenced to 5 years of prison. 

I wasn't allowed any jobs after my life was nearly was ruined, but I managed a job as a janitor, which I then saved up for our fun bahamas trip

I tried to gain my relationship with Sheila, which she accepted. But it was only apart of the plan

I also planned the weather patterns for our trip so I can get the evidence to sink to the ocean floor

As soon as we got on the boat, she complained about how hot it was or how our food was soggy, it only aggravated me more on killing her.

As soon as I saw the storm clouds rolling in, I knew it was time. 

I told her we can take a dip in the water and that she could go first so I can get something, but as she went through the back ladder, I reversed into her and in mere seconds, her faces was into shreds. I had heard a couple seconds of muffled screams until I went to take a look.

I was happy to see her shredded face floating face up in the water. Even thought it made me happy, there was a lot of blood on the boat, and I couldn't just return it bloody.

Before we went, I bought a hammer from a local workshop. So I brought out the hammer, slammed 8 big holes in the boat, and before wayer flooded the inside of the boat, I stuffed Sheila's body so she can sink with the boat.

I took out the floatable lifeboat from the closet before the boat sank, so I inflated it, and as soon as the boat sank, the storm rolled In. As the violent winds and rain hit, so did the rain.

I don't remember much after the storm because I was so hot and tired and dizzy. all I was told is that it took 3 days to rescue me.

I then woke up in a hospital, where I still am now. I was asked what happened to Sheila and how you survived and she didn't l, it proved to show that mom or aunt didn't care for me.

It was then pronounced as a boating accident and "how 2 cousins didn't know what was coming" I'm glad I got away with it and how it worked out nicely.

Soon, I'll come for mom and aunt, and blame it on "accidents" with my misfortune 

I'll see you at Sheila's funeral mom.

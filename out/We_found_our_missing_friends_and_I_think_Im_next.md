I'm writing this with shaky hands and honestly I think I'm in shock but I feel like writing this out will help me clear my head and think logically about my next move.

Yesterday I received a call from my closest friend. To clear things up going ahead, there's a group of us, we have myself and Ross who is my closest friend, then theres Jack and Craig who aren't as close to me but we're all friends with each other.

As I say I received a call from Ross, it was about how he saw a facebook (Meta?) post from Craigs mother asking if anyone had heard from or seen Craig. myself and Ross were with him last night, we had met Craig at a parking lot and spoke from our cars for a while before he had to head home for work in the morning. That was the last either of us heard anything from him.

His car was missing, he never went home that night either.

Myself and Ross decided to go out after work and drive around our local area taking every single potential road home from the parking lot, but we didn't find anything, it was getting late so on the way home we phoned Jack and he said he was going to go out and look when he finished his shift, it was late at this point and we told him to drive safe and to call us if he finds anything.

That was the last we heard from Jack. We tried calling him over and over the following day, we went round to his place, the car wasn't there and he wasn't either. We were on edge but Jack is a bit of a rogue and has a habit of not answering calls and texts, one time we went out for drinks and within 15 minutes he was nowhere to be seen for the entire night, never even saw him the rest of that week, this isn't exactly out of the ordinary where he's concerned.

Again, myself and Ross went out to look for Craig, it was darker than usual at this time, it wasn't feeling like your standard summer night. I don't know how to describe it but everything felt off, maybe its nerves due to the circumstances? Not knowing what you're going to find? Maybe it's the fact that we might not find anything at all.

It was very dark along the single-track road when we spotted it, Craigs car. It was a steel grey colour, Fairly off track, he didn't crash but it looked as if he drove between the trees and carefully maneuvered his way off the track into the woods, maybe at most 20 yards off the road?

We parked our car at an angle just off the road so we could light it up as we walked over. The image of what was inside the car will never leave my mind till the day I die, even then I fear it may still haunt me.

Jack and Craig were in the car, they were sitting calmly, the same way you might sit in the car when waiting for someone. The haunting part was their heads, sitting on each of their laps. I was speechless, I literally couldn't get the words out but at the same time it felt like a joke, a sick prank of some sort, it just didn't feel real. Ross was in hysterics, mouth wide open with no sound coming out, like a silent scream, still in disbelief I reached to open the car door until my phone started ringing.

The caller ID read "Craig"

At that point I was hit with a feeling, this was more of a feeling of someone else being there with me and Ross, I don't know how to describe it but the mixed feelings of fear and disbelief were almost gone, this was just a pure rush of fight or flight. Gut instinct of LEAVE NOW. I showed Ross my phone, we looked at each other and both ran back to the car and took off.

The drive home was silent until he was parked outside my house and we just agreed that we need to let the authorities know and that we'll talk about this in the morning because it was too surreal in the moment, I said I would call them once I got in the house and had a few minutes to really let everything sink in. I got my phone out to make the call and I got chills, going to unlock my phone I noticed the LED light blinking blue, this can only mean one thing

"Missed call from Craig (58)"

I swiped away the notification and instantly began to call the authorities when my phone started ringing again, the vibration felt intense as if my phone was angry at me. Truthfully I was scared, I didn't know what to do, I switched off my phone and decided to just wait a while. As much as I wanted to answer the phone, I didn't really want to hear who or what, was calling me.

I didn't sleep at all, I logged on to my PC and decided to play some games, multiplayer ones, mostly so I didn't feel alone. I knew I wasn't alone when I heard a knock at the door, it was 2am. I froze in place and then I heard it, the handle was rattling, whoever was knocking was also trying the handle. This was 3 hours ago and I haven't heard anything since.

I can't help but feel like I'm next.

If I can, I will post an update tomorrow at some point.

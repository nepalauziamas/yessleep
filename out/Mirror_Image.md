Something that might be important for me to tell you up front is that I’ve never had a ton of friends. I have, like, one good friend. And she lives a few hours away. I’ve never been part of group chats or girls’ nights out. 

&#x200B;

I don’t hate it but I kind of hate it. Especially when there’s something in my life I want to run by someone to see if I’m overreacting or not. I can always call Beth. She’s amazing. But sometimes I don’t want to bother her with all of my shit so I talk to myself instead. 

&#x200B;

Tonight was one of those nights where I needed a friend to vent to but didn’t want to bug Beth. 

&#x200B;

So picture me, makeup sloppy from crying after another terrible day at my dead end job. Fully drunk. Half full glass of red wine in hand. Pointing at the mirror as I yelled at myself.

&#x200B;

“And another thing! How could you forget how important it was to include graphics in your presentation! No one wants to read your bullet points of text on a blank white page Julia! You need to get your act together! How many times have you been told by your boss that you need graphics! You’ll be lucky if you don’t get pulled into his office and put on another project when you go in on Monday.”

&#x200B;

Fat, hot tears rolled down my cheeks. That would be humiliating. The presentation had been humiliating. My cheeks had been burning hot by the time I had finished and realized how many things I had forgotten to put in.

&#x200B;

I closed my eyes. I needed to do something else with my life, I wanted to. But there was nothing I was actually good at. Not that I was great at this job either. 

&#x200B;

“I’m worthless.” I whispered tasting the salt from my tears as I opened my mouth to let the words out.

&#x200B;

“Jesus that’s pathetic.”

&#x200B;

I whipped my head around. 

&#x200B;

No one in the bathroom. No one at the door. No one by the window, although I was in an apartment on the fourth floor so that would have been a stretch.

&#x200B;

A knock caught my attention.

&#x200B;

The mirror.

&#x200B;

My reflection waived at me. Reflection might have been a stretch if it was no longer reflecting me I guess. 

&#x200B;

I screamed, threw my wine glass at the mirror and ran. 

&#x200B;

I fell asleep on the couch with a baseball bat hugged to my chest. I awoke in the morning, sober and hungover and realized that the wine may have been messing with my head. 

&#x200B;

I vomited in the kitchen sink so I could avoid the shattered glass in the bathroom. I’d just woken up and I’d already made a mess of my weekend. I let myself sulk for a bit on the couch with some orange juice before putting on shoes and making my way to the bathroom to clean up the mess I had made. 

&#x200B;

“30 years old and hungover and alone on a Saturday morning. Ridiculous.”

&#x200B;

“Serious question though, are you ever nice to yourself?”

&#x200B;

My eyes shot to the mirror, sure enough there was not me. She waived.

&#x200B;

“Try not to run screaming this time. I’m surprised your neighbors didn’t show up.”

&#x200B;

“I didn’t scream. And I think I’m hallucinating.”

&#x200B;

“I don’t think it will help if I tell you that you’re not. But you’re not hallucinating.” She winked.

&#x200B;

I wanted to vomit again. I was pretty sure that I was going to.

&#x200B;

“Careful now. You look pretty pale and there’s glass over by the toilet so if you’re about to puke again sweep that up first.”

&#x200B;

I took a few steps to look and she was right, a mess of glass and congealing wine littered the area. 

&#x200B;

I ran back to the kitchen to vomit in the sink again.

&#x200B;

“She’s not real. I need to make a doctor’s appointment because I am seeing and hearing things. Do not talk back to the hallucination.”

&#x200B;

“I can hear you, you know!” the mirror lady called from the bathroom.

&#x200B;

“That’s because you’re in my head!” I yelled back.

&#x200B;

She continued to talk to me as I cleaned. I did my best to tune her out.

&#x200B;

“You know, if I’m not real and you know I’m not real then it's not going to hurt anything if you just talk to me.”

&#x200B;

“I’m pretty sure that embracing a conversation with my hallucination would be an issue.”

&#x200B;

“Why?”

&#x200B;

“I’ll be telling my brain that I think you’re real. Whereas if I ignore you, then you’ll go away.”

&#x200B;

She laughed. 

&#x200B;

“I’m not going anywhere, real or not.”

&#x200B;

I put a blanket over my mirror when I was done cleaning. I only took it off on Monday morning to do my makeup.

&#x200B;

“Looking good! Go for the bright red lipstick today, it’ll look powerful.”

&#x200B;

I tried to ignore her but still put on the lipstick she suggested. I covered the mirror back up without responding.

&#x200B;

We kept this pattern up for two weeks. I ignored her. She would make encouraging comments. She wished me luck for my presentation. She asked me about my day. She told me I needed to get more sleep. I ignored her. 

&#x200B;

I had become pretty ok with how things were, and hadn’t gotten around to calling my doctor like I had told myself I should. 

&#x200B;

Like a frog in a pot of water. I told myself all sorts of things. It was a weird hallucination. It only happened in my bathroom mirror at home. It wasn’t hurting anyone. It made my skin crawl at first but it wasn’t like a horror movie where she was making hateful comments, she was kind of nice really. Nicer than I was to be honest. 

&#x200B;

And then, my boss started hitting on me at work. He’d made some flirty comments here and there before but I had dismissed it since he treated most of the women in the office that way. It wasn’t ever anything over the top. Most of it could be dismissed as just really friendly. But this was something else. 

&#x200B;

I poured a giant glass of home as soon as I was in my kitchen. Heels kicked off next to the couch. Face painted red in anger.

&#x200B;

I sat down on the bathroom countertop and pulled the blanket off.

&#x200B;

“Can we talk?”

&#x200B;

“Anytime you want. You ok?”

&#x200B;

She sounded legitimately concerned. Or I had made the voice in my head sound concerned? One of those. I took a sip of my wine and told her the whole story. 

&#x200B;

“And then he ‘accidentally’ brushed my boob with his hand!” I said, air quotes on accidentally. 

&#x200B;

“What a jerk! What did you say? Did you tell him off or just go straight to HR?”

&#x200B;

I looked down, embarrassed.

&#x200B;

“Neither, do you think I should? I just wanted it to go away.”

&#x200B;

“Of course you should stand up for yourself! Problems don't just go away because you ignore them!”

&#x200B;

“I wouldn’t even know where to start. What if they don’t believe me? What if he lies or it really was an accident? I’ll look foolish.”

&#x200B;

“What if he’s doing this to other women? And all of you are sitting at home worried that no one will believe you? Predators don’t do things this blatant if they haven’t been getting away with it privately for a while.”

&#x200B;

I hesitated.

&#x200B;

“Would you like me to help you?”

&#x200B;

“You can do that? How?”

&#x200B;

“If you let me, I can switch places with you. Once I make the report, we would switch back.”

&#x200B;

A tingle went up my spine. A warning. 

&#x200B;

“I don’t know.”

&#x200B;

She smiled.

&#x200B;

“That’s ok, it's only an offer to help. You never have to take it if you don’t want to. But you need to go in and file the report either way.”

&#x200B;

I nodded. She was right.

&#x200B;

Monday came through and Monday went. And I didn’t file the report. I was nervous to talk to Mirror Me and admit what I hadn’t done to her. I went to a hotel for the night instead. I would file the report on Tuesday and go home and tell her then.

&#x200B;

On Tuesday, my boss ran his hand down my ass. Another ‘accident’. I went home with anger and shame at war in my blood.

&#x200B;

The woman in my mirror waited for me to speak when I walked into the bathroom. Arms crossed and a frown twisting on her lips. 

&#x200B;

“I need your help. He did it again and I need to do something but I keep freezing up.”

&#x200B;

A gentle smile painted her face.

&#x200B;

“In the morning, we’ll make the switch.”

&#x200B;

I nodded and went to bed. 

&#x200B;

Wednesday morning, I went to her as soon as I woke up to see what needed to be done.

&#x200B;

"It's really easy, honestly. Just a bit of blood."

&#x200B;

My expression must have made clear what I thought about that.

&#x200B;

"Just a really small bit. Cut the tip of your finger and swipe it across the mirror."

&#x200B;

What was a few drops of blood in the long run? I was about to switch places with a woman who either lived behind a mirror or in my head so that she could file a complaint against my pervert boss because I couldn’t do it myself. 

&#x200B;

The blood was the least of my problems.

&#x200B;

"What will it be like for me while I'm in the mirror?"

&#x200B;

"Like no time passes at all. The passing through will likely be tiring for you so you'll go to sleep and then I'll switch us back."

&#x200B;

I made a quick cut and wiped my finger on the mirror. For the first time in a long time, the image in the mirror moved as I moved. There was nothing at first. Then my finger tip started tingling. The feeling spread slowly to the rest of my body. Then darkness.

&#x200B;

It felt like I had only blinked my eyes before I found myself laying on my bathroom floor. The window was open and it was dark out.

&#x200B;

I was in a red dress that hugged my body in a way I was uncomfortable with. I bought it because it was completely gorgeous. But when I went to put it on to wear it out I felt like I was trying too hard. So I'd changed and never put it back on. 

&#x200B;

My head was pounding as well. The cost of doing business I supposed. I had a churning feeling in my gut that I might have made a mistake.

&#x200B;

“Good! You’re awake!”

&#x200B;

I glanced up at the mirror and the other me waved cheerfully.

&#x200B;

“How did it go? How long have I been laying here?”

&#x200B;

“You’ve been asleep all night actually! Slept like the dead. And it went perfectly. I found a few other women that that terrible boss of yours has been making uncomfortable and we all filed a complaint with HR together. Strength in numbers. I wrote down their names and some details you should know on the back of pictures of them and put them on your bed. You’re all going out for drinks Friday night.”

&#x200B;

My doppleganger had made friends at work in one day where I had been alone for years. Of course, I had also put in no effort. But it's not like any of the women at work had invited me out to their lunches let alone out for drinks. 

&#x200B;

I nodded. 

&#x200B;

“I’m going to get coffee, I think it's going to take a minute for my brain to catch up.”

&#x200B;

I’d studied the pictures and the details before I left. Even knowing that I had new work friends didn’t prepare me for the strangeness in the office that day.

&#x200B;

First, there was coffee waiting at my desk with a sticky note containing a little heart and saying it was from Kara. Kara had not been in my list of pictures. 

&#x200B;

Then, my meeting had been canceled because I had explained the details so well during an impromptu conversation yesterday.

&#x200B;

People were friendly and greeted me by name. At lunch, a group of people I had never spoken to sat down at my table as I pulled my sandwich out and asked me about my day.

&#x200B;

I came home riding a high. My mirror listened to me gush about my day. 

&#x200B;

When Friday evening came, I had begun to feel nervous about my night out though.

&#x200B;

“I can’t do it!” I said, wringing my hands. 

&#x200B;

“Of course you can! These women are nice and you are going to have a blast.”

&#x200B;

“You go. You go instead of me.”

&#x200B;

The mirror in front of me frowned. 

&#x200B;

“Why would you not want to go have fun with your new friends?”

&#x200B;

“They like you, not me.”

&#x200B;

“They like you. And they don’t know there’s a me.”

&#x200B;

“Please.” The nerves in my gut had tangled themselves into a ball. 

&#x200B;

My image nodded back at me. I cut my finger with the knife I had placed in the bathroom closet after last time and as one we swiped the blood across the glass. The tingles lasted for seconds and then darkness and then I was laying on my bathroom floor again, a towel pillowed beneath my head. 

&#x200B;

My mouth tasted like vomit. I smelled like someone had dunked me in tequila.

&#x200B;

“There’s water and tylenol on the bathroom counter. I took some before I switched us back but it's been a while so you may want to take some again.”

&#x200B;

“Did we get hit by a truck last night? Why does everything ache?”

&#x200B;

“Because your body is 34 and it has a hangover of course! You can’t expect it to act the same as when you were in your 20s. The coffee should be just about ready for you though.”

&#x200B;

“I thought you said that it had been a while since we switched.”

&#x200B;

“It has. Did you know your coffee maker has a setting that lets you just tell it to make coffee every morning at a certain time? You should seriously use it. I thought you might need some so I prepped it last night.”

&#x200B;

“Thank you, that’s really thoughtful.”

&#x200B;

I took the medicine and sipped my water slowly then wandered into the kitchen to find my coffee ready and waiting. 

&#x200B;

“How was the night out?”

&#x200B;

“An absolute blast! These women are amazing! You’re so lucky to work in a place with such interesting people. Jen knows how to knit so well by the way, she’s making you a matching hat and scarf for the winter. Her work is absolutely adorable. You should really try getting to know them all. I think you’ll like them. And having some good friends will really make your life more complete. In my opinion at least.”

&#x200B;

I felt a little tug of jealousy deep in my heart. I pushed it down and nodded.

&#x200B;

“I’ll keep that in mind.”

&#x200B;

I made my way to my bedroom and went back to sleep. I really did feel like I had been hit by a freight train. This hangover was something else.

&#x200B;

I gave myself a pretty easy weekend. I had meant to go to the gym but I wasn’t feeling up to it. I stayed in bed for the most part and watched Netflix. It wasn’t until Monday that I woke up feeling more like myself. 

&#x200B;

After that, things in my life really started to improve. I took my mirror’s advice and started to make an effort to get to know my new friends. I went out with them at night, I’d been to their homes. Although, I hadn’t invited them to mine. I was a bit worried about needing to explain my bathroom mirror. 

&#x200B;

Having friends gave me new confidence at work as well. I found I was more confident in speaking up in meetings and presenting. 

&#x200B;

I spent less and less time doubting and criticizing myself. 

&#x200B;

It was a few months before I asked my mirror self to step in for me again. My best friend, Beth, was getting married. I was supposed to drive to my hometown, 5 hours away. While I hadn’t kept up with many people we’d grown up with, Beth had and I expected quite a few of them would be at the wedding. I had RSVP’d without a plus one and I just knew I’d be dodging comments all night long about why I didn’t have a date or when I was going to get married. The thought made me angry and anxious. I didn’t want to face all of these people who would act like there was something wrong with me. 

&#x200B;

My mirror frowned back at me when I made the request.

&#x200B;

“Are you quite sure? Maybe you’ve misjudged the people, or they’ve changed just like you have? I bet you would have fun if you tried to put yourself out there.”

&#x200B;

“I can’t take it! Please, you’re way better with people than I am. Don’t make me beg!”

&#x200B;

I added a little pout, playful but I hoped that it would do the trick. The thought of switching no longer made me fearful. The times before had improved my life significantly.

&#x200B;

“You know this time will be longer than before, right?”

&#x200B;

A little prickling sensation formed at the back of my neck but I ignored it.

&#x200B;

“I know, you’ll be in the driver’s seat all weekend long. Speaking of that, do you know how to drive?”

&#x200B;

“I do. I’ll do it if you’re sure.”

&#x200B;

“Completely.”

&#x200B;

So, we made the switch with a swipe of blood just like before.

&#x200B;

Normally, when I woke up it was on my side. But this was a longer switch so I wasn’t incredibly surprised to wake up and discover myself still in the mirror. 

&#x200B;

I was in a small bedroom. The mirror was hung on the wall and a projector screen was hung in front of it. My bathroom appeared on the screen itself as if it was reflecting there. The screen was in color but everything else in the room was in shades of gray. The color in my skin and clothes appeared when I stood in front of the mirror and leached out as soon as I moved away.

&#x200B;

A twin sized bed sat in one corner. A desk with a computer monitor that belonged in the early 2000’s sat in another. The floor had a thin, unpatterned carpet. There were no windows on the walls but a door stood closed at the far end of the room. I opened it and peaked my head outside and was greeted by whisps of blackness thick in the air. One of them grazed my arm and dark blood began to pour out. 

&#x200B;

I slammed the door quickly. Rapid bangs sounded at the wood. The whisps?

&#x200B;

I sat on the floor shaking. My entire body tingling with panic. 

&#x200B;

After a bit of time to calm myself, I found a bandage to wrap around my arm.

&#x200B;

A note on the desk caught my eye.

&#x200B;

*Dear Julia,*

&#x200B;

*I’ve watched you through our mirror for a while now. You were always so sad. So lonely. It’s why I first spoke to you.*

&#x200B;

*I’ve been wanting to tell you a bit about the world I’ve been living in but you never asked. I understand, I never asked before I found myself here either. You see, once I lived in your world. When I reached my 65th birthday, someone else tricked me through the mirror and left me here. I’m not sure just how long ago that was, but it feels like a very long time.* 

&#x200B;

*The only color in this world is the reflection in the mirror. Everything else is very empty. You’ll find that if you are in the mirror’s reflection space that you will appear as the person on the other side. At any other time, you will remain yourself.* 

&#x200B;

*The outside is very dangerous. I’m not certain what the creatures are, but they are vicious. Sometimes, you may hear voices. Perhaps others who are trapped in this world. Perhaps a trick. Do not try to go to them. You will both die by the time you reach each other, the creatures having devoured you. I saw it happen to the only other person I have ever seen here.* 

&#x200B;

*You will find that you do not feel hunger or thirst. There is a bed and you may sleep in it, but after a while here you will also cease to need that sleep.*

&#x200B;

*If you decide to switch places with someone, I hope that you will be discerning about that choice. You will be living as them from now on. To make the switch, simply cut your finger and swipe the blood across the mirror as they do the same on the other side. You will be able to reverse the switch from the other side with a new swipe of blood so long as the blood on this side has not yet dried. I believe time passes quite differently here as the blood lasts quite a while.*

&#x200B;

*I want you to understand why I chose you. At first, I simply reached out as you seemed to need someone to speak with. The first time, I really was only offering to help. The second time, though, you showed me that you were very passive in living your life. I told myself after that, that if you asked a third time that I would take your place permanently. If you’re reading this, then you have asked that third time.*

&#x200B;

*You see, you are not appreciating the gift of life that you have been given. You are sleepwalking through it. You fail to make the most of what you have at every opportunity. I hope that you are able to learn something from this experience. I hope that when the time comes that you steal someone else’s life, you are ready to live.*

&#x200B;

*Until then, I will be enjoying myself as you very, very much.*

&#x200B;

*Margaret*

&#x200B;

I’ve waited for Margret to come back to the mirror but so far she hasn’t returned. No one has. I’m not sure how much time has passed, really, but it seems endless. The computer here works and it has the internet. Or something that simulates it? I’m typing this up looking for help, I need to get out. I’m so alone here, please help me get out. 

&#x200B;

Sometimes, the things outside bang at the walls. I sit in the corner and try to make myself as small as possible. I can’t stop shaking when they push at the door and it bows to the force.

&#x200B;

Is there anyone willing to take my place? I would be so grateful for the second chance at life. I swear, I’ve learned my lesson. Please help me get out of this place.

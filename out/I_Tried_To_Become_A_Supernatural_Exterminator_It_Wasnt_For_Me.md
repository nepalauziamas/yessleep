Okay so I noticed that u/need_a_nightlight, a friend of mine, started posting about his job recently. Well not exactly friend, more of an acquaintance, but that's neither here nor there. What's important is that we know each other, and that we worked together in the past.

I wasn't an exterminator yet back then, and spoiler alert, I never became one. Not after our last case together.

Like he explained in his [first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/vb2ol6/i_am_an_exterminator_for_supernatural_pests_heres/), you have to jump through some hoops to get that job. The BoSS basically checks to see if you'll be their obedient guard dog, if they can trust you enough to throw you at danger until it goes away without you biting their hand. I made the  cut, but I had to shadow a qualified exterminator for six months before being qualified myself.

Need_a_nightlight was that exterminator. Not exactly a teacher or mentor, but I looked up to him. I also realize that using his reddit handle will become tiring very fast, but he seems to value his privacy so I won't use his name. For the purposes of this retelling, I guess I'll call him…Billy. Just cause I know it'll piss him off. And I'll call myself Bob.

So there we were, Billy and I. A few months into the gig of me playing the Robin to his Batman. We traveled the country far and wide, mostly after small fries for me to cut my metaphorical teeth into. Some ghouls, some poltergeists, a beginner voodoo witch at some point. Nothing major, things any hillbilly with a shotgun and some sage could take head on.

And our latest call didn't seem much different at first. An old mansion out in some woods ate a few curious teens, but one of them got out. He told the police wild stories of vines coming to life, tangling and strangling the others, so the officer passed the info up along the chain until it reached the BoSS.

"That doesn't sound like a job for us," I told Billy as we drove there. He finished giving me the short version of events, and I couldn't help but roll my eyes.

"Why not?" He asked.

"I don't know, I guess I expected something a little…different. Skinwalkers, wendigos, vampires…" he flinched when I mentioned that last part. "By the sounds of it, they're asking us to play glorified gardeners."

Billy chuckled, but it was dry. He kept his eyes fixed on the bumpy dirt roads, fastening his grip on the wheel. It took me a moment to notice his knuckles going white, but I realized I struck a chord.

"You'll have plenty of those, don't worry," he said flatly. "So here's a bit of advice: take the easy cases when you can. They pay less, but they're faster to complete and you'll make it out alive."

"Guess so," I mumbled.

The ride took a bit longer, and we spent it mostly in silence. Billy was a great mentor and partner, no doubt about it, but he wasn't the chatty type. After another half-hour or so however, we reached the place.

I spotted the spires over the treetops first. How big was this place to have god damned spires? They said mansion, not a castle.

"Over there," I said, pointing a finger in the general direction of the mansion.

An utterly pointless gesture, not like the road went any other way. I was just bored, and I liked getting on Billy's nerves with small stuff like that.

"I can see," he said plainly.

The forest ended, and the rest of the mansion came into view as we entered the clearing. One of the spires collapsed into the fenced in yard, the roof bent inwards in some places, and it was just overgrown with plantlife. Vines and greenery climbed every available surface. It looked like it was neat and classy at some point, but now it was little more than a ruin.

"Doesn't look like a fast job to me," I said.

Billy sighed.

"Yep, looks like we'll be at it all night long."

We parked at the gate and got out of the truck. Billy took the lead, going to the truck bed where he usually kept his weapons hidden under a tarp. When he lifted it up though, all I saw were gardening tools.

"Where are the guns?"

"Use your head, Bob," he said, jabbing a finger at the mansion. "Do you think you can shoot that shit away?"

"No," I answered with half a mouth.

"Thought so. Now get geared up and let's roll."

He tossed me a machete and one of those backpack sprayers for plants. For himself, he got another machete and a weed wacker with steel blades.

"Weed killer's over there," he said as he strapped the wacker around his shoulder. "Be careful with it, that stuff's strong."

I reached for the box he pointed out and pulled it closer. It had the logo of one of the shell companies the BoSS used in order to get stuff into our hands, so I didn't doubt Billy's claims. Knowing those crazy bastards, this thing could probably kill a man as fast as it killed any weeds.

"So what's the plan?"

"I go ahead and cut the vines, you come behind me and spray them to make sure they stay dead."

"Sounds good."

"We probably have to go inside and find the source, so I'll clear the entryway. Don't take long."

"Aye aye, captain."

Billy pulled the cord on the wacker a few times, and the motor came to life with a ton of noise. He gave the throttle a probing pull, spinning the blades through the air, and by his grin I figured he was satisfied. He'd show those plants what for.

I started mixing the weed killer with distilled water and pouring it into the tank while he went ahead. The front gate took a bit of convincing to open, Billy had to strike the rusty lock with the back of the machete until it broke. The lock, not the machete. 

Once in the yard, I heard him letting out a high pitched scream. He stomped his feet at the ground and spun the wacker around, sending bits of plants and pebbles flying every which way.

"Be careful, they move fast!" He yelled at me.

I gave him a thumbs up and continued my own work, so he continued his. As I waited, I looked over my shoulder at him every now and again, and found that he wasn't kidding. The vines remained motionless until he approached, then they shot out at him like ambushing snakes. The green strands coiled like the tails of a mighty beast, but Billy had a handle on things.

He stomped on them to keep them down, and turned them to shreds with the wacker. Take a moment and a breather, check the surroundings, then he advanced again. Now that he knew what he was dealing with, he took it slowly, meticulously making his way towards the front door.

I was done with the weed killer, so I got ready to join him. The straps of the pump came over my shoulders, the machete was strapped safely at my hip, and I had my hands on the lid of the container to throw it closed. But I never got to.

Something coiled around my legs, ensnaring my calves. I was pulled off my feet along with the box, and it fell on my head as the bottles of weed killer went everywhere.

"Fuck!"

The vines pulled me away from the truck, towards the yard as I tried to find something solid to grab onto. The only thing my hands reached was one of the bottles, so it got dragged along with me.

"Billy!" I yelled, trying to get his attention.

He didn't hear me over the noise of the wacker. I was pulled into the yard, my ass dragging through random grasses and thorny bullshit and leaving behind a long trail. The pump broke from the force, spilling the weed killer mix everywhere.

"Billy! Help!" I screamed again.

He turned, finally noticing me, and bolted. But he only made it a few steps before some vines caught his feet as well, pulling him off in a different direction. I was dragged towards one of the basement windows, he towards one of the walls.

The only difference was that Billy had more training and experience than me. He reached for his machete right away, reminding me I had one of those too. Then the vines slapped him against the wall and he fell unconscious.

"God damn it!"

He was pulled upstairs through one of the windows, and I was pulled into the basement. Had it been a modern house with a modern basement, the fall wouldn't have been much. Some six or seven feet at the very worst. But this place? Try fifteen feet.

The good thing was that I was pulled in legs first, so I didn't land on my head. The bad thing was that rolling to soften the blow entangled me more. And to top off the shit show, it was pitch dark. Outside we had the light of the moon and the headlights of Billy's truck, down there I had jack.

"Fucking…let…go…" I struggled, prying off one vine only for more to take its place.

They were covered in sharp barbs that cut through my clothes and thin gloves, and they dragged me further into the mansion. I reached for the machete again, pulling it free, but I had no room to swing it with my arms at my sides.

"Not…good…"

They constricted my body, forcing the air out of my lungs and cutting the blood flow to my head. I was growing dizzy, disoriented, and desperate. I'd pass out any moment, and if that happened, I was a goner. I had to do something, anything, and I had to do it fast.

Up ahead, the vines passed below some shelves loaded with bottles, and that gave me an idea. I struggled some more, got a grip with my heels on the floor, and turned my body around to face the obstacle. The vines smashed me into the first shelf, but I caught myself with my feet and pushed. It toppled away from me, crashing to the floor with a loud bang.

Bottles flew everywhere, breaking and covering the floor with acrid smelling liquids, but it worked. The shelf crushed the vines and they went limp for a moment, long enough for me to lift the machete and cut them. They squirmed, not unlike a worm you'd just ripped in half. If you ever did that as a kid you'll know what I mean, but maybe you weren't a psycho like me growing up.

At any rate, I dispatched the vines and took a moment to catch my breath. Sprawled on my back, it took me a bit to notice that I still held onto the bottle of weed killer I managed to grab. So tightly, in fact, that I bent the cheap plastic container.

It could've been useful though, so I stashed it into a pocket and got up. Cargo pants for the win, I have pockets for days, too bad none of them contained something a bit more helpful. Like a flamethrower, perhaps, so I could burn the whole damn place down.

'Wine?' I wondered as I got a whiff of the liquid soaking me to the bone. 'Whatever.'

I escaped for the moment, but I wasn't in the clear yet. I still had to get out of the basement, find Billy, and either finish the job or run away.

'Did he even make it?' I wondered.

Only one way to find out. We had short range radios with us, walkie talkies basically, for occasions like this one. Situations in the past had us split up, chasing after different entities, so we came prepared. I pulled mine out, thanking every deity under the sun that it wasn't smashed to pieces, and tried to hail Billy.

"Come in, Billy. Yo. Are you still alive?"

I tried a few more times, losing my hope little by little. He bumped his head pretty hard, so if he was out cold, the vines might've killed him already.

"I'm good, how about you?" He answered. My heart damn near did a flip in my chest at the sound of his voice.

"Fine, but not out of the woods yet. Where are you?"

"Up in the attic. You?"

"Down in the basement," I answered.

"Just…great. Fucking awesome," he lamented. "We have to meet up at the truck and rethink our plan. Can you get out?"

I looked at the basement window the vines pulled me through. Light from the truck's headlights cascaded in from outside, and my vision adapted somewhat to the darkness. But it was too high up for me to reach it, and I didn't have enough junk in the basement to pile below it.

"Not the way I came in, I'll have to pass through the mansion," I told Billy.

He let out a sigh punctured by static from the radios.

"Okay, get to the main hall. I'll try to reach you and we'll have to find an exit, the front door is teeming with vines."

"Roger that," I said.

"And stay in contact. If anything else happens, you call me and let me know."

"Will do."

I clipped the radio to my belt and searched my pockets for the flashlight. Didn't have it on me, I either forgot to pack it or it fell out. Knowing myself though, it was likely the former. Billy always told me I was too careless and clumsy for my own good, and I was starting to believe him.

So onward I marched through the dark, stopping now and again for my eyes to adjust to what little light trickled in from outside. Colors faded, trapping me in a black and white labyrinth, though it was mostly black to be honest. Point is I could barely see, but it was enough to move.

The door of the basement was on the opposite wall, with stone stairs spiraling up towards it, so I walked that way slowly. It laid open, hanging on the lower hinge as the upper one was broken. More vines spewed into the basement through it, clinging to the walls and stairs.

They stood still for the meantime, but I knew they'd come to life as soon as I approached. Could they detect movement somehow? Feel my footsteps through the ground? Or was it touch based, like flytraps?

'Let's find out.'

I picked up one of the bottles and rolled it on the ground towards the closest vine. It didn't react until the bottle made contact, then it went crazy. Swiping and swinging around until it caught the bottle by the neck, then it pulled back up the stairs at breakneck speeds, taking the bottle with it.

"Billy?" I said, tapping the radio.

"Yeah?"

"The vines are touch based, we might be able to sneak around them."

"Yeah, I know."

"Well gee, thank you for sharing."

We argued back and forth about it for a while as I made my way up the stairs. It was hard to find clear spots to step on, and I feared I'd have to start hacking away sooner or later.

"What even are these things?" I asked Billy after a while.

"Don't know, never seen or heard of anything similar."

"Possessed ivy?"

"Could be. Or maybe some exotic plant. We'll have to ask around when we get out."

The door led me to a corridor, extending to the left and right and bending out of sight in both directions. More doors lined the walls, some broken down and others closed. Any one of them could've held the exit, but then I thought better of it. 

Old places like this had different architectural styles. Main foyers, grand open spaces, double doors for important rooms. That's what I had to look for.

"How close are you?" I asked Billy, trying to decide which way to go. Outside, the exit had been to my right, so that's the way I picked.

"Corridor ceiling fell and blocked my way, I have to take detours through some rooms," Billy answered. "So a few minutes if everything goes right. How about you?"

"Same-ish," I said, carefully stepping over the vines lining the floor.

I got to the bend without alerting them, and I would've liked to keep it that way. The rooms I passed didn't contain anything of note, mainly old furniture rife with decay. Depending on the exact age of the mansion, they could've been either rooms for hired servants or slaves.

"These guys were filthy rich," Billy said out of the blue.

"How so?"

“I think their library is bigger than my house.”

"Shit man, we could be sitting on a small fortune in that case. Old books are valuable."

"If they're in good condition," Billy said, accompanied by sounds of turning pages. "These aren't even legible anymore."

"Bummer."

"We're not here to loot the place, focus on getting out."

The corridor led me to a foyer just like I'd expected, and it was indeed grand. Fireplace on the far wall, a wide flight of stairs leading to the first floor, portraits hanging all around. Well not really, most of them fell off the walls and were eaten by mold. 

The few that survived depicted a man and a woman dressed in Victorian era clothes. Stern expressions on their faces, and he had a mustache that looked perfect for twirling.

"Okay, I reached the main foyer," I told Billy.

"Wait for me there, I'll be right over."

I looked around some more, careful not to disturb the vines. A trophy hung above the fireplace, entangled in a mess of vines that rendered it nearly unrecognizable. But it looked like an animal head, tiger maybe. Or lion. Hard to tell.

I stepped on something soft, and looking down, I saw a dirty bear rug. The fur had been white once upon a time, but it wasn't anymore.

'Polar bear,' I realized. 'Looks like we have a little explorer on our hands.'

A little explorer that liked to show off by the looks of it, seeing as he displayed so many trophies right at the entrance. This man, whoever he'd been, had gone everywhere and did a bit of everything.

'Did he bring the vines back from some adventure?' I wondered. 'Another trophy? Was Billy right on the money with the exotic plant prediction?'

At any rate, the exit was there too. A sturdy door made out of massive wood and teeming with vines holding it shut. We couldn't use it.

"I'm here," Billy called out.

I spun around and saw him at the top of the stairs, tip-toeing his way down and towards me. Each one of his steps sent creaks through the old, rotten wood.

"Did you spot any exits?" He asked.

"No, but I saw open rooms down that way," I answered, jabbing a finger over my shoulder. "Maybe we can find a window to jump out of."

"Let's check."

He got half-way down the stairs without incidents, until one step in particular let out a creak louder than the rest. Billy paused, pulling his weight back slowly, giving me an oh shit expression.

"Careful," I almost whispered, stressed out of my mind as well.

He pulled back a bit more, until his foot left the dubious step. No sooner had he pulled back, and the whole lower half of the stairs collapsed in a heap. It wasn't quite a bang, but it was loud and it shook the entire mansion. Planks and debris rolled everywhere, awakening all of the vines and sending them into a mad frenzy.

The ones below my feet started moving, so I danced around as if on top of burning coals to dodge them. They raced past my feet, grabbing planks and pulling them away.

"Ah fuck, not again!" Billy screamed.

Looking back at him, I saw him on his back, his legs entangled. The vines pulled him off the stairs, and he crashed on top of the pile of junk. He probably got winded, but he still swung his machete left and right.

It did him little good in the grand scheme of things. Too many vines. Where he cut one down, ten more were ready to take its place.

They dragged him away, deeper into the mansion as he struggled to scream.

"Hold on, I'm coming!" I yelled.

At least the accident cleared out most of the vines, so I could move more freely. I sort of ran, sort of jumped around, dodging the occasional vine. Billy's screams got further and further away though, so I couldn't waste time. I pulled out the machete, and I started cutting down the vines in my way.

Take a left, take a right, get grabbed, break free. Pass through a room that looked like an old kitchen, and…

Billy's screams stopped.

"Fucking…"

This was getting me nowhere, I had to hurry up. Then I got an idea. A crazy, wild, exceedingly stupid idea, but an idea nonetheless. 

None of the vines had roots, they were more like feelers. Or the tentacles of a jellyfish, spread out to entangle prey and bring it back to the mouth. They all went back the same way, likely to a main body of sorts. I didn't need to run and risk getting lost, instead I could let them drag me right to the source.

'Please, God, let this work,' I thought, pulling out the bottle of weed killer and taking off the cap.

I dripped some on the blade of the machete, put the cap back on, and jumped on one of the vines. It crawled up my legs right away, and before I got to feel regret, I was down on my ass. The vine pulled me through the house, faster and faster, giving my posterior nasty rug burns.

More and more piled onto me on the way, but I kept my arms fanned out to retain use of them. Holding onto the machete in my left hand, and the bottle of weed killer in the right hand.

I was pulled out of the mansion through a collapsed wall, into a back garden of sorts. It was a huge open space reclaimed by nature, with old pathways peeking out from the greenery and a now dried out pond in the middle. On the back side of the property was an imposing greenhouse, little more than its skeleton remaining.

It used to be covered in glass by the looks of it, some shards still held on in the frames, but most of it was broken. Branches covered in strange leaves burst out from it, reaching to the sky. And it was where the vines pulled me to.

Once inside, the vines constricted around me harder and lifted me off the ground. I swung the machete at them, piercing some and cutting others until they released me. The weed killer acted fast, spreading through them like, well, a poison. Bad analogy, it is a poison. 

Anyway, the important part is that the vines I cut shriveled up and fell off. I fell some ten feet to the ground, twisting in the air so I wouldn't land on my head. Landed on my shoulder instead, and by the pain shooting down my neck and into the rest of my body, I figured I dislocated it.

"Fucking hell, it's just a plant. How can it be this much trouble?" I complained to no one in particular as I got back up to my feet.

Billy was there, up above me in the branches. Tangled up in what looked like a green cocoon, only the top of his head visible, but I recognized his hairdo. More of those cocoons hung off of different branches, some smaller and some bigger, some with antlers and other animal body parts peeking out.

"Billy!" I yelled up at him. "You still there, buddy?"

No answer, he was out cold. The vines likely strangled him, and if he wasn't dead yet I had to do something fast.

The tree had a main body and bulky roots spreading everywhere, so I figured it was a good place for an attack. I tip-toed closer, dodging more vines on the way, and collapsed against the trunk. The madness and pain were catching up to me.

"Okay, here we go," I mumbled, setting down the machete so I could pull out the bottle.

I undid the cap with my teeth, the left arm was busted beyond use, and I poured it at the base of the tree. Then I picked up the machete and stabbed away, creating wounds for the poison to seep in through.

The tree reacted right away with a shudder. It took me a moment to realize it wasn't the trunk though, it was the vines. All of them, the hundreds upon hundreds of vines, started shooting back from all over the property.

'It worked.'

I soaked the machete in the poison and went around stabbing more of the roots. Dodging the occasional vine shooting past like an oversized rubber band ready to take my head off. They were under a great deal of tension, breaking branches and leaving scratches in the trunk where they hit it.

The cocoons opened up one by one as the tree died, dropping bodies all around me. Deer, raccoons, other small critters. Even a god damned bear at some point. Humans too, so at least I found out what happened to those teens.

'Oh shit, Billy!' I remembered.

I rushed below his cocoon as it released him, and he fell on top of me. Movies make it look so easy and effortless to catch a falling human, but let me assure you, it's anything but. Catching him sent me down on my ass and broke one of my legs as well.

I yelled from the pain, from the frustration, from all of the tension that had built up within me. The other cases we had were doozies as well, don't get me wrong, but this one was just too much. As I waited for Billy to wake up, as the tree withered around us and leaves dropped to the ground in droves, I realized I wasn't made for this kind of life.

So I made up my mind. I'd wait for Billy to get up, I'd ask him to take me to a hospital, and I'd resign.

A few minutes later he came to his senses, sounding groggy and confused. I told him to get the hell off of me, explained to him what went down, and he dragged me out of the greenhouse.

"Fucking take me to a hospital already, you can finish up here later!" I yelled when he went back in by himself.

"Just let me check something, it'll only take a minute."

Spoiler alert, it took more than a minute. But he came back out holding what looked like a fruit, weird and spiky and black. He threw it on the ground and smashed it open with his machete to reveal a single round core.

"Seeds," he said. "We can't leave, we have to burn it down. All of it. If critters find these and carry them away, the whole region could be fucked."

True, without the vines to guard them animals could approach.

"I can't really help with that," I said, pointing to my shin that was bent at an awkward angle.

"I know, just wait here."

All of this waiting around got on my nerves, I was in quite a bit of pain, but I didn't complain. Billy went back to the truck and brought it around through the yard, then he procured a canister of gas from the truck bed.

"Always ready to burn shit down," I jabbed, forcing a chuckle.

"You know it," Billy said with a wide grin.

So that's what he did. He pulled the corpses of the teens out so we could return them, and he set the greenhouse ablaze. As we watched the flames climbing into the sky, lighting up the night and turning our problems to ash, I saw him pocketing one of the seeds.

"The BoSS might want to take a look at this," he said when he noticed me staring.

And that was that. We waited around for a few more minutes, making sure the blaze wouldn't spiral out of control, then we drove off. He dropped me at the nearest and went to deliver the bodies to the police. By the time he returned in the morning, I already had my shoulder and leg in casts.

"That's gonna take a while to heal, I'll have to take smaller cases until you can join me again."

"Yeah, about that," I said, trying to sound serious so he wouldn't think I was joking. "No offense, but fuck all of this with a ten foot pole. I quit."

Billy burst out laughing.

"I'll let the higher-ups know."

We chatted for a few more minutes, promised to meet up for a beer sometime, then he got going and left me to heal. And I can say with 100% certainty, I don't regret quitting a single bit. That lifestyle is a thrill for sure, but you'd have to be a special kind of crazy to last until retirement.

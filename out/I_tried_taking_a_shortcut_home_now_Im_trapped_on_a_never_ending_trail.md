I could feel my eyelids sinking with the wait of led weights as I attempted to stay conscious while the radio played a constant maddening static that would refuse to turn off during my route home from work. A ride that had been going for almost three hours, a supposed shortcut now feeling like a never ending corridor, its tree walls keeping me trapped. The constant dread of being trapped here growing periodically. No matter how long I drove, or how far I went, my gas tank never dropped, and my mileage never went up. A strong sense of claustrophobia began setting in the longer I traveled down this path, which grew even stronger as the moonlight began to fade, then flicker as if it was one giant light bulb, one that eventually went out and left me with the headlights of my car being the only source of light. 

I did my best to remain calm despite my surroundings. “It’s just a dream, that’s it, just a bad dream…” I began to whisper to myself in an attempt to rationalize everything but it all just felt too real to be any kind of dream. Things only got more worrying once the radio static was cut off, and replaced with a man speaking, sounding very unenthused, almost bored, not surprising considering he was doing a basic news broadcast…at first anyways. it was nice having something to listen to and try to take my mind off things, even if the man was saying extremely mundane and basic things, but then they got oddly specific…then personal. 

\*The date is May 25th 2022\*

\*it is 2:17am\*

\*the temperature is 23 degrees Celsius\*

\*the moon has gone out\*

\*Theodore has been driving down a never ending trail for 5.5 hours.\*

Once I heard that I had to stop the car for a moment in fear and confusion. How did they know where I was? How did they know who I am? who the hell was  watching me. I then processed the second half of that last message. He called it never ending, and the fact I’ve been driving over 5 hours longer than my typical ride home that only reinforces that claim.

I attempted to get out of the car, in thoughts maybe somehow taking the rest of the home on foot, but even if that theory turned out to be true, it wouldn’t have mattered…because every handle, on every door of my car had completely vanished, leaving nothing but a smooth plastic surface in their places. The windows wouldn’t roll down, and when I tried sending my fist through one out of desperation, the only thing to break were my knuckles, as if I just played  bloody knuckles with a brick wall. 

However during my panic the radio broadcaster gave me both hopelessness, yet at the same time a ray of hope, as he began listing off the activities of various other people around the world. 

\*Alex has chosen to spend the night in the great puppet emporium.\*

\*the Haymin brothers have found the red wax lake\*

\*Miles has just purchased a pack of parliament cigarettes\*

\*Ryan has entered his memories\*

\*Toby, and Teak are playing blackjack at Mr. Marlsnatch’s Crazy carnival.\*

\*Miles is sitting in at the bench of IronMill park\*

\*Evan has placed a large bid\*

\*The Carther siblings have met with a fortune teller\*

\*Ryan has made a hefty sale\*

\*Miles has learned the secrets of the world\*

\*Micheal has bought an old tv\*

\*Toby has begun beating the king of spades with wooden baseball bat\*

\*Teak has hit a blackjack\*

Hearing that things were still going on in the outside world sparked something in me. If things were still happening in the outside world, that must mean there’s still an outside world for me to get back to right? Sure I had no idea what half of them were actually doing  but they certainly aren't on an endless dirt path. Unfortunately for me that hope was crushed and that spark quickly put out once the broadcast continued.

\*Kirk had been lost to the trail\*

\*Keith had been lost to the trail\*

\*Sara has been lost to the trail\*

\*Seth has found his way to trail

\*Seth has been lost to the trail\*

\*Ellie has been lost to the trail\*

\*Janie has been lost to the trail\*

\*Carmine has been lost to the trail\*

Name after name of people who’ve been “lost” to the trail blared from the radio speakers. Each one like a jagged blade to the gut…Until one final name was said, like a small beacon of light shining through the dark empty path ahead of me.

\*Kenton has gotten off of the trail\*

After hearing that somebody made it alive, I began punching the gas like I was a bat out of hell. I didn’t think of anything other than making it to the end and returning to my home, something I’ve begun longing for deeply. I was able to drive for about a half hour without trouble, but then suddenly, and rather abruptly it felt like the temperature had dropped drastically. I could feel my fingertips begin to freeze up, to the point they were stuck to my steering wheel, my whole body felt like it had been submerged and held down in ice water as the radio spoke up to confirm the sudden weather change 

\*the temperature is -23 degrees celsius\*

\*the time is 6:43am\*

hearing his last line made my freeze even more. Had I really been driving over 10 hours? Was the radio fucking with me before when it told me someone made it out? Why was I brought here? All these questions rang through my head like fire alarms, until he spoke once more, causing only one question to invade my thoughts.

\*They have arrived onto the trail\* 

I could feel myself choking as the thought ran laps, planting seeds on who the hell “they” are. I began to completely freak out, yelling to myself questions and a slew of cuss words. “What is happening? Why am I here? what did I do to deserve this? fuck shit, shit, shit, sweet  fucking christ this cant be real ” I began babbling through shaky breathes before asking the question that really mattered. “And who the hell is they?”

\*You’ll see Theo\*

\*it’ll find you soon\*

For a moment, all thoughts of the unknown “they”, even the freezing cold blanket wrapped around me had completely fallen for a moment. He just answered me…he can fucking talk to me, and I have a strong feeling he has strong control of this place. I felt my rage boil over causing me to lash out at the radio. 

“OH YOU FUCKING COCK BITE, LET ME GO GODDAMN IT I HAVENT DONE ANYTHING TO YOU” I yelled out in a half plea half threat. 

\*You have done something to me\*

he responded in that flat unenthusiastic voice I’ve quickly come to hate. I paused for a moment trying to think of all the possible wrongs I could’ve done to warrant such a punishment, but none could come to mind so I asked. “So what the hell is it huh?” His response was the most twisted thing thing.

\*You’re entertaining me\*

\*I always enjoy a good comedy\*

His once manatone uncaring voice now having a slight hiss to it, and gave off the tone of a total smart ass. My rage was slowly replaced with confusion and fear the more I thought about how this psychopath found the acts of torture…funny. 

“what the hell is wrong with you?” I asked caucus

\*Toby has gone on lunch break\*

\*Eric's journal has landed in the mountains\*

\*Neil has just graduated\*

He said, his voice returning to its original bored, cold tone. “Wait no give me some answers damnit” I shouted, going to punch the radio, but my hand had been frozen to the steering wheel for so long trying to pull it away only caused the skin on my palm to tear off.

\*Theodore has lost some fingerprints\* 

I heard in his more twisted voice before quickly cutting back to a regular broadcast cast, and I mean cutting back, like the radio skipped a bit, it just didn’t sound natural.

\*Research notes have been found at sea\*

\*Neil is speaking with Mr. Horris\*

\*Carver has No-clipped\* 

\*They have arrived\*

Hearing the last one made my body run colder than should be physically possible, made even colder by the tone of his voice. It wasn’t flat and boring, or even a smart ass entertained one he’d get when messing with me. No it sounded malicious, sinister, and for a moment I swear I heard his voice drop ten octaves. He wasn’t toying with me anymore. That much was clear. Before I could ask, or plead, or speak a word, Two bright yellow headlights speeding towards the back of my car. It was far too dark to see the vehicle or its driver, but judging by the gap between the two lights I thought it could’ve been a motorcycle of some sort…until I realized there was no sound. It's not like these windows are soundproof, I heard the wind blowing as I drove, I should be able to hear a motorcycle engine at full speed right behind me. So I decided to switch on the taillights and saw what had been sent after me. 

It wasn’t a bike, or any kind of vehicle, but a giant gray skinned beast rapidly crawling at me, its unnaturally long limbs bent upwards like a spider. Once the creature locked it’s glowing yellow eyes on me, it’s mouthless face began to rip and tear away, the beast unhinging it’s newly revealed jaws, one’s filled with large jagged teeth seeming to form a permanent grin, before letting out a sharp ear piercing scream…causing my Car to completely break down. The radio returned once more however while I was desperately trying to start it back up.

\*Goodbye Theo, it’s been fun but unfortunately…\*

he said before a song title appeared on the display screen, two simple words. “Game over”. That too faded as I felt my car shake, and the sound of claws scratching at it. I turned back around to see the creature had crawled onto the back of my car, and with the blink of an eye, it was gone, until I heard a soft tap on my sunroof. I slowly looked up to see the creature staring down at me, it's unnatural jagged smile slightly widening with each tap, until eventually…the glass started to crack. 

Now I am here, writing this trapped in an icebox while the beast above me continues to slowly chip away at the glass. It’s getting too painful to continue typing and I’m quite sure I’m too frostbitten to go any further, but I needed to get this out no matter what. My phone is almost dead and I'm soon to follow it. I only hope I freeze to death before that thing gets through. This may sound ridiculous to many of you but please just listen when I say don’t travel down any dirt trails, especially not any leading to the woods, there’s a very good chance you'll end up stuck wandering it forever, until death, or something else comes for you.

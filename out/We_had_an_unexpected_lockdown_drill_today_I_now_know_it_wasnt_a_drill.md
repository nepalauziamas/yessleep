I go to a fairly regular middle school. It's a bit shitty-the paint is peeling in some spots, the asphalt is badly cracked, and the tables are covered in doodles and gum- but I don't consider it to be ghetto, as many others do. The school's about as good as it can get when you're in the middle of rural Colorado.

It was on this particular day, October tenth, that everything took a turn. We were usually informed before a lockdown drill, but we weren't this time. I was in my first period choir class when it happened, around 9:28. We all huddled together in one of the tight storage rooms, surrounded by instrument cases and disassembled drum sets.

The longest lockdown drill we had ever had was about 25 minutes long. It was around 9:48, 20 minutes into the lockdown, that we began to worry. But we thought that the officers were just stuck in traffic. Police officers had to come to the school, even if it was just a drill. We waited in there until the clock struck 10:00. This was when we began to silently panick. There was no way the traffic was that bad, especially considering that it was 10:00 o'clock on a Monday, and the nearest police station was only about three miles away.

At 10:21, nearly an hour into the lockdown, the police finally arrived. But we soon realized that it wasn't actually the police. The men wore black vests with a strange symbol. The symbol was three triangles. One red, one white, and one blue. They all touched corners, forming a larger triangle with an empty space in the middle. They didn't enter the school either, like the police usually did. One lifted a piece of plywood, while the other held a hammer and several nails. They were barricading the school.

As the clock hit 10:34, the hammering stopped. But the sound that began wasn't any better. An ungodly screech blared from down the hallway. It sounded nothing like any animal I had ever heard in my life. No deer, bear, mountain lion, or coyote I had ever faced produced a sound nearly as haunting. It sounded like something straight from the fiery pits of hell.

Several minutes later, the creature that had produced the sound began pounding on the door of the drama room, which was directly next door. It took only three hits to break down the door. As it began to massacre every living thing in that room, our teacher quickly led us out of ours. He wanted to get us as far away from the thing as possible.

We were able to find our way into the seventh grade hallway, with nothing more than our phone's flashlights to lead us. After no more than ten steps on the smooth floors of the hallway, we heard a wet noise, if that makes sense. Each step we took, we were stepping through a pool of unknown goop and liquid. Several flashlights pointed downward, and that's when I saw it. We had been walking through blood. The goop we had felt was partially chewed human flesh and organs. About five students audibly gagged, and two vomited right then and there.

We took just three more steps through the pile of blood and fresh vomit when a loud chewing sound came from behind us. I spun around instantly and pointed my flashlight down the darkened hall. That was when I finally saw the creature that had been terrorizing our school for an hour and a half. It was a quadriped beast that was larger than a lion. It had black fur, but the blood made the majority of it red. Its mouth opened wide in multiple directions, similar to the mouth of Predator. It was chewing on the severed leg of a student while lying in a puddle of human blood. It didn't take long for the beast to notice us, and it soon stood up and began to sprint towards us.

We instantly ran for our lives. Two students slipped in the blood and couldn't get back up in time, which gave the rest of us several minutes to get away. We were able to make it into the 7th grade social studies room, and we barricaded the door with tables and chairs.

We're currently trapped in this room. It's just past midnight, and my phone doesn't have much charge left. If this message reaches anybody on the outside, send help. Send help to Cleveland Middle School. We're running out of time.

The broadcast on the TV read “THEYRE BACK. ONE HOUR.” 

I looked to my twin sister Jaime. She was just as confused as i was. My parents shot up, already started gathering supplies. What the fuck? Did they know something i didn’t? I jokingly thought to myself, is this some kind of Boomer thing i don’t understand? 

I tried to talk to them. They were not interested in explaining, too busy grabbing food and water. I’ve never seen my mom run before, but damn was she fast. She ran all throughout the house grabbing whatever she could. My dad, a man who never showed his emotions before, was visibly scared. I asked “what was going on? Is everything okay?” He told “shut up, grab whatever i could from my room i could handle, and bring it to the basement.”

I grabbed what i could. My laptop, phone, chargers, blankets, pillows, and my purse. My parents already had their mattress half way down the stairs. Whatever we were preparing for, it would be for a long time. Our basement wasn’t very large, and kind of half assed furnished. It had an old couch from our previous house, a tv, and some bean bag chairs. Luckily, a bathroom too. My sister and i followed as my parents did, and grabbed my mattress as well. The basement wasn’t big enough for 3 mattresses, but i had a full one, and we could both sleep on it. 

What felt like 5 minutes, it had already been 55 minutes. My dad took a last look around the house, and walked back downstairs. Jaime, my mother, and i sat on the couch in anticipation. He put a large medal rod on the door, as to block things, i guess. He looked satisfied. He walked over, gave each of us a hug and told us that he loved us.  

The TV flashed, “DO NOT GO OUTSIDE. DO NOT INTERACT WITH ANYONE OUTSIDE. IF YOU HAVE NOT YET, SEEK SHELTER IMMEDIATELY.”

I begged my parents for an answer now. My mom sighed. 

“I really hoped this would never happen again, at least in our lifetime. I don’t know how long for, but it might be awhile. There are things that will be outside. They’re not... us. They look like us, they act like us, but they are NOT us.”

My dad chimes in. “These creatures.. they pretend to be us. They feed on us, trying to take our place. Thank god we are more prepared now. We are safe down here, and must wait for the broadcast to tell us they have left. Last time it lasted two weeks, hopefully it will be shorter this time.” 

I have never heard of this before, i haven’t even learned about it in school. Why are we just hearing about it now? 

My mom exclaimed, “we should get some sleep. It’s late, you both know everything now.” I laid in my bed with my sister next to me. Too exhausted to even play my nightly game of solitaire. 

I woke up from my 8am alarm, i was supposed to go to class today. Nevermind that i guess. 

i looked out at the very small window we had. It looked like a nice day out. I wanted to go outside so bad. My neighbors were out, passing around a football, children playing as well. I heard my family talking outside. I almost called out for them. I turned around and looked at my real family sleeping on the floor. I realized what was going on now, they’re here now. The creatures, attempting to be us. 

TV was still flashing with the same message. I looked outside once again, and got a closer look at my “family.” They did look like us, but something was off. They limbs slightly stretched longer than they should be, the faces slightly distorted, the skin almost a whiteish hue. You would think if they are trying to impersonate us, they could have done a better job. Then, i heard my doorbell go off. 

Someone is trying to get in, and it is not us.

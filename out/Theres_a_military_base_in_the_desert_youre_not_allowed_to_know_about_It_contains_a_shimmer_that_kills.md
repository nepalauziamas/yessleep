I dreamed a red dream then woke up to a klaxon screaming. Sirens were going off all over the base, dragging us out of bed. I had my boots on and rifle in hand within twenty seconds then I was out the door into the yard. It was the middle of the night but every light was on, even the big spotlights at the towers. Our little slice of the desert all around the base was shining brighter than any summer afternoon.

The sirens wailed again. I spotted my sergeant directing a group of soldiers towards the main gate. I jogged over to him, boots kicking up sand from the yard.

“Sir, what’s going on?” I asked.

Sgt. Evans was leaning over with his radio pressed to his year. It must have been hard to hear orders with that damn siren screeching. When Evans looked up at me, he was pale.

“Something’s gotten out of the Lab,” he said. “We’re under lockdown.”

I felt my blood drain until I probably looked as pale as the sarge. I’d never seen a breach of the Lab in the six years I’d been at Echo Base…but the old-timers told stories. Bad stories. Bloody stories. Tales of whole platoons that disappeared in the desert after something broke out of the modern catacombs below the base.

I tapped a finger above my rifle’s trigger guard.

“Is it…is it the thing they brought it last night?” I asked.

All of us surface-side guards had an unspoken agreement never to talk about what went into the big elevator in the middle of the base that led to the Lab. But if something got out, the old rules didn’t apply.

Evans shook his head. “I don’t know. There could have been anything in that truck and-”

A burst of gunfire rang out audible over the sirens. Then another burst and then rapid fire. The shots were coming from the northern warehouse. Sarge and I both shared a glance then ran for cover behind a parked Jeep. All around us, other soldiers were taking aim towards the warehouse. Some of the newer guards were shaking but even the vets looked a little shaky. We’d all seen the truck come in the night before. It was a blackout vehicle, armed and armored, and much bigger than our usual drop-offs. That meant that whatever was inside was considered hostile and dangerous.

And now it looked like it was out.

The gunfire stopped suddenly. I spent a long minute leaning around the Jeep, rifle pointed at the door to the warehouse. The only sound was the siren and then that stopped like a screamer suffocated by a plastic bag. I could hear my breathing and Evans’ next to me in the new silence. Lights began to flicker all around us. The spotlights went out first, then the perimeter lights, but the backup generator kicked in and the emergencies stayed on. That gave us just enough dim, coppery light to see the thing emerge from the warehouse.

It was human-sized and shaped but surrounded by a haze. The shimmer wrapped around the figure, a heat-blur that hid any feature or detail. Still, I could sense that the entity was aware of us.

Someone fired a burst.

There was a tracer round in the mix. I watched the orange wake left behind by the bullet. It should have connected with the thing in the doorway but there was no impact, no damage other than a few ripples in the haze. One of the guards in the tower nearest to me burst into flame and then the entire tower was on fire. More shots rang out but nothing appeared to affect the entity. More soldiers became living candles all around me. Those were the lucky ones. The creature in the shimmer moved, crossing the base in the time it took me to blink. One moment it was in front of the warehouse, the next it was near the east gate. It left a trail of flickering air behind it. All of the soldiers caught in that shine withered away. I saw them age–every second a decade–until they were bone and rags.

Neither Evans or I had fired at the creature yet. Sarge snapped his aim to follow the thing as it teleported around the base. For some reason, it didn’t seem able to leave. It was caught like a wasp in a mason jar but we were trapped with it. Evans lowered his rifle and signaled for me to do the same.

“Wait for our moment,” he said, loosening a grenade on his belt.

The figure in the shimmer kept warming around the yard, faster and faster, like it was frustrated. Then it stopped dead-on in front of us, maybe twenty feet away. Evans didn’t hesitate. He tossed the grenade and it landed right behind the monster. I heard a muffled *thump*.

“Oh God,” I whispered.

The grenade was exploding…slowly. I saw the metal come apart in a spray of fragments, a growing fireball crawling out so, *so* slow. The detonation was stuck in the air, hanging and expanding in a syrupy ripple. A moment later, it was snuffed out.

I felt the entity’s attention but knew it wasn’t on me directly.

Evans stood frozen.

“Hey, there’s a box in my room,” he told me. “Please-”

The shimmer was all around us and Evans was aging like the rest. He looked at me but never finished what he was trying to tell me before he was wasted away. The haze felt like water full of pins or a cold wind that went through me. Up close, the figure inside was clearly human but still only a shadow. It looked at me and I dropped my rifle. I could tell it was old and lost and it was getting unbelievably angry. But it didn’t hate us. It just refused to stay here.

I stumbled toward the east gate, tripping and falling in the sand as I went. There was fire all around me, and decay, but I kept my eyes focused on the gate controls. Two switches and a combination code later, the gate began to squeal open. The creature was close. I felt the wind again, the sharp atmosphere. It wasn’t leaving.

“Leave,” I said, not looking behind me. “Please leave.”

That did it. I felt a vicious wind pouring out through the open gate. We were like a plane being depressurized. I grabbed onto the gate controls and held tight. The maelstrom only lasted for a few seconds. The base was still and silent after it was gone. There were no wounded; anyone who was hurt was dead. I looked out the empty gate into the star-clogged night sky. The shimmer was moving away from the base slowly, leaving a trail of glass in the sand as it went.

The official report was–who would have guessed–gas leak. But even the “official” report didn’t make it far out of a blacksite base like ours. Maybe some senator on some security council glanced at it once, made a note for future budgets, and that was it. As far as I know, the thing that got out of the Lab is still walking around the Nevada desert.

If you see a ripple in the air that seems like a mirage or a heatwave, check closely for any hidden figures.

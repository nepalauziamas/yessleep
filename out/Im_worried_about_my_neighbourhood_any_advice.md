Hello there redditors :) I'm J and recently I moved house. My first home actually haha, I live in not the greatest area but its a home and that's what matters. Recently I set up one of those nest cameras to look about my house just to make sure everything's safe and thought it would come in handy but realistically is scared me more than helped.

It started a few weeks back when I first moved, see the bathroom window is facing the street and I often have it open to let out all the steam from the shower. But the other night there I am sat on the toilet at 1AM when I hear thundering footsteps running up the concrete. I first assumed that some drunkard had come home late but it wasn't until the footsteps got faster all the way up to the concrete outside of my window and the abruptly stopped. This stopping sound, the grinding of shoe on the concrete gave me an eerie sense of dread. Panic set in quite quickly as that running turned into slow steps towards my house. I really didn't have any clue what to do. I was too shocked to stand up off of the toilet so I sat there and heard it get closer. Then, nothing.

That was the first experience anyway, after managing to climb off the toilet and rushing back to my room I struggled to sleep that night. But as the days went on, time passed. I forgot, I did check the nest camera however, which proved pointless because there was little to nothing to see. 

Last week however, something happened. I was just confused at first really, then terrified. I'm back at my parents house now, but this night just keeps repeating in my head. The day went as usual, wake up, eat, work, eat, chill and then get to bed. As I walk into my bathroom on this night, at my second story bathroom window was a face, my bathroom windows have a funny pattern on the which makes it hard to see but I could clearly tell its eyes were unproportionate to its head, the eyes were gleaming back at me, the pupils were tiny compared to the whites. As I stood there it must have noticed me, its smile grew, revealing these perfect white teeth and eventually the smile ran up the cheek bone almost to the ears. Terror, pure horror was what I felt. Like a movie. I closed the bathroom door. instantly booked myself an uber and got out asap. The nest camera caught it all, and when I looked, it had a long, naked, skinny, frail, decrepit body. It looked like a grandmas face the way its skin melted. Its legs rose above the first floor windows where its body then met its head. Its arms dragged along the floor. Almost as if it knew, its head moved robotically towards the camera, keeping its odd smile and then walked off down the street.

My parents refuse to look at the camera footage and to be honest. I dont even want to look at it anymore, can someone help? Im happy to send you the nest footage if need be, just anyone please.

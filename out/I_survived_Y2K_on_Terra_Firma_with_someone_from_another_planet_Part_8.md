Back in the original lab they walked up to Jane who was petting Nara now and she had a plate of chicken nuggets on the computer desk and asked Peter if it was okay for her to eat them. She explained they had a cafeteria when he raised his eyebrows. He laughed, nodded, and thanked her. He brought dog food but these were unusual circumstances and Nara was licking her chops. She deserved to be spoiled for the evening. 

Peter sat down and read a bunch of messages from Troy asking what the hell was going on. He started filling him in while Lynn interrogated Mark about what came back in the machine from Earth. 

Mark said, "Well, we put trackers on everything we sent including inanimate objects, and it showed they went to Earth, but some went to different areas even though we put in the address the same each time to what seemed like a remote forest. Nothing ever came back and eventually each of the trackers appeared to fail. We eventually just gave up hope but kept sending mice and even a chicken once... the chickens' tracker didn't seem to move very much aside from a few times until it failed right outside the box." 

"So the chicken came back?!" Lynn asked. 

"No, just a bunch of twigs and some leaves; after studying the genetic makeup it looks similar to our common forest plants, but slightly different." 

"Hmmm", Lynn said, lost in thought. 

Just then the door slid open and Mark said, "Ahh, but speaking of..." as a woman with an unusual gait came over to them. 

"Everyone, this is Tabitha. She is from planet Earth, she followed the dirt and leaves a day later, she had dragged into the transporter when she was inspecting it and taking our experiments to her own lab. Turns out she's a scientist on her planet and noticed what we were doing, even though she didn't know exactly what it was." 

Lynn and Peters' mouths dropped open as she gave a small wave. 

"She's been kind enough to give us sample swabs of her DNA and assist us so far, as she'd like to go home as soon as we hopefully get through this." 

Lynn snapped out of her shock with a, "HOW the hell did you survive?!" 

Tabitha replied, "I have no idea. They had a doctor check me out and I seem fine aside from these old leg injuries from when I was a kid that are acting up. On Earth they seemed like they healed years ago aside from some soreness when I was on my feet too much. It seems maybe being transported affected them somehow."Â  

Peter shoved out a chair next to him that she gratefully took while he stared in disbelief. He saw movement on the computer and told Troy about how the transporter sent a human from Earth. 

"No fucking way", he replied. 

" Yes fucking way!" 

"Well can I come? I want to help!" 

"I thought you didn't believe me! Plus she has injuries from when she was a kid that are being triggered. Who knows what the machine did to her!" He snuck a glance at her to make sure she wasn't reading, but she was being interrogated by Lynn. 

"Do you have any from when you were a kid?" Meeting his online friend from another planet did sound enticing if he wanted to do it. "But what if something bad happens here and you can't get back to Earth?", he asked. 

"No, dude, I've never even broken a bone! I just lost my job, my family hates me, and Earth sucksssss. What's the worst that could happen?! I believe you after everything you've been sending, even though I hate being wrong. >:[" 

Peter scoffed and Mark, Lynn, and Jane turned to him. 

"So, uh... Troy wants to come here to try to help." 

Lynn said absolutely not at the same time that Mark said it could help with their research. It was one thing for rats or a chicken, but for humans they needed consent, and when officials didn't even believe them, they didn't exactly have a line out the door of volunteers to go there, he said. Let alone have someone from Earth come here aside from the accidental situation with Tabitha. He said that Troy would need to send his latitude and longitude coordinates of a place where too many people wouldn't see him, and they'd have to do it as soon as possible, they needed to prepare more and Mark and Jane needed to oversee it; they needed to get back to work to try to figure out what was going to happen tonight. It appeared that they were all going to pull all-nighters or sleep in shifts. 

Lynn said it was a bad idea, but Mark shrugged and said that these were odd circumstances and they could use any hands to help they could get, along with the consensual research he explained before. She threw her hands up in her own annoyed consent at Peter. Tabitha was watching all of this quizzically.
"Welcome to Terra Firma", he laughed nervously towards her. She laughed back and thanked him. 

He told Troy what he needed from him and told him to pack a small bag with any necessities, but they had food and most basics here at the lab. 

He asked Mark when they were going to do this and he told him to ask Troy to head to the destination in approximately one hour.
Troy agreed; Peter could not believe this was happening. He just hoped nothing would go wrong, and then they could actually find out what was going to happen later and what they should do. 

He noticed that the team of researchers had been huddled by one particular computer and kept calling Mark over while he was talking to Troy and Jane was telling them what to expect with Troy coming; maybe they had found some concrete information! 

While Jane led them back to the room with the transporter, Peter asked Tabitha why she didn't go back to Earth right away. She said, "I'm a scientist myself. This is the most groundbreaking thing I've ever heard of, and the risks of tonight are well worth it. I'd never forgive myself if I wasn't here to witness it and try to help if I can." 

She seemed about his age, maybe late twenties to mid-thirties. The lack of sleep and all of the excitement must be getting to him, she made him a little nervous in a butterflies type way. 

They went through that windy hallway again and Jane said they were just waiting on Mark to catch up in a minute, then they would send the transporter. They all huddled around it, looking at it in a mixture of awe and disbelief after Jane started it up and it started making a low but steady whirring sound. How could this be real?

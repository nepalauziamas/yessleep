Music was better in the old days, these days you have rappers with colored hair talking nonsense and Woman who have no respect for themselves, However in the past singers had true class.

I remember being taken with several other troops to a Judy Garland concert in 1939 just before we were shipped off to war. The Nazis had invaded Poland and we were being sent to fight them, however just before we left we were treated to a talented young Woman singing her heart out for us. I also remember thinking that when I came back from the war I would be a musician. Sadly it never happened.

That same night we said goodbye to our loved ones, made our way to the airfield and helped load boxes into planes before setting off on our journey. Many of us would never make it back.

A few weeks into the battle we were low on supplies and many of our leaders were dead. Communication was cut off and we were scared. As enemy soldiers made their way towards us, we tried our best to gather as much supplies as possible to fight them off.

We finally opened the boxes that we had loaded onto the plane weeks ago, having no leaders we didn’t know what to do with them and tried to wait for instructions. However now it was too late for instructions. Imagine our surprise when we found record players in the boxes. 

Each record player was accompanied by speakers and a record. We were confused but we knew we were about to die, so in a moment of solace we placed the record on the player and started the music.

As far as we know, we were attacked after that. Unfortunately I can’t remember any of it but according to the commander who addressed us when we awoke in the hospital. A bomb was set off close to us that heavily injured most of us and blew out our eardrums. Luckily reinforcements arrived in time and were able to save us.

I was heartbroken but I was happy to be alive. While the army honored me, because I was medically deaf I was never able to become a musician. A few weeks after I was released I returned to the military base to collect my belongings from a storage room. While there I saw one of the records that we had with us the night we were attacked and snuck it out of the base. Keeping it as a souvenir.

I’ve lived a long and quiet life since than, longer than most. I kept myself healthy and happy and now I’m well over a hundred. A few weeks ago I was looking through my old belongings in the attic when I came across that record again. 

My children, grandchildren and great grandchildren were holding a party for me and I wanted to show them the things I collected throughout my life. I figured I would top it all off by showing them how music was better in the old days.

After an amazing day celebrating and showcasing the past I put the record, titled Operation Paperclip, in the player and hit play. I don’t understand what happened next.

My family members grew rabid and started attacking each other, one by one they ripped into the bodies of each other. Until no one was left breathing and the grass of the park was covered in blood. I don’t know why they did this, but it was too much for my heart. I was terrified and past out.

I awoke in a hospital a few days later with no explanation to what happened and every member of my family dead. I guess because of my old age, I’ll soon be with them.

Mine and my sisters' parents weren't around much. I was 17 at the time, and my sister was 13. She saw me more as a mother than her big sister. One day, she came out about something to me. She told me she was starting to get feelings for her friend that is a girl. I was the first person she told because our parents were out partying and she didn't feel like she would be accepted by them. I comforted her and told her that if they don't accept her, then I would talk with them. A few days later, my sister came rushing into my room crying. "They told me I was a mistake and to get out!"

I marched into their room. I told them if they didn't accept her, then I was leaving. That was exactly what I ended up doing. The next day, I packed my bags and so did my little sister, Emma. We were invited to stay at my friend's place for a little. Their family was nice, but soon after, they kicked us out. My friend had a large family, and they just couldn't afford to feed two more mouths. We ended up living on the streets. Every day, we would sit out front of a store begging for money and food. It was not the life we kids should have. 

In front of us, a bag of five dollars lay on the ground. Not many people would provide for us, but we got enough for just under one meal's worth. A stranger walking by us tossed something into the bag. I smiled at them. When the person walked off, I leaned over the bag and looked in. They left us ten dollars and a key. On the key was an address. I got up and ran over to the person, but they just ran away. I was convinced they knew what they left.

I made my way back over to Emma. "Come on, a stranger left us a key." She looked hesitant but followed. The house looked to be old and had been abandoned. But I wasn't bothered because it beats having no home. I thought. I stuck the key into the front door, but it didn't unlock. 

"Mabey we can try the back door." We crept through the uncut grass to the back door. It unlocked. The door creaked open, and I stepped inside. I heard Emma sneeze. 

"It's so dusty in here!" She told me. I looked around and dragged my finger across the coffee table. 

"It sure is." I set down my bag on the couch. The house was a decent size, but no working lights. It looked like an old person lived there before it became abandoned. I decided to look around. The bookshelf held some dusty books. 

As I was dusting off books, I came across a brown leather book that said "diary" on the front. I opened it.

"Dear diary, today I did some baking with my grandmother. We baked a few cookies. When we took them out of the oven, I ate one of them and decided to leave the rest 'til later. When I came back to them an hour later, they were all gone. I confronted grandma, but she completely denied it. She's silly like that," I read aloud. Emma came over. I read the next entry.

"Dear diary, earlier today grandma had an accident. She's in the hospital, so I'll be home alone for a few days. I hope she gets better. I don't want to go into foster care. Now, I don't know where the key to the back door went. We don't use that door anyways. I'll update when I have the chance." I looked down at the key in my hand. I continued to read.

"Dear diary, the doctors said that my grandmother might not make it. I'm scared because every time I cook something, someone else finishes it. I've been hearing voices. I don't know what's going on, but I need to find out." I got an eerie feeling coming from the house.

"Dear diary, the basement. The voices were coming from the basement. I started hearing them again and followed the sound. I didn't want to go into the basement, but ill go when I feel courageous." I looked over at Emma, who looked frightened.

"I'm sure it's just a story," I said. "Dear diary, it's not a person. I'm leaving this house because I don't feel safe anymore. I'm going to live with a friend. I'm sure they won't mind." I couldn't convince myself that it was only a story.

"Dear diary, they found me! I need to go back home! What do I do?! I'll update when I can!" I put the diary down for a second. Emma started crying.

"Dear diary, if you are someone reading my diary, leave! If you start hearing the voices, they won't stop until you are in the basement with the rest of the bodies."

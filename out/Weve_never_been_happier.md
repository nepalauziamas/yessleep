 My wife and I have been married for 10 years. We met in college and got married right after graduation. Once we established our careers in our respected fields, we decided to start a family. Unfortunately, after three years of trying and trying, we had not been able to produce a child. It was time to see a doctor.

 After some tests, It was determined that my wife was unable to have children. The doctor suggested a few options, including adoption. The thought of another woman carrying our baby in her womb or adopting a stranger's child, did not appeal to my wife. We decided in the end that we loved each other and were just going to focus on our marriage. At least that was the plan.

 Years went by, we focused on the materialistic aspects of life, vacations and such luxuries. I will admit it, seeing our peers starting families and hearing them talk about childhood milestones was annoying to me. I guess you can say i was internally bitter and jealous. I had all but given up on the idea of having a baby. Then I met the woman of my dreams or should I say in my dreams.

 The first time I met her in my dreams was a year and half ago. It is was nothing erotic or sexual, I felt peace and comfortable. I couldn't describe her at first due the fact that she was a shadow essentially. Yet, I felt her embrace me and I was peace. The only downside was even thought I was sleeping eight hours, I woke up exhausted.

 I was looking forward to bedtime each day, not because my wife and I were going to be intimate, that had stopped after year seven of our marriage. I am not saying we were unhappy but my wife had lost interest since we could produce no offspring. Each night I was finding the comfort and the affection I was lacking in the woman from my dreams. 

 It quickly became sexual as the shadow's features revealed themselves to me. I was hypnotized by her beauty, don't get me wrong, I love my wife. The woman in my dreams was similar to her but her eyes were full of the desire that had long ago faded in my marriage. The dreams became more intense and I even started napping at work, just so I could see her again.

 I was super exhausted, even though I was sleeping and napping all the time. My wife on the other hand seemed to be looking refreshed and prettier. She was dressing in more revealing clothes, it was as if she was evolving into the woman from my dreams. I was enjoying this new version of my wife. Maybe I was starting to imagine stuff from my fantasy dreams, regardless I felt guilty. 

 I had the final dream a month ago. As usual, I was eager to fall asleep and didn't even wait til bedtime. The dream started strange, I was with the woman, she was pregnant and I mean pregnant. Eight or nine months by my estimate, I was confused because most times it was straight to sex but this was different, this felt real. I could tell she was uncomfortable, I wanted to have my usual dream but felt uneasy. I wanted to wake up, this wasn't fun anymore.

 The scene changed to a hospital delivery room, the woman in my dream was in labor. I sat by her side as the doctor and the nursing staff were moving around her. She was told to start pushing and as she did, she let out a demonic sound. I had never heard her ever make this noise, not even when we did the deed before. I was scared for the first time, I looked upon her face and saw the most disgusting demonic face. I looked down to see what she was giving birth to and it was a sleeping version of my wife. 

I woke up in a cold sweat. I was in my own bed next to my wife, I reached over to hold my wife for comfort. She was concerned and I reassured her that it was all a bad dream. I could feel her warmth and something else I hadn't felt in a while. She moved into me and for the first time in a long time we made love.  I drifted off to sleep and for the first time in months, I had dreamless sleep.

 We made a doctors appointment for my wife a few weeks later. She had not been feeling well, she was feeling nauseous and dizzy at times. After the doctor ran some tests, including a pregnancy test, that I thought was unnecessary since my wife couldn't get pregnant, the doctor came into the room smiling.  He congratulated us. My wife was pregnant according to the test results. He gave us information and again congratulated us.

I was on cloud nine, my wife and I were to become parents against all odds. I was try so hard not to cry from happiness. As we made our way to receptionist area to make the next appointment, I stopped at the large mirror hanging on  the wall. I  adjusted my glasses and in the reflection behind me was my now pregnant wife talking to the receptionist. She turned to ask me about the appointment, in the mirror's reflection was the woman from the dream. Her face was demonic, she smiled at me and said " We've never been happier."

This happened over the span of 4 years time stamps will be there in order from first in counter to most recent 

 9years old First ever time seeing it. Me and my cousin Alex were having a sleep over at my house and it started out like normal. He arrived and we went and rode the dirt bike in the woods since we lived in the county and nobody minded. Went and started mudding until it started to get slightly dark then we headed back. We put the dirt bike up and ate then we decided to sleep out side and all that jazz you know child hood fun. At a bought 1-2 AM we saw something in the woods start to cross the yard slowly and we thought it was a dog. We were wronger than ever before then I said be quiet and Alex said ok. We had said this so quiet I don’t know how it heard us but it slowly looked at us moon shining on it’s pale skin I had lent both iced this before. The moon had shown right on it. We ran cold the thing slowly stood on it’s disproportionate body it stood up and it was  taller than anything I’d ever seen and it had long arms almost reaching its knees. It’s skin was tight on it’s body and it had something in its hand I looked closer and I saw a chain I was cramping my pants at this point (not literally I was just scared) then it started off running in to the woods but the chain was pulling something. It was large ish. We ran in side and we’re terrified the next day we found out the next door nabours dog was missing. 

Almost one year later 10 years old  means Alex had went camping with his step dad and we’re pretty excited his dad was an ex service member so we weren’t scared  his whole family went . 2 sisters older and mom .  We played guns in the woods all day and then set up a tent and went to the camp fire. We ate and then we heard it a loud crack smash !! We all shot up and Paul the step dad went to check it out he came back 3 sec later and grabbed his gun .  Went in to the woods and was walking around while this thing ran around and screeched then he came back and said let’s. Get some rest now and we all went to our tents and went to sleep . 2-3 AM me and Alex woke up to a bunch of scratching on our tent and we were silent we grabbed our knives and heard it shifting around this continues to happen for a little while. When we got up in the morning we saw a disturbance in the pine straw and it was like it was a trail then it went off into the woods and then we lost it. 

13 years old I was at my dads and it was night time I let the dog out and was standing outside he lives in bofu (middle of no where) I watched it trout around and so it’s thing boom the dog stops dead in it’s tracks. Now I’ve never heard this dog bark before ever. It loses its mind barking and freaking out then I saw it move from a burn pile that was put out it moved toward us Lankey and tall I said oh shit  and opened the door and we ream inside locked the door and I went to the bathroom to hide for a few minutes. 

Three months later at the same place I saw the first one at this time I was 6 houses down at my grandmaws. Me and Alex were fishing and vaping at the creek that her yard backed up to it was 3AM and we saw it across the creek it was barle visible across the creek but thare it was looking at us think we were cool vaping. Then the moon came through a cloud and we saw what was hiding in the woods the skin was pale and tight it’s eyes were like black holes and nose was gone in place were two holes tho mouth was grinning ear to ear quit literly then it moved and it was in the shadows again then we looked at each other and I took a picture on Snapchat ( really dark but flashed enough to see it a little ) boom it started running and this woods was thick and a hurricane came through 3 years ago so it was really messsed up but it made toot to the log in a matted of seconds and we ran it came after us all while shrieking we made it to the house in a nic of time to we closed the door on it and it smacked against it we locked it and went in the room to recoop. The next day we checked on the spot to get our stuff and went to check out the part where the thing chased us at the woods was so thick I couldent even make it through we turned around and went home shook.

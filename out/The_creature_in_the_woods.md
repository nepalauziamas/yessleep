This story takes place when I was 11 in a camp sight in the middle of the woods near a beach

   When I was 11 my cousin Alex and his family had invited me to camping with them.  Me being and outdoorsy 11 year old I was obliged and packed up asap. 

   We reached the camp sight and it was a very small patch of clear brush that nobody was on and we were excited. We setup our tents and started playing Vietnam war ( a fun game we made up). We were playing in the woods and got called to eat lunch so we ran but I dropped my to gun ( this is important later) we ate and then we started playing with the pellet rifles and shooting skets and bugs. 

   After this I looked in the woods and saw something large and skinny dart into the log in the woods. This caught me off guard but I kept playing thinking it was Paul ( Alexs step dad) so we kept shooting bugs and soon it was dinner. We put the guns away and ate.

  Whilst sitting at the camp fire at prolly like 11-12 pm we heard a large (crack boom) in the woods. Then mr Paul stood up and said

Stay here and don’t move a muscle 

Being the adventurous little kids we we’re didint listen and went to the woods 

Mr Paul yelled at us as he grabbed his gun and said stay by the fire!

We ran to the fire and watched 

 Mr Paul was a ex marine and was big like 6.3 and buff kinda big he went into the woods and we heard shouting and yelling then a horrifying screech echoed out. He came back a few minutes later and we went to bed. 

 Me and Alex went to lay down in our tent and mr Paul and his mom and sister went to the other tent 

  I woke up at 3 Am to scratching and movement outside the tent I woke Alex and he said shh we got the knives out and looking back idk why that’s not gonna do anything. 

 It circled our tent for an hour or that’s what it felt like whilst touching it and poking it i thing it was trying to find us. But then it stoped and we heard loud heavy foot steps going toward the woods. 
 
 It left and we breathed a sigh of relief 

 We went back to sleep and got up the the next day. We looked out side the tent and there was a trail in the pine straw around the tent. So we went to look where it went and it disappeared soon after. We started to pack up and I had to go get the toy gun. 

I went into to woods to find the toy gun and I saw it hunched over by the gun it’s skin was pale and way to tight on it. It’s arms were lanky and disproportionate to its body and had something on its head like horns. It saw me. 

It screeched and ran toward me .I screamed and ran to the camp sigh and we packed up and left imedently after. 

I don’t know what I saw but that day. But that screech still lingers in my head like I can still hear it. Like I wants me to go back.

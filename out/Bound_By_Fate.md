My name is Cyrus Roddin, and I have a very simple question, what do you think of when you hear the word “Fate”? I assume you think of a predetermined destiny or simply the future. What if I told you I have met Fate, yes Fate is a being that lives inside of me. You see, ever since I was little I had this guy talking to me in my head. A deep voice always plagued my thoughts and got in the way, and he’s even speaking now telling me that his voice isn’t “that deep”. 

I assume as you read this you’re thinking to yourself “Oh boy another random fella that hears voices, what else is new?”, and that’s a completely valid statement. I am not insulted when people tell me it isn’t real, because I know the truth. Fate is always telling me what to say and do, and it has plagued me for quite a while now. I don’t want to go today in depth about Fate’s crimes but- 

Looks like I gotta start another damn paragraph because Cyrus is getting all emotional and afraid to say anything about what WE did, the whiney bitch is just as responsible. You see, we first met when little Cy was about 5 years old. I made sure that he obeyed me, and we had so much fun. We would throw rocks at birds, crush bugs, and watch fire burn as hot as Hell itself. Something about watching the black smoke rise into the sky, it really does make you feel good…makes you feel like the world is yours. The first real crime we got into some complications with was at the local candy store. This fat neighborhood prick pushed us to the ground…and little Cy started crying like total and complete embarrassment. So I got his ass up, took the reigns, and beat the shit out of the kid. He swelled up real nice, and damn was it a sight to see. Nothing happened for a while, until we turned 23 that’s when-

To anyone reading this…I am so sorry for what was just said. I am not one for expletives and I am certainly not a violent person…that incident was all Fate’s fault, I was powerless. I can still remember talking to his parents…how appalled I was at my actions. I told my parents Fate made me do it, but they thought it was some “imaginary friend” phase. I assure you, Fate isn’t imaginary and he sure as hell isn’t my friend. Of course, as soon as I wrote that out, Fate is protesting but I digress. As I sat in my cell a week ago, it gave me time to reflect and try to find a way to get rid-

Yeah yeah, get rid of me, you can try you miserable bastard. What he didn’t tell anyone is that a week ago, we broke out of that piss smelling cell…thanks to yours truly. So now I am positive that you’re wondering what put us in there to begin with? So, going back to when I was rudely interrupted, back to when we had just turned 23. I’m a drinker, but Cy’s lightweight  body can’t handle sipping on too much hooch. Anyways, we had a little too much of the old liquid courage and we headed down into this little neighborhood nearby. We saw one of the finest looking homes in area, the kinda home where the owners piss gold and shit diamonds. We had to take a look, so we climbed the pillar, and peaked in the window. Our hood was on, and we were definitely the kinda guy you worry about at night. The guy you’re afraid watches you through the window, the guy you’re afraid you’ll see when you open the curtain…and I loved every second of it. We broke in through the window, waking the house up. That’s when we drew a nice little friend called a chef’s knife, ready to dice up any motherfu-

That’s not who I am. I am not a murderer, I am not a violent person. What happened that day is all Fate’s fault. I didn’t want to be there, I didn’t want to break in…I didn’t want to end the lives of anybody…so much blood, so many screams. We left with so many valuables…diamond necklaces coated in the fluid of the woman who once wore them. Wedding rings…symbols of a couple’s happiness together. We took their phones…and most of all we took their happiness. Fate took all of that away, from innocent-

I didn’t take anything alone, WE took their jewelry, WE took their lives, WE broke into their home. Do not begin to blame me for-

I can’t manage this. Even though I escaped, I know Fate will do what he did again. I can’t allow that to happen…I won’t let it happen. This will be the end. It’s time for you Fate…to meet your fate.

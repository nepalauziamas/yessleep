6 years ago, I was sitting in my new house. I finally got my own place and had some alone time for once. Most people would spend that time throwing parties or bringing girls over but I spent it by just listening to soul music or binge watching horror shows until I hear the birds come up. I know it sounds like I am a jobless loser but I actually have a very nice job, I work at this news company as an IT. The company is very old so most of my time there is just getting old computers to barely start up again. 

Today was the same thing, fixing computers, giving advice to the employees that they will probably ignore and coming back home to look for new bad horror movies. But something was different. When I was leaving the building I could hear something close to me, a bit like screaming, but you could easily tell that it's not human. I laughed it off as a hallucination due to lack of sleep and watching too much horror and went back home normally. But I couldn't just shake it off, there was definitely something wrong. Something was near me and it wasn't nice. 

I tried to shake off the feeling by watching a comedy this time, but it wouldn't go away. I tried to calm myself with some hot tea but my hand was shaking so much that I was just making a mess all over the counter. I sat down again and played some calm jazz next to the comedy. Yelps were coming through the window. I told myself to not look out of the window it could be a crackhead that would freak out if I saw him but curiosity took over me and I opened it. 

It wasn't of this world. It's face was so skinny that you could see the outline of the skull, it's back was fully exposed with its spine hanging out in the open, it kept yelping with every step it took and sometimes it stops moving to break down into louder screams and hysterics. I couldn't believe what I was seeing, but I couldn't pry my eyes away. It was just moving through my backyard with no trace as to where it came from. I eventually peeled myself off the window and went spread salt all over the house and locked myself in my room to protect myself. 

It's screams were unbelievably loud, they were so loud that I had tinnitus for 2 years after this incident. What was even stranger is that there is nobody minding this thing or coming to check what's the cause or the screaming. Is this a normal thing in this neighbourhood? Were they all too scared? Or am I the only one who sees it? The only thing I knew for sure is that it was real. It was leaving footprints behind that when I checked later were still there, the tinnitus I had should have been enough proof too. 

2 weeks after this encounter I moved to a new home in another state and sold everything I had incase it's traces were on them. The entire journey I was praying that it doesn't follow me any longer and I can live life peacefully just as I had always dreamed. I got in the moving truck and had a driver incase I saw it and had a panic attack. The entire way he looked worried about me, sometimes stopping to buy me something cold to calm me down a bit. After a long way I finally reached my home and settled in. 

The creature hasn't made any sound for about 6 years I am pretty sure it has gone away. Thank god I can finally keep my head at rest.

I celebrated too early. 2 days ago I heard the same yelps again, I looked out the window and there it was. This time it was digging a hole in the dirt. I don't know why it's doing this and I am not sure if it's sending me some signal or something but it's definitely not something good. This time it stayed for much longer, 2 days instead of 12 hours. I don't know why it's following me I just want to be peaceful, I want to sleep without nightmare of it, I want to stop being stressed, I want to invite someone over to my house without worrying about it killing them, I want my hands to stop trembling, I want someone to tell me they see it too and that it's harmless but most of all I just want to be alone. 

I have decided to work from home and I will now be fully isolating myself in this home until the day I die. Maybe it won't see me as a threat if I don't move too much and won't harm me. I will inspect the hole first though, I want to know what's in it.

The hole contains nothing, but it felt like it was pulling me in screaming at me jump in it and never leave it. The dirt was swirling about, some of it turning into mud in front of me without any water present. I don't understand anything anymore. I used to be known as the helpful funny IT guy now nobody knows me. I haven't talked to my family in years, I don't know if most of them is even still alive. I want to be safe again, I want to be thinking about what I am eating for dinner not why I am trying to bury myself alive, everything is falling apart and I can't control a single part of it. 

I will one day leave this home, maybe it will die after a couple years. If you see this, please tell me if you experienced something like this before. I don't want to be even more alone.

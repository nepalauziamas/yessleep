Do you remember the first time you smoked weed? Did you get super high and order one of everything off the McDonald’s dollar menu? Maybe you passed out and woke up with a dick drawn on your face with a permanent marker. Or perhaps you were like, “huh, not for me.”

Even though it was over twenty, I remember the first time that Mary Jane popped my cherry like it was yesterday.

It was a Saturday night, and I was hanging out with some of my buddies. As with most teens, we didn’t have much money, so walking around Long Island City was one of our favorite pastimes.

Anyway, like I was saying, it was a Saturday, and I was walking around with my buddies, shooting the shit, enjoying the cool night air.

Somebody pulled a joint from their wallet and asked if we wanted to smoke. Everyone else was like, “fuck yeah bro, let’s hit that shit,” but I was hesitant.

It wasn’t the first time I had been exposed to weed. One of the neighborhoods I grew up in was full of potheads, and they used to take a break from playing basketball to “pass the dutchie ‘pon the left hand side.”

While I never felt obligated or had the desire to smoke during those basketball sessions, I felt an insane amount of peer pressure when I was with my friends. I guess it was because I wasn’t just hanging out with some randos, but people I’d known for years.

So, when the joint was passed to me, I took it and toked it aaaaaaand, it was fucking amazing. I don’t even have the words to describe it, but I’m going to try.

Imagine a million tiny little pinpricks all over your body, but instead of feeling pain, it caused you to giggle a little. Like if you were transported to 1st century China and received acupuncture from the OGs.

After the joint became a roach too small to hold without tweezers, we ate some chicken wings and French fries, and I went home to sleep like a baby.

I didn’t get high again until a few months later, but the experience was not the same.

After work, I hung out with a coworker, and he packed a blunt with some sour. We smoked it, and I was disappointed at first, but it hit me like a ton of bricks while riding the train home. It went from zero to one hundred real quick, and I had a very unpleasant experience. However, I didn’t let that deter me from reaching for the sky again.

Because I was working, I had some disposable income, and I started buying weed regularly. At first, I had people buy it for me, and then I bought it from them. That was until I met Tyrone.

He was new on the scene, and some of my smoking buddies had high praise for his bud. Tyrone also offered discounts when you bought two or more eighths. So, I reached out to him, and we met up the following day.

Tyrone was a chill dude, and he did not disappoint. His flower was fire, and I started buying from him exclusively.

In time, Tyrone became more than just a guy I bought pot from; he became my Saul Silver, minus all the violence.

That friendship came with some pretty sweet benefits, too.

Tyrone was also an experimental horticulturalist and liked creating new strains through crossbreeding. Whenever his ‘frankenstein’ plants were ready, he’d call me and ask me to rate his work. In a sense, I was his beta reader.

Not all his creations were successes, though, but he definitely had more hits than misses.

Tyrone called me one day and said he had a masterpiece on his hands and was eager to share it with me, and he wasn’t lying. He called the new strain *Sustainable Satisfaction*, and the high lasted for hours. It felt like I swam through the clouds and gave god a high-five.

The best part about the new hybrid strain was that I didn’t get the munchies. It was like eating tofu that tasted like General Tso’s Chicken.

When I asked Tyrone if he could hook me up with some, he gave me half an ounce. I offered to pay him, but he said I had been such a loyal customer that it was on the house, and I wasn’t going to turn down free weed.

About a week later, I started to develop a rash on my left forearm. Initially, I attributed it to the fact that I had started to make my homemade detergent, but even after switching back to store-brand, the rash didn’t clear up.

It was a minor inconvenience at first, but then the rash spread to my shoulder, chest, and stomach.

The itchiness came next, and nothing I tried provided much relief. The relief was only temporary, whether it was an oatmeal bath, calamine lotion, or aloe vera.

Eventually, I went to a dermatologist, and they performed a litany of allergy tests, but they all came back negative. I was asked if anything was different with my diet, but the only change was smoking *Sustainable Satisfaction.*

“I doubt it’s that, but it wouldn’t hurt to take a break and see if the rashes start to clear up. In the meantime, you can try taking Benadryl and Hydrocortisone ointment.”

I didn’t think it was the weed either, but as the dermatologist said, it wouldn’t hurt. I smoked the fattest joint when I got home and passed out on the couch.

I woke up starving the following morning. I looked in my fridge, but nothing seemed to shout out, “eat me because I’ll satiate your appetite,” so I went outside to look for food. I walked and walked, but nothing seemed to draw me in until I passed by a green smoothie bar.

Something about the aroma coming from that place drew me in as if I had bit the bait on a fishing line.

The absolute bonkers thing was that, up until that point, I had never had a green smoothie before, nor had I ever desired to have one.

The smell inside was magical, and I immediately started to drool once I crossed the threshold. I stared at the aromatic collection of leafy greens and fruits. The spinach and rhubarb were calling out to me, so I had that made into a smoothie along with apples and bananas. It tasted divine and satisfied my hunger.

Those smoothies soon became my only source of food. There were days that I would consume six. Yes, my change in appetite was concerning, but with each passing day on my smoothie diet, I would itch less and less. It seemed like a win-win situation to me.

Unfortunately, I woke up with a lump on my left forearm about two weeks ago. It was in the same spot where the rash appeared the first time. It was hard to the touch and felt like I was pressing down on a sandbag.

I called the dermatologist right away and scheduled an appointment for this Friday.

Tyrone was the next person that I called. It had been a few weeks since I’d spoken to him, and I wanted to see if he had been experiencing the same things. An unfamiliar voice picked up the phone.  I asked for Tyrone, and they became apprehensive, so I explained that I had known him for a while and wanted to check on him. They said that Tyrone went to help his friend move a week ago but had not come back, and all attempts to reach him had failed.

It was unlike Tyrone to go off the grid like that, and I was worried about him.

I asked if they’d see any lumps on Tyrone’s body, and they said they didn’t know.

I wanted to report Tyrone missing, but I doubted that the cops would’ve cared about a missing drug dealer. I also didn’t want to chance it and bring unnecessary heat to his operation if there was nothing wrong with him.

I hung up the phone, applied some ointment to the lump, and went about my day.

There were more lumps on my forearm the following day, and one felt like it was forming on my stomach. Each was red, and tiny droplets of a darkish green puss slowly leaked out when I scratched them.

I decided that I needed to go to the dermatologist and see if they could fit me in. Unfortunately, I tripped and landed face-first in the dirt in my rush. It got in my nostrils and mouth, but I did not recoil in disgust.

The taste of the dirt was intoxicating, and I started to chew, slowly shoveling handfuls of dirt and worms into my mouth until people gasped at the disgusting sight. I quickly got up, wiped my face off, and walked away.

But I needed more. This overwhelming need to consume dirt came over me, and I went to the hardware store to buy a couple of bags of potting soil. Next, I went to a pet shop, got some worms, and headed home.

I opened a bag of soil and dumped the worms in and proceeded to devour the mixture like a bag of Pringles. I passed out on the couch and woke up in the tub, naked and halfway submerged in the soil.

Several lumps on my body and layers of skin peeled off as I scratched at them feverishly, revealing brown flesh crawling with all types of bugs, and I passed out at the horrid sight.

I woke up to find pulsating veins protruding from my stomach. I traced them to see that they were buried in the soil, and I passed out again.

Several heat lamps were shining down on me when I opened my eyes again. Although they were bright, I had no problem adjusting my vision to them, and my body welcomed their warmth.

The soil I was in was also damp as if someone had turned the shower on while I was unconscious.

Open wounds were visible everywhere now, and each had a network of veins and tiny stems coming out of them.

I tried to move my body and climb out of the soil and tub, but the only thing that didn’t offer resistance was my arm, and curiously, I was holding a cellphone.

I don’t know what’s happening to me or how much longer I have left, but please hear me out. If you happen to come across Tyrone and he offers you a free half-ounce of *Sustainable Satisfaction*, don’t take it. Or maybe your experience will be different. It gave me the best high I had ever had and it is totally worth it.

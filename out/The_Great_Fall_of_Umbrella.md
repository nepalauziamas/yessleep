Dear Mr. Reed

On behalf of the Spencer Memorial Hospital, we would like to offer you the opportunity to work as a pharmaceutical epidemiologist. We have taken notice of your outstanding grades and exeptional discipline as well as your keen ability to conduct research and provide detailed reports. With time and dedication you may very well be our most valued asset.  Our hospital offers state of the art technology and fine comforts for those employed. Our current technology is crafted from the finest of elements. Our senior staff, hand picked from all across the world.. We take great honor in our beginnings and our foundation. The betterment of mankind rests with Umbrella.

I clenched the letter in my hands and began crying. I have spent years of my life emptying bed pans and changing diapers, only to dwell in this sad run down apartment. I had not believed in god until now. 

I wasted no time in sending them an email, dreaming of my new found life. Eager, I couldn’t help but imagine the high tech they would offer. Perhaps the facilities are akin to a future movie, or maybe they’re working on a cure for Ebola. 

I was emailed back shortly after. 

Dear Mr. Reed

We are so glad you are interested in our cause. I am Dr. Nathaniel Bard. Im the chief researcher and lead coordinator for our clinical trials. I’m so happy to be speaking with you today. I will give you my personal email to address a few key topics

After a while with Dr. Bard we agreed on a formal interview. I would be leaving in three days. I began cleaning my place and packing my clothes.

I quit my job the next day

The days flew by as I gave this city a final goodbye. 

At around 12:30 a black Cadillac pulled up to the curb. I was waiting with all my luggage outside. two men stepped out from the front and nodded to each other. They greeted me and packed my suit cases in the trunk. The ride was astounding as I travelled through beautiful cities and vast open fields. We stayed in a luxurious hotel that night. The service was remarkable, and the scenery was beautiful. I spent the night at the lounge chatting with anyone who came in. Tonight I was living. 

We left for Arklay County in Wisconsin the next day. After driving a hundred miles the car passed a road sign.  Welcome all to Raccoon City, the grand home of Umbrella.

Bard prepared the needle, his hazmat suit kricnkled. The doctor raised the needle and purged the air out.
Eyes began to lower in unison. Perfect silence. 

The needle made contact with the skin.. 
A pale glow illuminated the lot. 
THe Dr slowly pressed theplunger.


A a swab was placed inside thenose. 
A heart monitor on his chest

Everyone stood perfectly still

I fast forwarderd the tape.
the thumbnail changed image. i scrolled back and watched.


The corpsesd eyes opened. 
7 minutes doctor
Heartbeat is now 14 beats a minute.
body temperature 68 degrees 
pupils now dialating

The corpse looked up at the scientists. It’s eyes a grey white . It’s lips cracked and pale.

The creature rose when its restraints held it back. hands bolted down.  It continued to open and close his mouth. It continued to look at the doctors. 

The doctors placed electrograms on its head. 
Testing neurological activity, now

Doctor, you need to see this 

Small activity in the temporal lobe. 

We need more than that

Connors, Bastian, prepare the ECT

A scientist rolled out a machine as the other picked up two large needles 

We are going to attempt a full electroshock

Connors, place the needles

Bastian ready the switch

5 amps

Little change, brain activity has increased slightly 

15 amps

Eyes twitching, perhaps we are close to iliciiting a response

30 amps

Heart rate is picking up, metabolic spike, nervous system functioning

40 amps. 

Cardiovascular system working, blood flowing

50 amps.

Too much, lower it immediately

The corpse began spazzing intensely

The restrains rattled under the violent shaking

Kill the switch doctor

I can’t, the system is malfunctioning.

I’m logged out

Unplug the goddamn computer. 

The doctor tore the cables out of the wall

All the researchers backed up as the convulsions only grew more intense

It’s moaned loudly as if crying from deep within 

Blood began running out its nose, fallowed by its eyes. 

It turned to look at the scientists one last time before stopping all movement

The doctor led the way through the corridor
I approached a sign that read 
“Remain calm in the event of a hospital lockdown. All employees are to evacuate to the main lobby as soon as possible. Discontinue all work, regardless of its importance. Move with haste as your safety will depend on it. If you are unable to evacuate, admit yourself to a room and fallow the lockout contagion procedures. Masks and hazmats will be dispensed during a code red. Do not hesitate to put them on. Patiently wait as a squad from our biohazard division will be sent in to extract you. remain calm and to not panic.”

Don’t let that scare you. The doctor spoke up. Our hospitals have the greatest safety record of any institution.

As we moved through the corridors, I heard the sound of screeching wheels. a crew of nurses rushed out  wheeling a body. They wore hazard masks yet I could see crying through the plastic. . As they rushed through, the nurse in the front stumbled. The trolley jolted to a sudden stop and a foot fell out. The limb was grey and had lost toes to an aggressive necrosis. Bones bolted out like screws. The skin was nobbed and leathery. Why the hell was he covered in towels? 

Bard showed no concern, Stating a trial vaccine was a fluke. This kind of incident is one to be expected. We collect them before a service truck takes them to an incenerator far outside the city.

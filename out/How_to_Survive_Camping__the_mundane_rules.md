[I run a private campground.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/lsn7y9/how_to_survive_camping_a_very_old_war/)  It’s been in the family for generations.  We pass the management of it from descendent to descendent, along with all the customs and stories that come with it.  We also pass along a curse - everyone that has ever managed this land has died to one of the inhuman things that inhabit it alongside us.

For this is old land and that has a weight and a significance to it.  It has rules of its own, separate from the world we understand.  And those rules shape how we live and how we die.

This land is changing.  It is turning ancient.  And someday, one of these inhuman things will claim it and then *they* will write the rules.

If you’re new here, you should *really* [start at the beginning](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/clp5h4/how_to_survive_camping/) and if you’re totally lost, [this might help](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/comments/fz6a1d/how_to_survive_camping_index/).

The campground has actually been peaceful for a little bit since we killed the fomorian.  I wonder if the inhuman things that are trapped here, unable to leave, are relieved.  The fomorians were tyrants that demanded tribute from the creatures they ruled over.  The fomorian would have done the same, had it triumphed and taken the lives of the few that dared stand against it.  The forest certainly seems lighter now that it's gone.  It was like a fog hung over it, heavy in my lungs, and now that has lifted.  I hadn’t even realized its weight until I went walking through the forest and realized that something had changed.

Likely the other creatures that live here feel it as well.

The battle against the fomorian took a heavy toll.  I’ve grieved the loss of the dogs harder than I thought I would.  I find myself crying unexpectedly.  Crying is too light of a word.  It’s like the grief will rip me apart.  I bury my face in a towel and scream.  For the dogs, for my aunt and uncle, for my parents, and for everyone else I’ve ever loved that this land has taken.

The cost is starting to feel too high.  But if I abandon the land now, that will not stop it from turning ancient.  It will merely throw someone else into the sacrificial fire - likely my brother.  And if I’d abandoned it before it turned… that, too, would have been a high cost.  The toll would be taken on countless strangers out in the world, naïve and vulnerable to the creatures that would be unleashed from their cage.

It is cold comfort.

At least Bryan is still alive.  There is that.  I’m trying not to be too sad for him.  He did something few of us have.

He left.

This town… it brings people back to it.  There’s plenty of reasons for that - familiarity, family, or economic circumstances - but most of us never leave at all and the ones that do inevitably return.  Even my brother Tyler, who had no desire to someday own this land, has found its snare tightening around him.  I find myself feeling almost relieved for Bryan.  I hope he’s with his great-grandmother’s people.  I hope he’s happy.

I hope he can forgive the rest of us for the part we played in all of this.

The old sheriff has purchased the land that the ruined church stands on.  I didn’t think he had that kind of money, but perhaps the land was cheaper than I thought on account of it being of little use.  Or perhaps his wife had something to do with it.  I’m certain she could negotiate a hefty discount on his behalf.

They’re going to put up a fence but otherwise keep it exactly as it is.  He just wants to make sure the graves and the flowers that cover them remain undisturbed.  If his wife helps, I’m sure no one will be able to desecrate them for a long, long time.  Perhaps until the end of the earth itself.

Despite the grieving, the past few weeks have been quiet.  I was grateful for the reprieve.

So naturally, it didn’t last.

I’ve been so focused on the second set of rules that I’ve completely neglected the first set.  They’re not terribly interesting though, right?  They’re just useful, practical stuff.  Things that people that don’t camp very often may not know.  I made the list for mostly selfish reasons.  If someone has a bad time at my campground because their tent collapses or they break an ankle tripping over a line, then they’re unlikely to come back.  If they don’t come back, then I lose out on all that sweet, sweet revenue.  It’s in my best interest to ensure people have a good camping experience.

Though just as we’ve seen, people don’t read rules.  That’s why my camp store carries tent repair kits.

I feel compelled to bring up these rules because as I’ve discovered, when enough people disregard them it can cause significant problems for me.  So let’s recap, shall we?

Rule #9 - Pack some heavy blankets. It can get cold at night.

The campground isn’t open yet.  The weather is above freezing, but nights are still dropping into the low forties.  No sense in opening when no one is going to want to actually be out here in that sort of weather.  Besides, there’s still snow in the deep woods.  It’s taking its sweet time melting.  Might have something to do with that being the lowest point of my land, I guess.  Anyway, we’re not open, but since my camp budget is a little tight right now… I can be persuaded.

I got a call from someone who introduced himself as “the best man” and in desperate need of a location to throw a bachelor’s party.  He’d rented a bar for an evening but then the health inspector made a surprise visit and shuttered the place.  He hadn’t been able to get a hold of the owner and was afraid he wouldn’t get his money back at all.  He’d seen the sign by the highway for my campground and thought maybe they could do that instead.  Go camping and he’d bring a lot of beer.

I explained that it would be cold.  He claimed that would be fine.  They were probably going to be up most of the night, anyway.  I made a mental note that I’d need staff to check on their site a couple times to make sure no one was passed out drunk in the open.  I was only half-listening to his story at this point, mentally tallying up how much it would take to let him host a private event during our off-season.  I waived my inconvenience fee though, as I wanted the money more than I wanted to not have to deal with him.

The inconvenience fee never shows up on the invoice.  It’s built into the base charge for your event and it is entirely based on how much of a hassle I think you’re going to be.  If you’re too much work, the fee is meant to scare you off.

I gave him a number, expecting him to reject it.  Even our base price can be a little surprising to people who think it’s just an open field, surely it won’t cost much to host a big group.  He accepted without hesitation.  Either he was unable to book another place on short notice or he’d really sold himself on this whole camping bachelor’s party idea.  Or… it seemed cheap in comparison to his earlier venue.

I didn’t want to ask him how much he paid to rent the bar, but I’ve got a feeling he got taken for a ride.

I called up some of my staff and asked if they wanted hours that week.  A few days later we were opening up the campground gate as a handful of cars packed with people rolled through.  My staff greeted them cheerfully, offering to show them to their campsite and telling them the camp store would be open with a limited supply if they’d found they’d forgotten anything.  The bachelor party probably took it as small town friendliness, but the reality was my staff saw them the same way I did.

Walking paychecks.

Look - I run a business here.  And I need a new four-wheeler.

We’d had rain off and on through the week.  Between that and the melting snow, the ground was thoroughly soaked.  My staff warned them to drive the stakes as deep as they could and to not pitch any tents in low areas.  Then once they were out of earshot of the campers, they radioed to warn me that we might need to reinforce their stakes at some point.

Rule #3 - If the ground is soft from heavy rain, reinforce tent stakes either by weighing them down or by using longer stakes. They can get pulled out of the ground by a strong wind, otherwise.

We’ve got some stakes that go down deep and can hold onto soggy ground.  Ed showed up with them one day.  I’m not sure where he found them and they’re hard to describe, but we’ve got them, and we sometimes loan them out.  Usually to campers we know come back year after year, so that they don’t go permanently missing.  I told my staff they could get them out but only if a tent collapsed first.

I didn’t think they’d get deliberately stolen.  I did think they’d get accidentally packed up by a bunch of hungover campers that didn’t realize what they were doing.

Then we all left them alone.

I got about two hours of decent sleep before the storm hit.  The rain slamming against the window woke me up.  I got up and pulled open the curtains to look.  I was expecting it, so the sight of the little girl’s face pressed against the glass, her tears obscured by the rain running down her face, didn’t startle me.  I stared over her head at the yard beyond.  The rain was coming in thick sheets, blown by the howling wind.

20% chance of rain tonight.  Sure.  That worked out for us.

Briefly, I considered going back to bed.  The bachelor party had received the pamphlet.  It wasn’t my problem if they were woefully unprepared for camping.  But if they had a good experience the first time, despite the storm… if they went home and told their friends what a lovely campsite it was and how helpful the staff are… I could possibly get some repeat campers or even new campers from word of mouth.

I thought of my four-wheeler as I pulled on some jeans.  New four-wheeler.  That’s what this was all for.

Parts of the road were already turning into mud.  I drove slowly, as visibility was poor and there were some parts of the campground where the water poured into the ditch and formed a channel that would trap even a pickup truck’s tire.  We had a tractor that we used to pull cars out with, but I did not want to be getting it out in a storm like this.

Rule #7 - Cheap tents and pop-ups from Walmart are not designed for weather. One strong breeze is enough to collapse or flip them. If you insist on using a pop-up, weigh it down and stake it so it doesn’t turn into a hazard when it goes flying off.

My heart sank as I approached the campsite where the bachelor’s party was located.  Flashlight beams danced about haphazardly.  They were all awake.  That didn’t bode well.  Sure enough, as I pulled the truck in to their site I saw that their tents were all flattened.  They lay in soggy heaps of nylon as the young men stumbled about, trying to find poles and stakes in the dark or trying to drag their belongings out.  They had one umbrella between all of them.  I parked the pickup alongside them and rolled down the window, yelling at them to throw all their stuff in the back and then get in.  I’d take them to the barn.  Then I got on my phone and called up the old sheriff and asked if he could scrounge up bedding for a bunch of people.  Told him to call my extended family members if he needed to.

By the time the bachelor’s party got their belongings loaded up, the old sheriff had already dropped his wife off on site.  When we reached the barn, she was there with a couple space heaters warming up the vast room and had a gas camp range heating up water for tea and hot chocolate.

“They’re *soaked*,” she commented, coming to talk to me as I rolled the barn door shut behind the pickup.

“Soaked and drunk,” I grunted.  “We need to get them warm.”

“I’ll tell my husband to bring some changes of clothing with the blankets.”

Rule #1 - Have a sturdy, waterproof container that holds a spare change of clothes and a blanket. This will ensure you have something warm and dry if your tent floods.

She returned to the stove.  I turned my attention to the group of men milling about aimlessly.  After some yelling, I got them to start unloading the pickup.  Then once it was empty, I asked for a headcount.  They stared at me with some confusion at first.

“No seriously,” I said.  “Headcount.  NOW.  It was dark and you were all disoriented.”

And very clearly drunk.

They came up short one.  The groom.  They’d left the groom behind.

Of course they did.

I swore under my breath and rolled the barn door back.  Told the sheriff’s wife to handle things from here for me.  Then I took the truck back out into the storm.

There was sleet coming down now.  It was melting as soon as it hit the ground, but it didn’t bode well for someone stuck outside with no shelter.  The temperature was above freezing, but with the wind and being wet hypothermia was still a possibility.

People think it’s safe because this isn’t backpacking out into the mountains, days from civilization.  And yes, the camp emergency line is right there and there’s always 911 if things get dire, but that doesn’t mean things can’t go *wrong*.  None of them had called the emergency line and judging by the state of their tents and clothing, it was likely that their phones were going to be ruined after this.

So now this man was out wandering an unfamiliar forest in the dark, possibly going in circles, with the clock ticking against how long he could survive as the sleet thickened.  I drove slowly, hoping he would see the headlights and come towards them.  It would be hard to see him in the dark, otherwise, if he wasn’t carrying a flashlight himself.  I circled their campsite before turning the truck down towards the old woods.  He could have followed the lights, I supposed.  They’d not followed any of the sensible rules, so why would he follow the strange ones?

I wish Bryan were still here.  It would have been easier.  We would have set the dogs loose to track him down.  They could have, despite all the rain.  My heart ached at the thought.

My search grew ever wider as time passed.  I began to feel a bit of desperation.  Now that I’d decided to help them, I was invested in the outcome.  I needed to find him before something worse happened to him.  But the longer the search went on, the more time he had to wander further and further from the site and the more area I had to look through.

Finally, I found myself at the edge of the deep woods.  My truck idled on the road as I stared at the forest, past the layer of rain and sleet that my wipers futilely tried to sweep away.  The snow sat thick on the ground still.  Surely he wouldn’t have gone down there.

Surely.

I was close to the thing in the dark.  I peered through the storm, wondering if it was still dormant.  And I saw him.  He stood only a few yards away from the mound.  His back was to the road.

I practically fell out of the truck and ran towards him, yelling to get his attention.  The wind roared in my ears and I’m not sure if he heard me.  He just stood there, staring at the mound.  When I reached him, I grabbed his shoulder and pulled him back.  He was reluctant to move, his head turning to keep his eyes on the thing in the dark as long as he could.

“It’s… breathing,” he said.

“It’s alive,” I growled.  “I’ll explain it later.  We need to leave.”

The earth was *trembling*.  I felt it beneath my feet.  Perhaps he misinterpreted it as being hilariously drunk and the world was spinning for him, but I felt the vibration.  The thing in the dark was waking up.

I’ve seen someone get swallowed up by the thing in the dark before.  I saw what she became, after years and years of wandering in those dark hallways.  I seized him and began to haul him back towards the truck.

The snapping of branches echoed in the air above even the wind and the rain.  I grabbed the man by the back of his hair and forced his head down so that he was staring at the ground.  He protested, briefly, but then froze, motionless save for violent trembling.  For behind us, there was a roar.  Like a falling tree, but it modulated in pitch and intensity, like the yawn of some immense creature.

Which was exactly what it was.

And I… I had happened to choose that moment to look behind us.

It was like I was paralyzed.  Something locked onto my gaze and refused to let me look away.  I could not even blink.  It drew me in like a whirlpool and the world around me felt like it no longer existed, hazy in the edge of my vision.  I saw *beyond*, into a forest of ashen trees and beyond even that, to a field of dust and bones and the feathers that stretched to the horizons and blotted out the gray sky.

I felt like I would fall inside.  Like the world had tilted sideways and I was falling along the ground, sliding towards the destruction that waited beyond.

Then the thing in the dark rose and shook itself and the world turned itself right-side up again.  I saw its shapeless head rise, a mass of sticks and leaves on a long neck.  I saw the roll of its shoulders and the curve of its spine - and then I squeezed my eyes shut as tight as I could as its eyeless gaze fell on me.

“I’m sorry!” I cried.  “Something - happened.  I couldn’t - I couldn’t-”

“CAMPGROUND MANAGER,” it roared and the trees shook.  “I dreamed.  Tell me why I dreamed.”

“I - uh, what?”

“I slept and I dreamed.  Of rot and anguish and despair.  I do not dream.”

It stepped closer and the ground shook violently.  Beside me, the groom crumpled to his knees, sobbing and clutching at his ears.  I didn’t let go of the back of his head, keeping his gaze forced at the ground.

“Tell me why I dreamed,” it repeated.

I did.  I told it of the fomorian and of the thorns that riddled its body.  How the spiders had helped fight them off and how Beau had taken the stone and freed it of them.  And how we killed the fomorian.

I told him of Bryan and the dogs.

It listened to it all and its steady breathing sounded like the rattling of stones.  Then it shifted and moved away.  I listened to the scrape of branches along the ground and only let go of the camper beside me when the only noise I could hear was that of the storm.  I was thoroughly soaked as well now.  I was shivering so hard my teeth chattered. Beside me, the camper wasn’t shivering at all.  That wasn’t a good sign.

He reeled, standing upright, and stared at me with wide eyes in a pale, pinched face.  He opened his mouth to speak but for a moment, no words came out.  I sighed.  Maybe he’d forget all this by morning.  I could smell the alcohol on his breath, even with the rain falling all around us.

“You-you’re friends with - monsters!” he finally gasped.

“Well, sort of, I guess,” I sighed.  “Look, it’s fine-”

That’s all I got out before he tried to hit me.  Naturally, I knocked his blow aside and then punched him in the gut as hard as I could.  He dropped at my feet, wheezing noisily.

I mean, what kind of campground manager would I be if I couldn’t knock down a drunk guy?

I wondered if I could convince the old sheriff’s wife to get them blackout drunk before the night was over so they’d forget all this.  Or maybe just… make them forget without the alcohol.  Seemed like something she could do.

A cold wind blew against my back.  It wasn’t the wind from the storm.  It came in the opposite direction of the rain, running up the length of my spine and onto my neck.  I whirled, my breath stopping in my chest.  It felt like fingers.  Cold, dead fingers stroking my hair.

Nothing was behind me.  Far in the distance I could see the darkness between the trees of the deep woods and the gleam of the lingering snow on the ground.

It felt like the forest was watching me.  Like the sudden cold gust had been a sigh.

I shivered violently, once, and hurried to hoist the groaning camper to his feet.  Time to go.  He swayed and I threw his arm over my shoulders, encouraging him to put one foot in front of the other.  I’d take him to the barn, I said, and get him warmed up.  We had blankets and space heaters and hot cocoa.

“Are there… marshmallows?” he asked in the glazed manner of someone who is incredibly drunk.

“Sure.  We’ll have marshmallows and cocoa.”

“That sounds… great.”

And then he doubled over and vomited all over my shoes.

Walking.  Paycheck.

It’s my coping mechanism for having to deal with these sorts of things.

The rest of that night turned into babysitting a bunch of drunk and hapless campers.  The old sheriff got them dry clothing, his wife got food and hot beverages into them, and I made up piles of blankets for them on the cement floor.  It wouldn’t be comfortable, but it would be warm and dry.  The groom had calmed down considerably after being reunited with his friends.  He didn’t say anything about monsters.  He just drank his hot chocolate and nodded off before any of the others.  I left a camp radio with them - as their cellphones were dead from the rain - and told them to use it if they needed anything.  Then we all left.  The old sheriff and his wife took their camp stove and went home.

And I… I returned to my house to await the dawn.

I said earlier that the campground was enjoying some uncharacteristic peace.  There’s one exception.

The beast.

I’ve mentioned before that I’m an early riser.  It’s been my habit for a long time.  But how did that habit get started?  It wasn’t something I consciously trained myself to do.  It’s not that I’m a natural morning person, either.

I’ll tell you.

I wake because I’m afraid of the beast.  I feel it, at the edge of my sleep, and it stirs me awake.  I know, even in my dreams, that my death approaches.

Something has changed since that night with the fomorian.  I have no doubt that the beast came because of me.  I didn’t know such a thing was possible.  And ever since that night… I feel the beast’s presence more keenly than I ever have.  I sit in my bed and shake in fear, not just because I now know that it is the third creature that can claim my land, that it will try to take my life and take the campground into its control as well.

It seems… aware of me.

I’m afraid because it is not just here for the little girl.  It knows I’m here and it wants me as well.

Nothing else has changed.  It drags the girl away and vanishes with the sun.  It cannot enter the house.  These are the things I tell myself, when I feel it approaching, when I feel its malice in my very bones.

I’m a campground manager.  I have very few people left that can help me now.  I have a campground to run, a budget deficit to recover, and a bunch of campers that are going to make my life harder.  Whether it’s a collapsed tent or blundering off into the woods after that shiny blue orb that stays just out of reach, they’re going to read my rules in one moment and then disregard them the next.  And if this little bachelor’s party is any indication, it’s going to be a *great* year for that.

Especially if the bachelor’s party comes back, as they promised they would when they left.  The scarier parts of their camping trip became a grand adventure in the morning light.  They might just have to try camping again, they said.

Can’t.  Wait. [\[x\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/)

I know it's been awhile, but it hasn't been safe enough to keep my eyes off the surrounding area. I haven't slept much at all for the past week or so and it's really starting to have a toll on me. Luckily, the zealots recently left, so I have managed a few hours of shut-eye.

For what it's worth; they never discovered me. I can't believe it myself, but they never once even hinted towards the thought of surveying the area. Not ONCE did any of them come remotely close to my book shelter; it was like they didn't even know it was there. I'm surprised just as much as you are - whoever might be reading this.

I spent most of the time listening to their conversations. There was a lot of talk about large movements of their "congregation" from one area to another and that this area had been "tapped" of resources. Whatever that means. I got a real good look at them too and for all intents and purposes; they look just like us. Human, I mean.

The only difference being the multitude of archaic tattoos and scarification on their bodies, specifically the face. Unfortunately, since I haven't been able to leave my shelter; it's been completely soiled. I'll have to either make a new one somewhere, or risk scouting the library for a more suitable living situation.

Perhaps the latter will be more beneficial in the end. If anyone has been following along, I apologize for my lack of engagement. I am unable to see any sort of response despite my phone telling me there have been comments. Something about this library is preventing me from seeing any of it, like it wants me to feel isolated. I'm not sure.

So I've finally abandoned my shelter. Despite finally being free of all my haunts and menaces, I couldn't stay there any longer. I had outgrown the area and because of the amount of time I've been here - I've begun to think on more permanent terms.

My ultimate goal was to find a way to live up high, perhaps on the top of a large bookcase somewhere. I remembered seeing some near the massive book door that I was never able to explore due to the tall man. But, since I haven't seen him in who knows how long, I figured I could now safely search for that section.

By some stroke of luck, I actually found that area again. Lo and behold, there were several towering book shelves perfectly viable for living on AND one of them had a ladder. It was a good thing I climbed up before observing the surrounding area because a group of those zealots marched by with crudely fashioned weapons.

This has been going on routinely like some sort of patrol for the last like… ten hours? It has made it exceedingly difficult to start constructing my new home of permanence, but they have to sleep sometime, right?

Finally, I was given time to explore the surrounding area enough to learn that I was in the prime spot for a residence. I discovered another room similar to the break room near my old shelter that housed a whole brand new array of vending machines as well; it was close too, close enough to be viable. Better yet, a bathroom lies right next to it, so I've got all the bases covered.

I've begun construction on the new shelter too. It's been hard to lug the larger books up the ladder, but it has been rewarding as well. I actually find fulfillment in building what will soon be my place of living. Luckily the top of the book shelf is roughly twenty feet wide and probably more than fifty feet long; it makes for a wonderful platform of solidity.

One more thing, because I'm higher up, it's warmer. Heat rises after all and therefore, I don't have to worry about being cold that often. Hopefully, at least.

New Entry: 11

Construction has been eventful. I'm almost done with the first iteration which will likely be expanded upon in the future. I'm proud of what I've built and the fact that I've not had a run in with anything terrifying has me in high spirits. I apologize for the drastic amount of time it's taking me to update you, but time just doesn't work the same way for me here. I have no idea what day it is, how long it's been or even when the last time I slept was.

It's honestly a miracle I'm even still alive.

New Entry: 12

You won't believe this, but the big book door? The one I couldn't move? Yeah, well; it opened. By opened, I mean it slid open just enough for a person to slip through and I'm pretty sure I saw someone leave. I waited and watched for them to return but I started to get tired and probably missed them after passing out.

Recently, I accepted that I'll never get out of here. I've been coming to grips with the possibility of spending the rest of my days scurrying about like a fearful rat searching for any number of scraps just to stay alive day to day. I hadn't thought about food, water or any of my other survival necessities since leaving my last shelter and it made me wonder if I needed any of it anymore.

Of course I did, my stomach rumbling didn't lie.

Luckily, there were plenty of vending machines nearby. I just had to descend the bookshelf every time I wanted to get something from them, so I thought about finding a way to make something to carry vast amounts of food and drink in one trip. Efficient AND effective.

Maybe I can learn how to make something from a book around here?

Five days. It's been five days since I've last written anything down and things are… bad.

All of my food has rotted. The vending machines in this area have stopped working entirely and a new horror has emerged from the abyss of the library.

It's hard to describe. Not quite man and not quite… zombie? There are several of them, always groaning like the living dead but with an affinity for standing at the base of my ladder. They don't seem to be highly intelligent because they haven't tried to climb up to me yet, but, I haven't given them a reason to suspect I'm up here.

Unfortunately, I'm going to starve if I don't do something soon.

But, there's hope.

I've seen people going in and out of that big book door. Alive. They leave with an empty sack and return with it brimming with supplies. I haven't tried to make my presence known because I don't want those things to hear me, but everyday I think about just shouting across the massive space between me and the door with the hope of being saved.

That's probably a bad idea, but bad ideas are just about all I have left.

I must be losing my mind. I could have sworn I saw a sprawling human collective beyond that big book door. I've been so fixated on it, I even resorted to attempting to throw something whenever I see someone leave. 

I've learned their gathering schedule and it might be my saving grace. I think I'm going to wait until one of their groups is about to return and then I'll try to run over to them, maybe I can join their… whatever it is? I can only hope.

New Entry: 15

The zombies or whatever have finally shambled far enough away for me to make a move. I actually waited behind a pillar close to the big book door for it to open, but the problem was; it never did. I thought I knew their schedule, but all it did was make me further question my own sanity.

I waited for hours on end for a sign of life, but none came. I was forced to retreat back to my new shelter which, as it stood, felt far inferior to my first one. I kind of missed it.

There was an issue though. My ladder had somehow broken while I was away. I don't know how, or if someone (or something) did it, but I'm royally screwed if I'm stuck out here for too long.

I've nestled myself in a crevice between two adjoining bookshelves. The space is just big enough for me to sit down; it isn't comfortable, but at least I feel safe. 

I'm going to try to rest my eyes for a while now.

My wait was worthwhile! I was awoken by the sound of the door opening and standing at its base were two people! Both of them appeared to be women and they seemed to be having some sort of disagreement (although it was too faint to hear.) I quickly made my presence known because I didn't know when I'd get another chance. Naturally, they were both startled and each of them produced makeshift weapons in an attempt to keep me at bay.

I held my hands out and tried to calm them down, "Wait! Please listen… I've been stuck here for so long now, I don't even know how long it's been! Help me, please, I promise I can contribute to whatever you might have going on behind there…" I gestured with my head towards the book door.

One of them lowered their weapons and started to confer with the other. After about two minutes they both turned to me and for the first time since being here, I heard the voice of another genuine human being. "We've been watching you. You do good work and you seem to know how to survive." The voice was soothing and notably feminine.

"I'm not a survivalist!" I said quickly, "I just read a lot and know how to apply practical logic to most situations. Most of the time my survival is based on pure luck! That's… my opinion anyway…"

"I don't think so." Said the second, who also had a feminine voice. "You outwitted the man, you know the one."

"The tall one?" I did no such thing! He nearly broke my arm and if I'm being honest, I have no idea what happened to him!"

They turned towards each other again. There was some conversation between them before the first one to speak said, "Come with us. It's not safe to talk out here for long."

The second chimed in, "You can't bring that with you." They pointed past me at something I was unaware of. 

When I turned around, I saw Mrs. James.

I jumped and felt my heart skip. I immediately turned to face the two presumably women and explained, "It's not with me. It's been following me since I got here. I don't know what it wants, but I know it looks an awful lot like the librarian who worked at the library in my hometown."

"It can't come with you. The rest would vote to kill it and we can't in good conscience let that happen."

"What do you mean, do you know what it is?"

"Yes and no. We know that these entities exist all throughout the Librarynth and that they often latch onto a host. As far as we are aware; they don't seem to be hostile but others might disagree. So it can't. Come. With." The woman was being extremely serious based off the tone in her voice, but I didn't really know what to do about Mrs. James.

I turned around to face her and said, as gentle as could be, "Hello, Mrs. James? I can't have you following me anymore. I appreciate the fact that you haven't tried to hurt me yet, not like everything else here, but these people won't let me into safety unless you stay out here. So, if it's me you want, then please consider waiting for me to come back out, if I do."

I don't know what I expected, but nothing happened. Mrs. James just stood still without any movement whatsoever. I didn't know if she even heard me anyway. But, whether she did or didn't, I wasn't going to let her stop me from finding salvation.

I slowly turned away from her and began to walk towards the big book door. My speech to Mrs. James must have been satisfactory for the two women because they let me in even though there wasn't any sort of response. For that, I was grateful.

I know it's been a long time, but I've been living amongst the people stuck in Shakespeare for a couple of weeks now. That's what they call the place beyond the door. I asked if it had anything to do with the famous poetical playwright and the hierarchy said that someone from his time actually founded the town. Ever since its foundation, it has suffered attacks from both the library and the faction of Laturiam that are stuck here.

I say stuck, but as far as I've learned; they sought to be here. Apparently, the Laturiam worship a being called Bodarum. Bodarum detests the acquisition of knowledge in all forms - especially literature. This library has existed for an indeterminate amount of time and as I understand it, the Laturiam wanted to appeal to their God by summoning it within the library.

But they failed. Instead they breathed life into a long dormant mechanism that manifests evil. That evil in turn seeks to destroy all foreign bodies. That would explain why I've been plagued so heavily by terrifying entities, but it does NOT explain Mrs. James.

I brought her existence up to the hierarchy of Shakespeare and they mentioned another instance of this happening before. Another sorry soul was sucked into the library and left to fend for themselves, but not before being given a sort of… protector.

That's not to say that Mrs. James is good by any means, but it plays into the fact that something, somewhere in this library doesn't desire the death of every living thing within.

Anyway, I've been learning how to acclimate to life here in the library and more particularly, Shakespeare. I've gone on some of the "V-runs" with the other scouts for supplies and they've shown me the ropes on living. Although, they have each expressed their individual surprise in how well I did on my own.

Shakespeare feels safe, but I know it's not. As far as everyone who lives here is concerned? If the library wishes it, the library gets it.

"Wish upon the pages," is the motto amongst the people and it stands for the way almost everyone arrived here. It also, however, stands for everyone's desire to leave. People spend countless hours turning page after page looking for a way out. Some people have accepted their fate and choose instead, to live their best life and I can't blame them.

For what it's worth, I'm content but worried. I want to go back home, but I also enjoy spending time with others who share my love for literacy and knowledge. Plus, the scouts have discovered vending machines that provide FAR more in terms of food variance and miscellaneous items. In fact, some of the people living in Shakespeare have culinary backgrounds, so they've been able to really cook up some quality food that feels like a restaurant.

I guess what I'm saying is, what's not to like?

New Entry: 18

This will be my last entry for now because everyone is worried about an imminent attack. Some of the scouts came back spewing tales of an amassed army of terrifying creatures coming our way. I'm not sure how they know where we are, or why the hierarchy thinks they'll breach the door, but I haven't the status to question their decisions.

Everyone is rushing around in an effort to be useful while I'm sitting here wondering if I made the right decision to join this community. Did it suck living on my own? Yes, but now my life is in someone else's hands and I'm not sure if that brings me comfort or not. I suppose if I'm still alive after what may come, then destiny always planned for me to be here.

There's a lot of commotion near the door now. Farewell and I hope to update you soon.

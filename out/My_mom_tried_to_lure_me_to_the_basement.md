For some context: my home is one fence hop from a cemetery. We have frequent ‘guests’ in our house that mainly stay in the vacant apartment above mine. We haven’t had violent or terrifying experiences with these ‘guests’ for a long time. This was due to an agreement I was told my grandmother made with our ‘guests’. 


My mom told me when I was little that one day when her and her siblings were at school my grandmother had an encounter with one of our ‘guests’. She spoke to it and said “we won’t mess with you if you don’t mess with us”. And that was that. We had nothing notable happen that wasn’t footsteps in the apartment above us and furniture we had up there falling. 


Well I had an event recently. Technically I have had several events but they aren’t as big as this one. Some of my smaller ones being the feeling of being followed and watched 24/7. I cope with this by talking to myself so I can keep my mind off the fact I feel someone behind me. 


One night I had woken up between the hours of two-three am. Not entirely sure exactly anymore because it’s been at least a month since this happened. 


Must also mention I do suffer from night terrors and temporary hallucinations right after I wake up. Such as: black dots in my vision, auditory hallucinations, etc. And my night terrors can get pretty bad and make me hyper aware of my surroundings. And regarding the hallway; I always feel there is something in the hallway. If I’m in the living room, it feels like someone is standing on the bathroom side and if I’m in the hallway it’s on the other end. Just bad vibes in the hallway. 


Anyway. I was woken up by my ‘mom’ telling me to come to the basement with her to help her get ready for work, like she usually does. I wasn’t fully awake yet so I asked her to repeat herself by saying “what?” 


‘She’ repeated by saying “come to the basement”. Fully realizing what’s happening, I was looking in my doorway which leads to a hallway connection two bedrooms (one being mine) and the bathroom to the living room. I saw a dark figure leaning over the gate in my doorway that I assumed was my mom. 


But something was off. 


My mom always turns the hall light on when she does anything in the hallway. 


It wasn’t on this time. 


Nonetheless I got up thinking it was one of the rare occasions where she didn’t turn it on. I walked out to my living room to see my mom asleep on the couch. 


My step dad was up playing on his PlayStation so I asked him if my mom was just awake. He replied with no, that she had been asleep this whole time. 


My blood ran cold and I went back to my room. 


Something wanted me in my basement and it wasn’t my mom. 


Now I often see a dark head in the top left corner of my door when I wake up from my night terrors.

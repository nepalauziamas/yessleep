It's likely you’ve seen a sign that reads like this just off a highway somewhere. Driving around America you’ll find them at the outskirts of mountain towns and ski villages. Places where the snow can fall by the foot and leave you not just stranded but entombed in your Toyota. 

When Lights Flashing: Return to Town. 

I’ve seen those lights flashing once before outside of Breckinridge at the beginning of a blizzard. I turned my truck around, bought a pint of brandy and rented a small cabin with a fireplace. 

There was nothing sinister about those lights then. Their amber flashing wasn’t so much a warning as it was a kind suggestion to sit by a fire and wait out the weather. 

The signs make sense when you see them in the mountains. You wouldn’t look at them twice. But this story doesn’t happen in altitude. And despite our new crazy climate I’ve yet to see snow in the summer.

I haven’t road-tripped for leisure in years now, but I still see those signs from time to time. I’m a part-time government contractor and I got the pretty sweet gig of doing technical work on Minuteman silos. 

What that means is about once a month I take three connecting flights to end up in Fargo or Great Falls or Casper where I’ll drive across the wastes of Wyoming. Once there I descend into dank and musky missile silos to see to it that our finest seventies technology is still ready to bring rapture at a moment’s notice. 

Most the silos are on military bases, but some are simply in the middle of nowhere. Those far out one's, the one’s that take two tanks of gas to get to, those were the silos I’d service. All you’d see is a razor wire fence and what looks like a big bottle cap stuck in the earth. But beneath was a forty-ton missile that can cross a continent like a morning commute. 

The job is fairly simple since it’s all ancient equipment. I know. I know. It’s a terrifying thought to think that America’s nuclear arsenal has arguably less tech than a Tamagotchi but it’s for the best. 

Those clunky cold war machines can’t be hacked. There are no back doors or passwords. Infecting our ICBM network with malware would be like getting a computer virus on a Ham radio. They’re just different species. 

There’s not a lot to what I do but with the age of the systems their parts are always breaking and I find myself answering the phone to go out to Timbuktu far more often than the job posting implied. Still, it was a great break from the engineering consultancy I did 9-5. Whether or not it was worth ten years in the Air Force is a different debate.

24 days ago, I was called to service a silo in southeastern Wyoming. I got a dog sitter and a day later was driving east out of Casper. After a half hour of driving there were already 20-minute gaps between oncoming cars. 

It was a desolate, lonely stretch of the world. A sea of scrub grass and sand colored soil that stretched in every direction the length of entire eastern states. Out there in the plains big shadows of clouds a mile long sat motionless like black lakes. It was as close to nothingness as a landscape could get. No agriculture. No life save antelope that blend into the scrub so well you have to squint to see them. 

Kansas doesn’t hold a candle to those wastes. The true middle of nowhere. Somewhere out there the bones of thousands of ancient hominids. Somewhere out there the home of Courage the Cowardly dog. All the mystic madness of those cartoons that haunted my childhood seemed possible without witness. 

The wind that afternoon soon had me white knuckling the wheel. It roared against the side of the truck and veered me towards the ditch before pitching me violently towards the opposite lane. Whoever bought my plane tickets and set my car rental always gave me a truck, some monstrous machine that was a wind sail for the plains of Wyoming and the Dakota’s. Maybe a mid-sized sedan emasculated some retired military types. Regardless I never got one. 

The wind wasn’t unusual for the area but my flight in had been calm. And when I got in the rental truck it had been calm. It was only twenty minutes outside of Casper that the wind had picked up enough to whip white caps on the cattle ponds yet there were no thunder heads in the western sky it flew from. 

I quickly became anxious as if the weather and the lack of life yelled at some primal part of my mind to hide.  

An hour later I rolled through the town of Lost Springs. Not a soul in the streets, though perhaps that’s not surprising since the welcome sign read: 

Population: 6 

But don’t be fooled there’s a bar and a service station. I looked at the directions I screenshotted that had been emailed to me. Nuclear missile silos don’t have addresses you see. I was to keep heading east towards the city of Lusk but turn south onto a county road before I reached the town proper. 

I hadn’t seen a car in a half hour, and I had such a sick feeling of unease in my stomach from the wind and the nothingness that I thought of going into the gas station to get a candy bar just to see the cashier. But my flight was late, and I’d already be getting to the silo around seven.

I accelerated out of town but began gently depressing the brake a moment later. Ahead was a sign. 

When Lights Flashing: Return to Lost Springs. 

My mouth was slightly agape. The only sound was the tires slowing on the asphalt. I came to a complete stop and stared at the sign. It’s two lights blinked feverishly in tandem. 

“You got to be fucking kidding me.” 

I ducked in the seat so I could squint in every direction. There were only a few stray clouds in the sky. I thought maybe the wind was bringing some serious weather, but still the western sky was empty. I stayed stopped and thought about all the logical reasons those lights could be flashing. 

Where I’m from tornado sirens are tested monthly. Maybe this was Wyoming’s version of that. But they’re tested at noon on the dot. I looked at my watch. It was some random time that seemed unlikely for a test. Past 5 and far from both half past and on the hour. 

5:47. Something of that sort.

The flashing had to be for the wind. Maybe it was a warning for truckers. An empty tractor- trailer could be flipped by wind like this. That had to be it. I waited, hoping another car would roar past me leaving the warning unheeded. And I’d look at their Wyoming plate and be assured that the natives didn’t pay this sign any mind. But no car came. 

I waited another couple minutes in silence hoping they’d stop flashing but on they blinked. I sighed and moved my foot from the brake to the gas and felt my insides sink under an even heavier anxiety. 

Lusk was less than a twenty-minute drive from where I was then, but I was supposed to turn before I reached town. And a town it was, at least compared to Lost Springs. Population 1,000.

It felt ridiculous to turn around to stop at the gas station and ask about the flashing lights. I was sure the attendant would laugh and pity me as some neurotic city type. It felt equally childish to add twenty minutes to the trip by stopping in Lusk. 

And stopping for what? I asked myself. For some reassurance that the world isn’t ending?

“The world isn’t ending you idiot.” I said. I was driving to check up on apocalypse and I knew it would be tucked in tight under its blast door just as it’s been the last fifty years. 

I drove on and my anxiousness had weaned after a dozen miles but when my turn came up I realized that I still hadn’t seen any oncoming traffic. My gut wanted to drive on to Lusk but I gritted my teeth and began to break for my turn. 

“Whatever. Fuck this vacant state.” 

I turned hard onto the county road and the tires squealed and from the power of the vehicle and the smell of rubber I briefly felt some kind of control. 

I accelerated, not caring for cops because for the first time in my life I’d feel relief to so much as see one. I was little more than an hour away, but it seemed to be darkening quickly.

My next bullet point for directions told me to turn onto another county road after 67 miles on the one I was driving on. I had set my mile counter but when an hour or so passed and 67 miles rolled over there wasn’t another county road to turn on. I kept driving thinking maybe the directions were off a little but after another 5 miles with no connecting road I slowed. 

I read the directions carefully. The silo was only 20 miles or so from where I was, and there was a little pin on a satellite map but there was no way the maps on my phone would work well enough out here to get me there. 

I kept driving and after another few minutes my heart lifted when I saw a road. Country road 17 read the little green sign. I looked at my directions. 

They told me to turn right on county road 16.

I looked back up at the sign hoping it would change to 16 when I re-read it. 

“Fuck!”

There was a little manufactured home on the corner of where 17 started and I thought about stopping for directions but when I looked to the window, I saw a flash of curtains as they closed. 

Great, more dread.

I whipped the truck around to look for county road 16 all the while considering that maybe the directions were supposed to say 17. And then of course there’s the possibility that county road 16 is still *past* county road 17 and not before it. But the directions didn’t say that, and the milage counter indicated that 17 was already 6 miles off the mark of 67 miles. 

My head spun and I cursed the United States Government and whatever bureaucrat sent me the god-awful directions. I hit the gas in a racing panic as the plains grew dark. It would get darker still if cloud cover rolled in. A kind of country black I didn’t intend to be lost in. 

But it was night before I knew it and after driving just a little longer a pair of headlights appeared behind me. Maybe if they were oncoming lights, I would’ve felt relief. Instead, it was simply more dread. But the feeling didn’t last long. The truck was already only a few car lengths behind me and had veered into the other lane to pass. I had to slow down for I could hardly see with the trucks LED’s blinding and lightsaber blue. 

Just as it passed and made back into my lane an antelope leaped and vanished in front of the truck. It’s brake lights shined briefly, and the small ungulate was spat out of the tires and sucked under mine. I nearly slammed on the brakes but instead eased into it. But the truck ahead accelerated. 

I watched the pickup in front of me as I slowed. Its driver side mirror was hanging off and flapped madly like a pheasant in a snare. Soon I was stopped, and I watched the taillights ahead dim to dots and then vanish altogether. 

Being in Wyoming I wasn’t sure if what I’d just witnessed wasn’t just a Wyoming thing. I laughed at the ridiculousness of it. A weak laugh, trying to ignore the growing terror. 

Was obliterating roadkill without so much as checking on your truck or the vehicle behind you a common practice? Or, I turned around and looked at the black, was that truck running from something? 

I ignored my gut and got out of the truck. I inspected the fender, the tires. There was some gore spattered here and there but no damage. I walked back across the black top with my phone’s flashlight at my feet to find the carcass. It had been carried by our trucks a good way and I didn’t have to walk more than fifty feet to get to it.

Why’d I walk to it? I don’t know. It was definitely dead. There was hardly anything left. Just a furry ball of gore. 

“Poor thing.” As soon as I said it, I looked up sharply and shone the light around me. Something had bothered my monkey brain. My hairs stood straight, and my heart beat hard. 

What did I hear?

Nothing, I realized. There was nothing to hear and I heard my own voice as well as I would in my head.

There was no wind. No insects. No whistle of an airplane wheeling over this western state. Were there supposed to be crickets in these grasses? I didn’t know the answer, but the silence felt wrong and I started walking quickly to the truck. 

That’s when this becomes disturbed. When my gut and the flashing lights and my general sense of dread were all vindicated at once. 

In the farthest reaches where my headlights shone, where the light ended and the black began, someone was crossing the road. I froze and blinked hard hoping they would vanish. But for another full second, I watched this figure stroll to the other side and disappear again in the dark. It was lank and muscular, appearing almost naked. But what bothered me most was how they walked.

They had crossed casually, not like predator or prey. They hadn’t even glanced my way. I pretended like I hadn’t seen anything and climbed in the cab. 

I shut the door, locked them, and stared out into the dark. 

“Who the fuck…”

That truck was already five miles away and I’d passed this part of the plains when it was still light. The only home in this waste was a dozen miles behind me.

Whoever was out there has been out there for some time. 

I shivered and tears of fear ran from my eyes as I peered into the dark where the figure had wandered. It was in there. Was he watching me?

I wanted to ditch my attempt to find this silo and get a room in Lusk for the night. If I continued straight, I could be there in little more than an hour. Civilization. People. 

My heart sang at the thought of a well-lit hotel lobby. But the road ahead felt like a trap. It was as if that thing had drawn a line across the lanes, one I could not cross. I turned the wheel as far as I could and tapped the gas gently into a U-turn, still putting on the appearance that I hadn’t seen a thing. 

I was going to find that silo. I had 150 miles left on the tank and my pistol I was required to carry. I was fine. Whatever that thing was it wasn’t going catch me going seventy miles per hour. 

But even if I never saw a trace of it again the image of that figure walking those wastes in the black would haunt my thoughts forever. 

After another twenty minutes, I was back at county road 17 and turned on to it slowing as little as I could. The lights of the little home were all off and it wasn’t anything but a lighter outline of darkness against the night. 

I read the directions as I drove. They said that after turning right onto 16 the entrance to the silo was the first left after mile marker 45. Approximately another 20 miles. I assumed the directions simply got the county road wrong and kept driving on. 

I was sick with adrenaline the rest of the way. Tossing in my gut was that horrible sense of inevitable doom that two cups of black coffee on an empty stomach will conjure. I remember jumping in my seat and jerking the wheel when jackrabbits skittered out of the road but have no memory of the last leg of the drive other than that the 20 miles went quick.

I had no trouble finding mile marker 45 and the first left after it. The emailed directions meant 17 not 16 after all. The road was unpaved now and the truck rental was now useful for all of 100 feet of rutted road. At the end of the drive the tall chain link gate was slid back already, and I saw the concrete mound that encircled the blast door. 

The protocol was to be buzzed in. I stopped in front of the intercom box that stood alone in the dirt just off the road and hesitated a moment before rolling my window down. 

Still no sound outside.

“Where’s that fucking wind.” I poked my head out the window looking left and right as if to find it. 

I thumbed the button. “Hello, this is serviceman Lane requesting entry.”

Ahead of me the sideways steel door that led into the silo was illuminated in fluorescent light. There was nothing beyond but black and the sole focus of light on the big cold war door gave the image the lonesome look of an album cover. 

Suddenly static blurted out of the microphone. It stopped after a few seconds.

I hit the button again. “Hey, I can’t hear you guys, but the gates open already. Can you crack the latch?” I said, referring to the door. 

There was no static response. I stared in the silence and watched the steel door in the distance bobble as the deadbolts were retracted. It began to swing open slowly. 

I still didn’t drive forward. I stayed watching it open in a trance. I’ve seen these doors open a hundred times before, but this time everything felt different. 

Was it because of my horrible day? Or the fact that there was no warm welcoming voice over the intercom? Either way the door now hung open like the lid of a casket and into it I would walk.

But there’d be people. I thought and smiled. I’d see people. 

Oh, you sweet summer child.

I parked just a few feet from the entrance and got out of the truck quickly. I had no desire to linger outside when that thing was still out there somewhere.

Protocol was that a silo man would greet me at the entrance and then the hatch would quickly close again. But when I looked past the open door there was no one on the steps. 

Something was horribly wrong, and my heart began to race again but this time it was tired, exhausted from fear. I set my right hand on my holster and turned around. The inside of the silo was still far more welcoming than spending another second outside and I quickly hopped down the steps.

At the bottom of the stairs there was a landing and another door. I turned the knob and stepped through and continued down the black steel catwalk that snaked around the concrete cylinder. The missile sat hidden on the other side.

The control room was just ahead now. There would be somebody inside. Every second of every day it was manned. The two-person team working in shifts of six hours on six off. 

I put my left hand on the doorknob, my right still on my holster. I took a breath, thinking it my last, and opened the door. 

I made eye contact with a woman sitting on the floor. She leaned against the opposite door that led down to the living quarters. I don’t remember seeing the blood or drawing my handgun, but it was already leveled at two men who stood in front of her.

They spun to me and pointed their pistols back. They began screaming at me in what sounded like Russian. 

I knew I was screaming at them too, but I can’t remember what I said. My brain was racked with everything my amygdala could give and analyzed the situation in what might’ve only been a second.

The girl on the ground was American. Her fatigues confirmed so. She stared at her feet as if in concentration. She’d been shot by these men with foreign forest green uniforms I didn’t recognize. Their pistols weren’t U.S. issue. They weren’t speaking English.

I fired while still yelling. I shot what might’ve been seven times in half as many seconds. Being only six feet from them both it was impossible to miss and they both collapsed like abandoned marionettes. 

I’ve never taken someone’s life. I’ve never fantasied about it like a lot of men that were in the military do either. However, there was no time to process what I’d done. What was more apparent than having never taken a life was that I had never fired a gun inside without ear protection. 

I was deaf. Tinnitus whine and an underwater world. Still, I stepped over the bodies and knelt to the woman. 

“Are you okay?” 

She nodded and gently touched my temple as if unsure I was real.

I noticed a bloom of blood on her stomach. She held the wound in her other hand. 

“Where’s your other silo man?”

Her breathing was labored but slowly she spoke. “In bed.”

I could hardly hear her and I thought that reading her lips could help but they didn't seem to correspond to what she said.

“I’m going to grab him quick.” The living quarters was only seconds away and I stared to stand but she grabbed my wrist. Her grip was powerful and cold as if the warmth was leaving from the hole in her. 

“Dead.”

“Oh.” 

“We have to leave.”

“You need to stay still. We can get a helicopter here from Warren in 20 minutes.” 

“No.” She closed her eyes as if pained to have to explain. “A cell.” She whispered.

“What?” My mind went to mitochondria and nuclei. I followed her gaze. She was looking at the service door in the concrete wall that led to the silo itself where the missile was housed. 

It was a beast of a door similar to the entry hatch. Meant to keep out the smoke and heat and the accelerant in takes to launch 80,000 pounds into the stratosphere. 

It was slightly ajar, and I stood and pressed it open. But there was no warhead behind it. All I saw was the pale cement wall of the other side. 

My stunned mind thought the missile had been launched but soon realized there never was one here to begin with. 

Four stories below the floor was padded with something that looked like plastic and there was a window that ringed around the entire cylinder at the bottom as if for observation. 

I turned and met the woman’s gaze. 

“It’s not a silo.” She looked at me as if I were an idiot. “[It’s a cell](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheFrontenac/hot/).”

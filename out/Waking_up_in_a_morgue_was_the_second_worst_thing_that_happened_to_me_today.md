My head was throbbing. That was the first thing that crossed my mind. The sensation of pain, ebbing and flowing like a wave all over my head. I knew what I was feeling was a migraine. I let out a slow groan as I slowly opened my eyes to see…

Nothing…

I could feel my eyes were wide open but I just saw darkness. It was at that moment a panic set in and I lurched to rise only to thud my head against something. It was then I noticed I was lying prone and whatever room I was in, it was too small for any semblance of comfort. I had never felt claustrophobic before but in that instance I began to understand fully the terror of a cramped space. 

As my mind raced to resolve the question of where I even was I soon noticed the strange material wrapped around my body. The more I came too, the more the finer details seemed to fall into place. I noticed this material had a zipper on it and I started to feel the cold of this little prison I found myself in. I realized that aside from this strange sleeping bag, I was completely naked.

I started to think of how I got here anyway, and then it hit me. I couldn’t remember my name or my face but I could recall the crash. I must have been changing lanes or something reckless because the last thing I could remember was the blaring horn of whatever hit me before my car went over the bridge.

“Oh god, they think I’m dead.”
I whispered to myself but no one heard me. I knew from the chill that I must be in the morgue. Back in high school anatomy class we had to watch how they refrigerate the bodies before embalming them. Something about stopping decomposition. I began to panic, fearing hypothermia. The thin bodybag wasn’t enough to to keep the cold at bay

It especially didn’t help that I noticed I was starting to get hungry. I thought to myself, “the only thing worse than being presumed dead and trapped in a morgue, is being presumed dead and trapped in a morgue on an empty stomach.” They say it helps to have humor in a situation like this. After that I started to look on the bright side.

I knew that they’d have to take me out eventually, either to identify me or perform an autopsy. Once someone pulls me out they’ll see me moving and my troubles would be over. Then I considered the reality of the situation. I have no idea how long that’ll be. I may not have all that much time. Another thought that occurred to me was also quite optimistic, I realized that my hunger would subside eventually. After all, starvation wouldn’t kill me as quick as the lack of oxygen.

I thought for the briefest moment, perhaps that’s not a bad way to go. I’d just pass out and die in my sleep from the carbon dioxide poisoning of my own breath. Not everyone is lucky enough to die painless like that. However, before I could think about it any further I heard a peculiar noise from inside this metal box I found myself trapped in. It was a low, deep and guttural gurgle.

I noticed that I was hungrier than I thought. I began to imagine delicacies in my head: rotisserie chicken, veal, a rich rare steak.
I decided escape was a worthwhile option to try. I started screaming, hoping some mortician was working within earshot. Eventually, my voice grew hoarse and my ears rang from the sound of my own voice.

Then my adrenaline kicked in. Fight or flight was telling me with everything I had to break free. I used my hands and began searching the plastic bag only to find no openings. I opened my mouth and bit into it and pushed my fingers through the opening I had just made. I felt brisk air rush over my fingertips but that only motivated me to rip it apart. After I had made an opening big enough for my head, I slowly peeled it off like a snake shedding its skin. Now all that was left was getting out of the locker.

I pulled my legs in and with all my might I kicked the hatch to get out. With a loud crash I knocked the short chamber door off its hinges. As the light rushed in I breathed a sigh of relief. My nightmare was over. I pushed against the inside of the locker and the tray beneath me began to slide out. 

Freedom never tasted so sweet. My eyes darted around to search the room I found myself in. It was very clean with a cubed, white tile floor. Perhaps, I was in a hospital? I checked a clock on the wall.  It was 1:21 AM. Early morning.

I looked up to see the lamps above the autopsy tables and I almost instinctively raised my hands to the light to bask in the comfort of some kind of warmth. 

That was when I noticed it.

My skin was… pale.

I was never tan but, I could see each and every one of my veins. I noticed my hand had swollen up considerably and my fingertips were blue. I brought my arm closer to smell myself. It was putrid. An unmistakable scent, the smell of something foul. The smell of something rotting.

Despite this stench, I still had quite an appetite worked up. I could feel my stomach burning. Like a fire was lit inside my torso. It was the only warmth I could still feel. Soon, my ears picked up the jingling of keys behind the door to the mortuary. The door out slowly creaked open.

A blonde woman wearing a lab coat with tired eyes stepped in. She rubbed her face for a moment before she looked up to see me.

Our eyes met. Her jaw opened and her lips began to quiver. As a faint shriek barely escaped her mouth she let out a gasp and fainted at the sight of me.

She left the door wide open. As I stepped forward to get some well needed fresh air. My stomach growled intensely.

I started to drool. My eyes searched her from head to toe as the hunger soared. I felt my lips move to bare my teeth. I mused to myself, how soft this woman’s skin was. Would it peel away easily or would I have to chew…

It took… a lot out of me to resist that temptation… It was a very strange feeling. I suppose everyone’s been curious at some point of their life what human flesh tastes like. I mean, it’s a natural thought everyone has.

Yet in that moment, I felt myself drooling at the sight of warm meat. I reached my hand down… not knowing what I would do next, but what stopped me was what i saw on my arm. An orange bracelet. It had a name on it.

“Leonard Parker”

I could feel clarity in my mind as my headache subsided. I then saw her lab-coat had a name-tag as well. 

“Claire”

I felt a wave of guilt wash over me. I reached down and took off her lab-coat.
I dressed myself up and snuck out of the building into the warm night.

I opened the door to my apartment and sat down on the couch, exhausted.

I’ve had a very rough day.

A couple years back I was living alone in a pretty calm place. There wasn’t much drama in the neighborhood and mostly everyone knew each other. 
       
One night, I turned on the TV after a nice warm shower and was searching for some interesting videos on YouTube, I came across an animated horror story video about how the boogie man stalked and lived in a house for a while before being caught. I usually don’t like horror stuff and when I do watch it I put my feet closer to me cuz I get the feeling I’m gonna get pulled from my feet. I felt like I was being watched which wasn’t very weird to me considering I was watching a horror story. I turned around and my heart dropped, not because there was someone there but because there wasn’t anyone there I had heard some leaves crunching at the window behind me so I was truly scared.

Anyways a few weeks past and I had completely forgotten about the noise, I figured it was just the wind or a cat. This time I watched another scary YouTube video but not from the same creator. It wasn’t as scary but for some reason I found myself putting my feet closer like I always do. I heard a meow from a dark gray cat who ran away followed by a similar leaf crunching sound. This time when I turned around I saw someone. Just standing there. Not moving except for his mouth he was eating something. I couldn’t really tell what it was because I immediately closed the window and called the cops. When the cops got there a few minutes later, I told them that I wanted to stay at the station for a while until they figure out who or what that was. When I went back home I figured I was just gonna pack my things and go stay with my bsf for a while, at least until I got things sorted out. She was so supportive and let me stay for as long as I needed to. 

She ended up kicking me out. The person that was watching me had apparently followed me and I had no where to stay if whoever was watching me was just going to follow me and haunt whoever I move in with. One night I decided to sit in my front lawn with a bat, to see if he would come up to me. He did. He slowly started approaching me and as I dialed 911 he started chewing. I had no clue what he was going to do next. It was terrifying, even though I had the advantage. I went inside and made sure he wasn’t going anywhere. When the police sirens were clearly audible in the distance he staring walking away. I chased after him and clubbed him on the head with my bat. He fell. The police arrived and told me that same man had kidnapped some teens at the local high school and killed them. I was relieved. But not that he had done so much to terrify others. I wanted revenge but knew that the police would take care of him and try to find any possible surviving victims. 

That was the most horrific experience of my life and I hope it never happens again.

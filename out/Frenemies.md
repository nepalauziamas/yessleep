I'd like to preface this by warning everyone that this story contains a scenario that includes gun violence. I have written this story as it was told to me by an acquaintance.

Lynn, the owner of the home in this story, was asleep in her home along with about five other people. Of those five people, a guy named Jason was a long time protective friend who was often the first one to answer the door whenever anyone showed up. So, Jason unknowingly ended up letting the danger in that morning.

Lynn's good friend Brandy was at the door, someone seemingly normal that everyone around there was used to seeing. But as Brandy made her way down the long hallway towards Lynn's bedroom, she slipped on a wig from her bag along with a pair of black vinyl gloves.

Lynn awoke just moments later to Brandy standing over her on the end of her bed. As the Sleepy Haze began to clear from her mind, she noticed Brandy's wig and black gloves and instantly shot up in her bed, allowing the cold air from the morning to bite at her skin. It was then that Brandy reached back into her waistband and pulled out a handgun!

Lynn watched, almost in slow motion as Brandy pulled back the slide on the gun and loaded a bullet into its chamber, before pointing the gun at her. Without hesitation, Lynn lunged up from beneath the benign safety of her covers and went for Brandy while screaming "gun!"

That got the rest of her guests awake and at full attention. As everyone rushed into Lynn's bedroom and noticed the gun in Brandy's hand as her and Lynn fought, a guy named Chris jumped into action first. Coming up behind Brandy, he wrapped his arm around her neck, trying to subdue her quickly. Meanwhile, a girl named Chrissy jumped in on the fight. As the three of them wrestled around and fought, Lynn's niece Nisa ran in and instantly jumped in on her behalf. At about that point, the gun got turned onto Lynn's beloved dog rocky, which absolutely infuriated her. Thus, the fight became even more brutal, with Lynn and the lead.

Finally, Lynn got control of the gun after it was knocked from Brandy's fighting and flailing hands. After they had successfully subdued brandy, they pretty much rolled her up in an area rug and pushed her out the bedroom window. From there, Brandy had a long, arduous roll down a very Steep and very long hill covered In poison oak, sharp manzanita and brush along with poking and stabbing scrub oak branches.

That wasn't the end of their near fatal plight though, at least not yet. Bullets begin to tear through the home's walls. One after another quite quickly, ammo fired from an AR-15 semi-automatic assault rifle. That weapon was being operated  by Brandy's boyfriend, from the front driveway. Bullets tore through the safety of the walls of the home in a seemingly straight line, splintering cabinet doors, punching a line of holes down the hallway walls and eventually grazing the head of Jason the doorman. The bullets continued pelting in, desecrating a small bathroom before finally stopping and allowing an eerie silence to befall on all.

One week later, Lynn made a terrifying discovery and shouted for all of her friends to come into her bedroom. Chris, Chrissy, Nisa, Jason and Lynn's dog Rocky went running into her room. Naturally, they were all afraid of a repeat of the terrifying events of the week before. They were incredibly lucky to have survived the terrible ordeal pretty much unscathed. Curious, they all crowded in to see what Lynn was pointing at on her mattress, on the very side in which she slept. As they leaned into inspect closer, they saw a small hole in the mattress. It was a bullet hole and they were able to extract its culprit with a pair of long tweezers. That bullet, was somehow fired from Brandy's pistol, unbeknownst to lynn. The bullet punched into the mattress right where Lynn peacefully slept, night after night.

Much to Lynn's relief, Brandy was convicted and sentenced to around 16 years, I believe. Make of the story what you will, but what I took from it, was that you never, ever really know anybody. And you may never know what they're capable of either.

Boxer whined and stirred me from a shallow sleep. He was off the bed and sniffing at the small gap at the base of the door. A dull light came in through the single window on the eastern wall of the cabin. The sun was up, but the clouds were thick and dark in the sky. Light snow made a gentle patter against the glass window. The trees swayed in the wind. Ominous clouds suggested it would get worse.

I unlocked the door and inched it open. Boxer thrust his snout into the growing gap and pushed until it was wide enough for him to pass. He scurried out and disappeared around the corner. Moments later he barked and I ran to the rear of the cabin, rifle raised.

“Who’s there?” I yelled.

Boxer was still barking at the trees. I searched for signs of movement and heard some rustling to my left. I swung the barrel of my rifle and there was George Visser, arms raised.

“Don’t shoot,” George said.

“What are you doing out there?”

“We’re looking for my boy.” Mark Potter stepped out from behind a tree, a rifle of his own raised and pointed in my direction.

“Lower your gun,” I said.

“Not until you lower yours,” Potter said.

I pointed the barrel down and to the right. “Your boy isn’t here.”

Potter moved forward, rifle still pointed at me. “Let me see inside your cabin.”

“You’ll need to get through Boxer first. He won’t let anything in but me.”

Boxer lowered his head and growled.

“Call off your dog.”

“The police were here yesterday,” I said. “Go ask Chief Fingleton.”

“I’m asking you. Let me look in the cabin.”

Potter was at the edge of the clearing now. Short, sharp barks punctuated Boxer’s growling. I put my hand on him and told him to heel. His body vibrated as he continued his deep, low growl.

“Come here and look in the window. I’ve only got one room. But put down the gun.” I slung my rifle over my shoulder and took one step to the left. Potter lowered his shoulders and dropped the barrel of his rifle, but kept his finger by the trigger.

“Keep your dog off me.”

“I told him no. It’s up to him if he listens.”

Potter crept to the window, stealing glances at Boxer every other step, and peered inside. The cabin was small and there wasn’t much to see. A bed pushed against the western wall, shelves holding pots and pans and rice and lamps, hunting and fishing gear stacked in a corner by the door.

“Your boy isn’t here,” I said.

“What have you done with him?” Potter raised his rifle and pointed it at me.

“If you’re going to shoot me, get on with it. Otherwise get on your way.”

“You know the kids in town have a running bet. Anyone who comes up here and gets through the trees and into this clearing wins a hundred bucks.”

“Is that so?”

“The people in town tell stories about you. Mr Frontiersman. Mr Wildman. Long beard and long hair and the stink of a man who hasn’t washed in a month. Living up here all alone isn’t normal.”

“I like it better than sharing a town with the likes of you.”

“Maybe the loneliness and the silence and the trees got to you. Maybe some kids came up here to your cabin and things got out of hand.” Potter dropped his rifle and ran his hand over the char marks on the cabin walls. “What the hell happened here?”

“Potter, look!”

The cry came from the edge of the trees, from George Visser, who had not moved since I’d first seen him. He pointed up above the trees, eyes wide and mouth open.

I followed the raised arm and hovering above the trees was a long black cord, like a giant snake. It was stationary, unmoved by the wind. Boxer started barking once more and I quieted him. The black snake moved now, coming toward us, maintaining its height above the tree line. It stopped directly above George. At the tip of the snake a series of smaller tentacles fanned out like fingers. The tentacles pulsed and hissed and ejected black smoke.

The snake dropped and the tentacles at the tip wrapped around the head of George. For a moment George was still, his head raised slightly like he was trying to smell something on the wind. His chest expanded and contracted and he shook. Then he turned and marched in a line made by the black snake as if it were a fishing line and he was being reeled in.

“What’s happening George?” Potter said.

George said nothing in response. Potter ran to his friend and shot out an arm and grabbed at George’s jacket, swinging him round. George swatted the hand away and landed a gloved fist on Potter’s temple, dropping him to the ground. Potter winced and rubbed his head. He looked to me with wide eyes and then back to his friend who walked to the trees.

Potter stumbled to his feet and rushed at George, kicking up snow as he went. Potter overtook his friend and blocked his path. Potter stood as a statue between George and the trees and held up a hand.

“Stop,” Potter said.

George paused and took the rifle slung over his shoulder and shot Potter through his head. The crack from the gun echoed off the trees and somewhere a bird cried and took flight. Mark Potter crumpled to the ground and lay lifeless. Blood poured from his forehead onto the snow. George lowered his rifle and stepped over the body and walked into the woods, led by the black snake which had not loosened its grip.

Boxer jumped forward, an apprehensive first couple of steps toward the body of Potter before stopping and turning back to me. I woke from my stupor and went into the trees after George, rifle raised. It was not a black snake, it was part of the creature. The same thing that had taken the boy. It must be a limb or a tail, but whatever it was I knew the creature would be at the end of it and when Potter got there, it would take him.

I followed George’s tracks in the snow. They led deep into the forest. Ahead I saw a rifle lying in the snow. George had discarded it and there I stopped. I could not see anything but the trees and I could not hear anything but the wind. Boxer sniffed at my feet but refused to go on. I smelled something on the air. Something familiar that I could not put a finger on.

I crept forward, eyes darting between the tracks in the snow and the trees where the creature might be hiding. And then I saw him through the trees. George stood before the beast.

The creature had the shape of a wolf. Everything was a monotone black, except two red orbs for eyes. It was taller than a wolf should be, closer to that of a horse. The creature stood on thick legs ending in large flat paws with claws extending out like human fingers. A long tail sprung from a thick hind quarter and ended in the tentacles wrapped around George’s head.

I aimed my rifle at the creature. Like a lion pouncing on a gazelle it leapt at George, its paws leaving the ground and stretching out and embracing him. The creature moved fast for a beast its size. When it embraced George it swallowed him in darkness and he was gone. The creature turned and retreated into the forest.

I was breathless. It didn’t look real, but imaginary things don’t take people away. A demon might drag you away in your sleep, but then you wake in your bed. I stood helpless, rifle raised, having not fired a shot. I stared at the empty forest where George had been only moments before.

I crept to where the creature had been. Char marks on the trees. A patch of melted snow where it had stood. Tracks of melted snow led into the forest. The creature was gone and so was George. Like the boy Steven, the creature had taken him.

There was shouting off to my right and I heard the rushed footsteps of people running through the woods. I turned with my rifle and heard the voice of Chief Fingleton.

“Drop your weapon,” he said.

I lowered my rifle to the ground and raised my hands in the air. Fingleton closed in on me. “Was that you shooting?”

“Did you see it?” I said.

“Did I see what?”

“George is gone. It went that way”

Fingleton, now beside me, kicked my rifle away and put his body between me and my weapon. “What have you done with him?”

A second set of footsteps came bounding down from behind me. It was the deputy, Elliot. “Mark Potter has been shot. He’s dead.”

“Get down on your knees, hands above your head,” Fingleton shouted. I complied and then my face was in the snow and there were knees on my back and my hands were in cuffs.

“You need to go after it,” I said. “It took George.”

Fingleton was not in the mood to listen. He hauled me up and took me back to town.

I explained what had happened at the station, but it wasn’t much use. Fingleton wasn’t buying it. It didn’t help that George’s rifle make and model matched my own. It would take some time to determine which gun fired the bullet that destroyed Mark Potter’s brain. And even when it did come it wouldn’t put the matter to bed. They could say I overpowered George and used it against Potter. For what reason would George have shot his friend?

Chief Fingleton carried a look of satisfaction when he dismissed my version of events. When he woke that morning he had a mystery he could not solve. A missing boy and a fanciful story from a recluse and a couple of teenagers who had been drinking. I saw a weight lifted as he questioned my story and substituted it with his own version of events. Potter and Visser had come up to my cabin and there had been an argument. It was no secret there was bad blood between George and I. I had overpowered George and shot Potter. Then I had done god knows what to George. It was logical and explained everything and made it almost certain I had also disposed of Potter’s boy Steven the day before.

Fingleton and Elliott demanded I tell them what I had done with George, but I could only tell them the creature took him. The dark wolf-like animal hunting in the forest. I told them to go look at my cabin and the trees where they’d arrested me and they would see the charring. I told them to follow the tracks in the snow while they still could. It made no difference. They kept at me for a couple of hours trying to get a confession but they gave up and took me to the holding cell.

The holding cell is at the back of the station. Three concrete walls and steel bars on the fourth. There is a toilet and a sink and a single bed in the corner and a single small window above the bed. The holding cell was usually for drunks who hadn’t known when to say when and had ended up in a fist fight over some trifle. Elliott thrust me into the cell and closed the steel gate behind me. A set of keys jangled and the lock engaged.

I turned to Elliott. He smiled, satisfied with his day of police work. There were still two missing bodies out there somewhere, but they would be found or I would crack and tell them where they were.

“What did you do with Boxer?” I asked.

“He wouldn’t come. Last I saw he was sulking around that cabin of yours. We got no intention of going to get him either. If he doesn’t want to come, it’s on him.”

“Let me ask you something,” I said.

“What?” Elliott said.

“Lee Rutkowski, the hunter who went missing.”

“What about him?”

“You never found his body, but did you find any charred trees while you were looking?”

The smile left Elliott’s face. He clenched his teeth. “We found whatever you left for us to find.” Elliott clipped the keys to his belt and left.

The cell was cold and outside it was getting dark. I laid down on the bed and kicked off my boots. I hoped sleep would come. Tonight I was in the safest place in Canary Hill. I only wished Boxer was with me. I thought of him out there in the dark and hoped he was safe.

\-----------

Two things happened that resulted in my release from prison. The first was the analysis of the bullet retrieved from Mark Potter’s brain. Now the police knew it had come from George’s rifle. The second was the creature taking another person and this time there were witnesses to the event.

Diana Fawns worked at the supermarket in town and lived with her husband Lewis in a small house fronting onto the lake at the edge of town. As Lewis told it he found himself outside in the dead of the night, torch in mouth and desperately trying to get the pilot light on their heating system to ignite. Diana had awoken in a bedroom that was an ice box. She nudged her husband who, despite the cold, was dead asleep.

While Lewis worked, Diana provided moral support on the porch, rugged up against the cold. Lewis’s fingers numbed as he tried and failed to get a spark from the lighter. He rubbed the end of the lighter against the inside of his jacket and tried again and this time produced a flame and he used it to get the pilot light going. He turned the temperature dial and the heating system roared back to life.

“Success.”

Diana went back inside. Lewis closed the cover on the heater and switched off the torch and trotted to the front door. He blew warm air into his hands and rubbed them together. He climbed the steps to the porch and kicked his boots against the railing and shook off the snow. At the door he stopped. There was a strange black cord about the diameter of his arm in the top corner of the doorway. The cord came from the darkness and he followed it backward to find its source, but the night was dark and it disappeared beyond the reach of the porch light.

Lewis entered the house. The cord snaked its way around to the left and disappeared into the kitchen, oscillating like a garden hose full of water as it went. Lewis reached out a hand to touch it when he heard his wife yell out. He went to the kitchen and found his wife standing by the sink with black tentacles wrapped around her head. He described it as if there were a black beehive covering her head.

“What the hell?” Lewis said.

Lewis rushed to Diana and put his hands on her shoulders. He spoke to her but she did not respond. She did not seem to be in pain and she did not seem scared. He could not make out her expression but her body was calm. Then she spoke.

“It wants me to come.”

“What does?”

“I have to go now.”

Diana turned and Lewis loosened his grip. Diana walked toward the door of the kitchen. Lewis put himself in the doorway and blocked his wife from exiting. Diana, denied access to the door by her husband, turned and took the biggest knife from the rack on the bench next to the stovetop. She turned back to her husband and buried the knife into his thigh. Lewis fell to the floor screaming. Lewis pulled the knife and blood came, first in drips and then with a rush. He limped to the bathroom and took a towel and tied it around the wound as tight as he could.

In the house next door, which was a way up the hill, the screaming woke a twenty year old university student named Marek. Marek was lodging in Canary Hill as part of a study taking measurements of the permafrost for a research project. He donned his jacket and boots and ran down the hill to the house. He knew Lewis and Diana well, they had dined together on many occasions. This made for a welcome change for Marek who could not identify a single neighbour by name where he lived in the city.

Marek came in through the open door and followed the trail of blood to the bathroom where Lewis clutched at a blood soaked towel on his leg. Lewis asked after his wife, but Marek had not seen her. Marek lifted Lewis to his feet and helped him to his car. Marek got behind the wheel.

“Where are you taking me?” Lewis said.

“You have to get to a hospital.”

“No, we have to find Diana. She walked out into the night.”

Marek and Lewis drove the streets of Canary Hill looking for Diana. They found no one. Then Lewis remembered the disappearances in the forest and instructed Marek to take the road in that direction. They skirted the edge of the frozen lake and as the trees came into view they spotted Diana in the light of the headlights. Diana Fawns, in her white nightgown, no shoes and no jacket, in the dark and cold, and heading for the woods.

The car came to a stop as Diana made it to the tree line. The two men exited the vehicle and called out to her. The headlights penetrated into the woods a way and the two men followed Diana and they saw it. There was a creature out there, but it reflected no light and was a dull black mass. They could not see what it was and guessed it might be a bear, but had no explanation for why the headlights did not illuminate it.

Diana stopped before the creature and raised her head, the black tentacles still wrapped around her head and the cord leading from the tentacles into the forest and to the creature. Lewis limped toward his wife, calling at her to come back to him. In a flash the creature pounced and Diana Fawns disappeared. There was a rustle in the trees and in a moment the creature was gone. Lewis had seen bears before and this was no bear. He could not say what it was.

Elliott came to release me from the cell. He was pale and bore the face of a defeated man. The night before he had likely slept comfortably, safe in a world where everything made sense and problems had known solutions. And now he and Chief Fingleton had a problem they could not explain. An unknown creature was on the loose and killing the residents of their town. There was no procedure for this.

“The Chief wants to see you before you go,” Elliott said.

Chief Fingleton was in no better mood than Elliott. He waved me into his office as he put down the telephone at his desk. I sat and Fingleton tilted his upper body forward and leant on his elbows and rested his mouth on his closed fists. He stared at the empty desk between us. It took a few moments before he raised his eyes to mine.

“I can’t let you go back up there,” he said.

“To my cabin? You can’t do that.”

“I can and am. We issued the permit for your home up there and we are rescinding it temporarily. Those woods are now off limits to all civilians.”

“Someone else got taken?”

“Last night. Diana Fawns.”

He ran me through the details.

“Where am I going to go? And Boxer?”

“We found Boxer at the front door of the station this morning. We tied him up outside. I’ve made arrangements at the Canary Motel, you’ll have a room there, no charge. Go down and talk to Marian at the desk, she’s expecting you.”

“You can’t do this.”

“I just did. You go anywhere near the forest and I’ll arrest you. I’ve got bigger problems so I’m asking you for your cooperation.” Fingleton placed his palms on the desk. “I apologize for holding you.”

“When can I go back up there?”

“After we’ve dealt with it.”

“What are you going to do?”

Fingleton paused. “There’s weather coming in. When it clears, backup is coming up from the south and we’ll go up there and take care of it.”

“You don’t even know what it is.”

“This is my problem to solve. Take Boxer to the Motel and stay there. I’ve called a town meeting tonight at the hall, come along if you want. There are a lot of people with a lot of questions.”

Fingleton swivelled in his chair and sighed and stared at the wall of his office. He waved me away with his hand and I left him with his thoughts.

Boxer was curled up outside the front door and he raised his head and nuzzled his snout against my leg. He was tired. We walked together down the street, empty of people and cars. At the crossroad a cold wind hit me. The street signs swayed and dark clouds stretched across the sky. Fingleton was right, there was weather coming.

Marian gave me two keys, one for my room and one for a small laundry room at the end where Boxer was to lodge. The no pets in rooms policy had no exceptions. Marian gave me a bowl and a blanket and I spread the blanket beside the bank of washers and dryers and sat with Boxer. The room was cold and the glass door rattled in the wind. It started to snow.

The weather brought the dark early. I dozed and woke with a start at the sound of a tree branch breaking and falling to the ground. I checked the time by the clock on the wall, its face illuminated by the lights from the electronic coin slots on the machines. I left Boxer sleeping and went out into the snow.

The meeting was already underway when I entered the hall. Around thirty of the residents of the town were in fold up chairs facing the front. Fingleton stood behind a podium flanked by Elliott. A few heads turned to me when I entered and lingered before turning back to Fingleton. I stood in the back rather than take a chair.

May McKenna, who owned and ran a small café in town called the Blue and White, stood among the seated townspeople. She spoke into a microphone. ”Chief, can you tell us what is going on? Everyone I talk to has a different story of what is happening out there in the forest.”

“It seems,” Fingleton answered, “there is some animal out in the forest. That is why there is a temporary ban on access. No one is to enter the forest until further notice.”

“Are we safe in the town?”

“We don’t yet have any report of this animal being seen outside the forest.”

“Then how did it get Diana Fawns? I heard she was at home when it came.”

“The Fawns house is adjacent to the forest.”

“It isn’t in the forest. How far has it come?”

“We don’t know.”

“What happens if it gets you? Diana put a knife in Lewis’s leg and then she walked out to the forest in the freezing cold without her coat in the middle of the night.”

“We also have reason to believe the animal breathed a form of poison or toxin that has an effect on the victim’s behaviour.”

“So we’re not safe in our homes and we’re not safe around anyone who comes into contact with this thing?”

“Our advice is to stay indoors, keep your windows and your doors shut and sealed as best you can.”

“How many of these things are out there?”

“Only one has been seen at any one time.”

“How many are there?”

“We don’t know.”

“What do you know?”

“There is something out there.” A small voice from the corner of the room. All heads turned. It was Janine Rutkowski, whose husband had gone out hunting and never came home. “You knew there was something out there when Lee never came home. And you did nothing.”

“What are you going to do?” May McKenna shouted into the microphone.

Fingleton paused. “We have requested assistance from down south. Unfortunately the weather down there is worse than it is here. We’ve been told the Stuart Bridge is impassable on account of fallen trees and high water levels. They need to wait until the weather clears.”

“When is that going to be?” May spoke above the murmuring from the residents.

“Monday at the earliest, but maybe a week.”

“If you’d raised the alarm as soon as it took the kid we’d have the cavalry up here right now.”

“What’s done cannot be changed.”

“I’m leaving.” May put the microphone back into the stand. “I’m not waiting.”

Fingleton held up his hands. “Our information is that the roads are impassable in this weather. And the storm is coming, it will get worse before it gets better. If you drive south now you are likely to get stuck and stranded.”

The murmur in the audience rose to shouting and finger pointing. Fingleton lowered his eyes to the floor and held up his hands.

May had taken several steps away from the microphone and towards the door. She turned back. “Your job is to protect us. What are you doing now? We can’t go anywhere and so we’re sitting ducks and you’re going to sit behind your desk and wait for us to get taken? How are we supposed to be ok with that?”

Fingleton pushed back from the podium and stared at his feet. He closed his eyes and shook his head. After what felt like an hour he came back to the microphone. “At first light tomorrow Deputy Elliott and I are going into the forest to find this thing. Find it and kill it.”

Elliott snapped his head to Chief Fingleton. This was not the plan. They were supposed to wait for backup. He looked like he would be sick.

“And if it comes tonight?”

“Call the station immediately.”

“What if you can’t find it? Or what if you can and it does to you what it did to the others?”

There was a pause. “I’m coming with you.” It was the voice of a girl. Talia stood in the front corner of the room. Her head barely rose above those seated around her. The wild hair and wide eyes from the night on the mountain was now a braided ponytail and a resolute stare.

“Talia, no,” Fingleton said.

“Why not? I’ve seen this thing too. And my father is out there somewhere. It’s my fight as much as it is yours.”

“We are not asking anyone else to help.”

“I don’t need you to ask. I’m volunteering.”

“We cannot take you with us. This is police business, let us do our jobs.”

“You’re wrong. It’s all our business.”

Fingleton sighed. “This creature is a danger to the town. But if we let everyone loose in the forest to find this thing, we cannot do our job, which is to protect you. Please, we ask you all to go directly to your homes and stay there. Do not leave for any reason until directed otherwise. And if anything happens, call the station.”

A couple at the back got up and left and others soon followed. May McKenna put the microphone back in the stand. There were no other options. If weather was coming it would be dangerous on the unsealed roads south, or for anyone coming north. And the forest was no place to be in a storm. Home and behind a locked door was the safest place to be.

Mark Potter’s wife dragged Talia out by the arm and I guessed she was staying with her.

The room emptied aside from Chief Fingleton and Elliott. I approached Fingleton.

“I’ll go with you, me and Boxer,” I said. “I know those woods better than anyone.”

Fingleton cleared his throat. “We don’t need you Walker. This is police business.”

“Like hell it is. The girl is right, we’re all stuck up here without anyone to help us. If I let you two go out there in this weather you’ll get lost or worse before you ever lay eyes on this thing. You need me. And Boxer can smell it, you need him too.”

“He might be able to help,” Elliott said.

Fingleton rubbed at his face with his hands. “My duty is to protect, not to put in harm’s way.”

“I know the risks. I’ve seen what it does. Whatever happens your conscience is clear. Mine won’t be if you go out there and don’t come back or you do come back but you don’t find this thing.”

Fingleton looked to the ceiling. It was as if he was searching for a solution written above. He sighed. “Alright, you can come. First light at the station. But you come under my watch and play by my rules.”

Fingleton strode to the exit and Elliott followed. I buttoned up my jacket and went back to the laundry room at the motel and lay by Boxer. We huddled on the floor wrapped in blankets. Outside the weather worsened. I didn’t sleep.

Light came, filtered grey by the clouds. Snowfall lingered into the day and the postcard view of the lake and mountain from the motel was nothing more than a white haze.

At the station a red truck pulled up and Fingleton exited. His wife was behind the wheel, ashen faced, with their two young children in the back, silent and still. Fingleton waved as the car indicated and turned a wide circle and went back the way it came. Fingleton tapped at the glass door of the station and out came Elliott.

“No one called last night,” Elliott said.

“Good,” Fingleton said.

We drove to the edge of town where the police had put up a barricade to stop anyone taking the road around the lake to the forest. The barricade had blown over in the wind and we put it back.

“We’ll walk from here,” Fingleton said.

We clambered down the slope and walked out onto the lake and towards the woods.

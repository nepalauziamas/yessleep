Snow blew in heavy on the strengthening wind. Out on the lake everything was white. We could no longer see the town behind us nor the forest and mountain before us. Fingleton, Elliott, Boxer and I walked on, leaning into the wind to steady ourselves.

I smelled the trees before I saw them, the scent thin through the snow. “We’re almost at the tree line,” I said, shouting over the sound of the wind.

The green of the trees pierced the blanket of white and we stepped off the lake and onto land. The trees were a partial shelter against the wind and snow and we crouched together against the cold. We wiped the snow from our faces and our clothes.

“Should we go back and wait for the weather to clear?” Elliott said.

“We’re not going back,” Fingleton said. “I’ve been out in worse than this.”

“When?”

“Where should we look for this thing?” Fingleton said, turning to me.

“Both times I’ve seen it,” I said, “it was in the trees not far from my cabin. I never saw where it went after it took them. But the second time, as I followed the trail through the woods, I smelled something. Boxer did too. It was something familiar. The penny didn’t drop at the time, but now I know. It smelled like the inside of the coal mine.” I pointed up in the direction of the mine, part-way up the mountain. “And if I were looking for a place to wait this storm out, that’s where I’d be.”

“Then that’s where we look,” Fingleton said.

We dusted the remaining snow from our shoulders and took our rifles in our hands and started out into the forest. We had not gone far when I turned at a rustling behind me. A flash of yellow rushed up from behind and I raised my rifle.

“Who is there?” I shouted.

The yellow form slowed and threaded through the trees. It was Talia. She raised her hands. I lowered my barrel. She had come. She said she would but I had taken it for bravado. But she had meant it.

“What are you doing?” I said.

“I want to come,” Talia said.

“Go home girl.” Fingleton pushed past me and stood over Talia.

“I came to help,” Talia said.

“Go back to town, it’s dangerous out here with the weather and this creature running around.”

“Unlike you, I’ve seen the creature and what it does,” she said. “It sends its feelers out and blows smoke in your mouth and infects you. That’s why I brought this.” Talia held up a firefighters mask. “I joined as a volunteer last year. It can protect us. Only the suit is small, they had to get it custom made for me. I’m the only one who will fit.”

The yellow Talia wore now made sense. What I first took as something she wore against the wet snow was in fact a firefighters uniform. I couldn’t fault her thinking, the black smoke from the creature did exactly as she said and the smoke mask might just work against it.

Fingleton put his hands on Talia’s shoulders. “Go home Talia. What would your father think of me if I let you walk into these woods with us?”

“He would rather I was out here with you trying to help, than back in town waiting for this thing to come and get me and everyone else.”

“I think that is what you prefer and not what he would have,” Fingleton said.

Talia stood her ground. She stared up at Fingleton, stony faced and determined. I thought it would take Chief Fingleton dragging her back to town to stop her. He might have done it too, but Elliott heard something coming from the woods and snapped his neck around.

“What was that?”

I listened. It came again. It was Boxer. While we had been arguing he had left us and gone off into the forest. Boxer barked. With the wind I couldn’t tell how far way he was.

“Bring her, we don’t have time for debate right now,” I said. “Keep close to me.”

I sprinted towards the sound. It is a tricky business pinpointing sound in a forest, the trees have a tendency to reflect noise, and the wind made it that much worse. Another bark. I changed direction and leaped over a fallen tree and there was Boxer, the black streak on his back a beacon against the snow. Boxer was quiet now and trotting through the trees, head raised. He ran like this when he found a scent on the wind. I called to him, but he did not stop. The wind blew in my face and extinguished the sound as soon as it left my lips.

I ran in parallel with Boxer. My boots crunched in the snow. Boxer never turned his head. Something had his attention, but I could not see anything. I jumped behind him and called for him to stop. Boxer held up and turned.

“Why did you run off?” I said.

I looked for the others, but I could not see them. Around me was only trees and snow. No Chief, or Elliott, or Talia in her yellow firefighter’s suit. “I found Boxer. Come to my voice,” I yelled.

Boxer turned his nose to the sky. He turned from me and trotted up the hill and deeper into the forest, turning back to see if I was following.

“Heel Boxer,” I said, jogging after him.

Boxer growled and continued undeterred.

We weaved our way up the hill. The snow thinned on the ground beneath the canopy of the forest, but it was still thick enough for Boxer’s paws to disappear as he moved. His pace quickened. He had the scent now and I too could smell something filtering through the trees on the wind.

Boxer stopped. He raised his head to the sky and barked. High above, just below the tree tops, the black tail of the creature swayed like a cobra waiting to strike. At the tip of the tail the tentacles writhed and blew out wisps of black smoke.

I stepped ahead of Boxer and raised my rifle, peering through the gaps between the trees and looking for the creature. I could not see it. I opened my mouth to call out and notify the others of my whereabouts but immediately closed it again. I did not know if the creature would hear me instead.

Behind me Boxer growled. I shot a glance at him and my heart sank. The black tentacles at the tip of the creature’s tail had wrapped themselves around his head. The white fur on his cheeks was barely visible. He growled once more. I took a step toward him and he lowered his head. In the dull grey light I saw a flash of white from between the tentacles around Boxer’s head. He had bared his teeth at me.

Boxer leapt at me and I threw out my hands and grabbed at the underside of his torso. I fell back into the snow from surprise as much as anything. Boxer’s chest vibrated as he growled again and I heard a short snarl as he opened his jaws and went for my neck. One tooth caught me on the jaw and I felt the skin rip and warm blood spilled down my neck. He meant to kill me.

I threw Boxer off and turned to my side and grabbed for my rifle which I had dropped in the snow. It was out of arms reach. Boxer leapt once more and I had time only to cover my head and then came the crack of a gunshot. It echoed off the trees. Then another shot and another. Boxer went limp.

I raised my head. “Are you ok?” It was Fingleton. He burst through the trees and stood over me with his gun pointed ahead into the forest. I rolled my torso and pushed Boxer off my stomach. The body made a thud in the snow. Boxer lay stiff and unmoving. The tentacles of the creature were gone from his head.

I thrust out a hand but withdrew it when I saw black smoke exiting Boxer’s nostrils. The smoke had infected him and turned him against me.

“Breathe it out,” I said.

Above, the black tail of the creature retreated. I followed the direction of Fingleton’s rifle and there it was. It must have stalked closer after it had taken hold of Boxer. Elliott and Talia came running out.

“I think I landed a couple of blows and it’s running. Come on, we have to follow it,” Fingleton said. He bent down and grabbed my arm and lifted me from the snow. I stumbled and went back and stood over Boxer. He blinked and shook his head and rolled himself to his feet. He coughed and ejected a puff of black smoke and then no more came. I held out my hand and he buried his snout in it. I had Boxer back.

I grabbed my rifle from the snow. Fingleton had run ahead with Elliott and Talia in tow. We ran after them and soon caught them. They were following the creature and the long black tail it trailed behind, their heads raised to the sky.

“Be careful,” I shouted after them, “that thing can’t be far away.” We were running north and uphill.

The trees thinned out and the creature was nowhere to be seen. Soon we would be out of the thickest part of the woods and the creature would be exposed, and so would we. I tried to get my bearings and I found a landmark. Through the trees the brick smokestack came into view. We were almost at the mine.

We came across the old road cut through the forest. The creature was still up ahead and heading north, but outpacing us. We followed it until we were out of the trees and onto the great flat pad of compacted gravel created for the mine. The metal structures that one serviced the mine stood dormant like ancient statues. The perimeter chain link fence rocked in the wind. The road led to a double wide gate swinging wildly and periodically smashing against the fence. Somewhere beneath the snow there must be a failed padlock, broken by the creature or some kids who had come up to the mine to mess around.

The creature had disappeared. Ahead was the mouth of the old mine tunnel. At the entrance to the tunnel there was another gate, or at least there used to be. The steel gate had been ripped from its hinges and lay mangled and bent in the snow. The black void of the mine tunnel was now exposed. A trail cut into the snow like an irrigation ditch leading directly to the mine.

“Keep your rifles pointed at the entrance,” I said.

There was a small building to the right of the mine entrance. It housed electrical switchboards and a backup generator that would kick in if there was ever a power outage. The door was locked. I kicked it until it loosened from its hinges and with a final effort ripped it free. The generator was still there, mounted to the concrete floor. Up until five years ago the government had been running tours in the mine, but it failed to excite the same interest as sled dog rides up to the lake for ice fishing and so they stopped. I hoped the generator had some fuel in the tank and still worked. I pushed at the ignition and the machine came to life.

Back outside Elliott and Fingleton had their guns pointed at the entrance. Talia stood behind them in her yellow suit. “I think the lights came on,” Elliott said. The string of lights on the roof of the tunnel had indeed come on.

“Don’t get too close,” Fingleton said.

“I won’t go far,” I said.

At the entrance I could see down the tunnel until the bend about a hundred yards ahead. Light from the bulbs overhead spilled onto the walls and reflected off the dark steel rails and timber slats on the floor for the rail carts that once carried miners and coal. There was no sign of the creature.

A warm breeze, like an exhaled breath, hit my face. I took off my gloves and held up my hands. The tunnel was warm. Not just warm compared to the blizzard outside, but warm like there was a heater blowing hot air down the tunnel. There was something hot in there.

“It’s in there,” I said.

“Can you see it?” Elliott said.

“No.”

“Then how do you know it’s in there?” Fingleton said.

“I can feel it. The tunnel is hot. The creature is hot. The creature is in the tunnel.”

“What do we do now?” Elliott said.

“We go inside,” Fingleton said.

\-------

I didn’t like the plan and neither did Fingleton. The only one who was comfortable was Elliott, who seemed satisfied with his position at the rear of the party. Talia had proposed it.

“The creature,” she said, “always sends the tail out first, it never comes by itself. If I go in first I will have my mask on and I will be safe. Anyone else might get infected. Once we know where the tail is, we know where the creature is. The rest of you can shoot it.”

There was some logic to it, but it didn’t feel right. Fingleton paced about for a few minutes, going over it in his head. If this went sour he’d be the one they’d blame. Three grown men and a husky allow a teenage girl to lead them into danger, only for the girl to succumb as the rest watched on. It might be the best shot at finding and killing the monster, if it was even possible to kill it, but he would not allow it.

“No,” Fingleton said finally. “The dog and Walker are up front and I am right behind them. The dog can smell it.”

“His name is Boxer,” I said.

“Boxer can smell it. He’s the one who will lead us to it. Talia and Elliott will stay near the tunnel entrance. You can go inside out of the wind, but not beyond the bend in the tunnel ahead. If it gets past us, use your weapons. If you get into trouble get out of its way.”

And that was it. Fingleton overruled Talia. Boxer and I lead Fingleton into the mine.

The tunnel walls were damp, the heat mixing with the cold from outside forming trickles of condensation. I had come down this tunnel for years, riding open carriages deep into the mountain to extract coal from the seam and riding back out with blackened hands and lungs and weary from the effort.

It was different now. The mine was lifeless without the miners and the constant chatter and the grind of the metal wheels against the rails. The smell though, was the same. I hadn’t smelled it in years but the odour lit up the section of my brain where memory is stored. The creature shared the smell.

It was quiet and still inside the tunnel, the constant whistling of the wind no longer in our ears. And it was warm. The heat combined with the closeness of the walls on all sides created a claustrophobia I had never felt when I worked the mine.

Boxer reached the bend in the tunnel. “Hold him up,” Fingleton said, “I don’t want to lose him in the tunnel.”

“He won’t go far without me.”

“He didn’t wait out in the forest.”

He had me there. “Boxer hold up.”

Boxer stopped at the bend and we bunched closer together. I clicked my tongue at Boxer and he moved on. Ahead the tunnel forked into two and Boxer stopped.

“Which way do we go?” Fingleton said.

Boxer sniffed at the ground and at each tunnel and chose the tunnel to the right. We followed and it was getting so warm I unbuttoned my coat. Boxer turned and faced us. He sniffed the air and moved on.

“It’s getting warmer,” I said.

We crept deeper into the mine. The lights ended up ahead at a three way fork in the tunnel. Boxer reached the fork and stepped out of the light and into the darkness.

“Boxer,” I whispered.

Fingleton and I skipped down to the fork. Boxer was ahead and sniffing at the floor.

“Which way do we go?” Fingleton said.

“Boxer,” I whispered, but I could not see him.

Fingleton pulled a small flashlight from his belt and searched each of the three shafts. The beam of light was weak and did not penetrate the tunnels far before the darkness swallowed up the light. I wished for my old helmet with the light, hung up on the wall of the cabin. I took off my glove and held my hand out to each of the shafts. The middle shaft felt the warmest.

“This one,” I said. Fingleton trained his torch into the middle shaft and we moved forward, feeling at the rails on the floor with our feet. The heat softened and a coolness came off the walls.

“This might not be the way,” I said.

Fingleton’s torch illuminated a dead end. We could go no further.

“Where is Boxer?” Fingleton said.

We turned at a tapping sound. Fingleton shone his torch and caught the glow of Boxer’s eyes. He returned to my feet and pointed his nose back from where he had come.

“Stay where I can see you this time,” I said.

We followed Boxer back to the three way fork and Boxer led us to the shaft on the right. We felt our way down the tunnel and rounded another bend and ahead something glowed. On the left side of the shaft an enormous crater opened like someone had set off a bomb. The glow illuminated the tracks which bent into the shape of an ‘s’ at the entrance.

“What the hell is that?” Fingleton said.

“That is not part of the mine,” I said.

We raised the barrels of our rifles and crept forward. At the edge of the opening a crater opened inwards and down. The inside glowed hot and somewhere at the bottom were glowing rivers of red. It was what you would expect to see if you peered down into a volcano about to erupt and send lava spewing into the sky. We pulled back our heads.

I crouched back from the edge and blinked my eyes. With each blink I saw the red of the pit the way you do when a bright light lingers after it is shut off before going to sleep. But it was not all red. A black shape broke up the red. It was the creature. It was down there.

“Did you see it?” I said.

Fingleton did not respond. He stumbled backward and fell. From a sitting position he raised his rifle in the direction of the shaft. I turned and saw black limbs extend up from the hole and take a grip of the ground, followed by the body of the creature. It was like a spider extricating itself from a drainpipe. It lifted itself and stood over us. Its red eyes glowed red and hot. Boxer barked up at the creature.

Fingleton shot and I followed suit. We emptied our weapons into the creature and it let out a piercing wail and fell back into the shaft and disappeared.

“Did we kill it?” Fingleton said.

“I don’t know.”

I inched toward the shaft and watched as the arms of the creature reappeared. It was coming back for more.

“Run,” I said.

We ran back from the direction we’d come. We made it to the section of tunnel with lights overhead and I looked behind and saw the creature on the move and coming down the tunnel towards us. We were almost at the first fork when the lights above flickered and then went out. I collided with Fingleton and we both went to the ground.

I heard Fingleton tapping against something plastic and his flashlight came on. The beam of light pierced the dark and he pointed it down the tunnel and grabbed me by the arm and with the other I scooped up Boxer. We were up and running and were through the fork when Fingleton stopped dead. The sound of footsteps echoed in the tunnel, but they were not ours. Fingleton searched with the flashlight and caught Elliott. He sprinted past us as if we weren’t there and headed deeper into the mine. He was going to the creature. Elliot’s head was covered in a ball of black. It had him.

“Stop,” Fingleton yelled.

We ran back to the fork and Fingleton shone his torch down the tunnel. Elliott stood before the creature. He turned to us. “It wants me to go with it,” he said.

Elliott raised his rifle and turned it on us and there were flashes of light as he shot. I grabbed Fingleton and pulled him back down the tunnel and around the corner.

“Are you hit?” I said.

“No, I don’t think so.”

“We have to get out of here.”

“What about Elliott?”

“He’s gone.”

Fingleton rose and ran towards Elliott and the creature, refusing to believe he could not help. He reached the corner and more shots drove him back. Elliott cackled and it echoed off the walls. Then the creature growled and Elliott screamed.

I grabbed Fingleton. “He’s gone. We have to go or we’ll join him.”

We raced down the tunnel to the exit, the flashlight jerking in Fingleton’s hand. Ahead Talia lay in a crumpled yellow mass in the middle of the rails. We got to her and Fingleton picked her up. We staggered the remaining distance to the entrance of the tunnel lighting our way ahead. Fingleton shot the flashlight back behind us but there was only an empty mine shaft.

We spilled out into the snow. The icy wind took my breath away and I zipped up my jacket. Fingleton pulled the mask off Talia, who wiped away strings of sweaty hair from her eyes.

“The tail of the creature, it came for us. It came for me first, but I put my mask on and it couldn’t get through. Then it went to Elliott,” she said. “And then the lights went out.”

She pulled up her knees and buried her face in her arms. She didn’t need to be told what had happened. Elliott was not with us when we exited the tunnel and that told the story.

“What do we do now Chief?” I said.

Fingleton looked at his watch. “It will be getting dark soon.”

The storm had not abated. The wind whipped across the open ground between the mine and the forest edge. The corrugated iron roof on a nearby structure bowed upwards and slammed back down on its supports with a bang. The broken gate swung away from the fence only to be driven back by the wind, the metal clanging upon impact.

“We go back to town.”

“We won’t make it back to town before dark,” I said. “But we could make it to my cabin. It will get us out of the weather.”

Fingleton nodded and he helped Talia to her feet. We rushed through the snow, watching behind for the black creature and its snake like emissary, but we didn’t see it again. Night came before we reached the cabin and we needed the flashlight for the last part of the journey.

Snow covered the cabin. Inside it was freezing. I lit a fire and a couple of candles and we huddled around warming our fingers.

Boxer collapsed on his bed of blankets and closed his eyes. Fingleton and Talia glanced around the inside of the cabin by the candle light. In all the years of living out in the forest I had never entertained any guest of any kind inside my home.

“I know it isn’t much,” I said.

“We’re glad to have it,” Fingleton said.

“I’ll put on a pan of beans.”

I took the pan down from its hook and placed it on top of the stove. I pointed to the shelf behind where Talia stood and she moved for me and I took a couple of tins and opened them.

We ate in silence. The world outside was dark and the wind did not relent. I did not have enough plates for everyone, so I ate last and from the pan.

When we finished, the cabin had warmed. I offered Talia my cot and covered it in a deer skin I took from the long box under the bed. She sat and leaned against the back wall of the cabin. She cradled her helmet like a teddy bear.

“It’s not your fault, what happened to Elliott,” I said. “Your helmet worked like you said it would.”

“You shouldn’t have come,” Fingleton said. He was like a stern father speaking down to a misbehaving child.

“Leave the girl alone,” I said.

“I don’t need you to speak for me,” Talia said. “I’m capable of speaking for myself and making my own decisions. I’m not a child.”

“You are a child,” Fingleton said.

“And you are not my father so stop speaking to me as if you are.”

Fingleton lowered his head and dropped his hands from his hips. He didn’t need to be told what happened to George Visser. The girl’s father had gone with the creature, the same as Elliott just had. “No, I’m not.”

Silence filled the room.

“How did you get Mrs. Potter to agree to you going out in the storm?” I said.

“I didn’t. I climbed out the window in the dark and went to the lake and waited. I figured you would be on foot in the weather.”

“I expected about as much.” I gave the girl a half smile, but her eyes were cast down on her plate.

“Will we be safe here?” Talia said, looking up.

“I don’t know.” I said. I wanted to answer in a way that gave the girl comfort, but I figured she would see straight through me, so I gave her the unfiltered truth.

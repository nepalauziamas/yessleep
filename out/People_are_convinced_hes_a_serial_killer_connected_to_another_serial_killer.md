Ok so basically I was lured to this ranch for work purposes and the dude ended up being a convicted violent sex offender who’s also been to jail for attempted murder and a suspect for this girls murder. Three separate woman in 2010 said it was his voice in this murder victim’s last call but he was “dropped”. I was at the ranch last year and he sent me voice messages and I recognized his voice as well, I also got my friend and her mom to listen they all recognized his voice . There’s a lot of stuff about him on the internet already , warnings, people suspecting he’s a serial killer from seeing things like multiple suitcases , peoples clothes , and shoes , and one person also said that they saw little girl underwear in his closet. The ranch predator also let me drive his truck and I noticed how the windows don’t open.. I made a Facebook post for my community , and it got me over 3k shares .. this lady commented and told me that he’s connected to Pickton (another serial killer in Canada different province) , . I posted that comment on my post,, like a week later she told me to take down her name because she got a bunch of death threats from individuals. People I guess in my country don’t want to believe that there is an active serial killer that is just allowed to do what he wants .. 

Below is a section of what I wrote in post on the experience with the predator: 

Furthermore i found this missing jack family from 1989 got lured to a ranch by a sketch that looks exactly like (blank) , and he’s wearing same outfit he always wears for work at farm. Ironically when I took a picture of the horse on his property I managed to take one of (blank). So I got an app to make it less blurry and look at his features I asked a bunch of my friends to compare to the suspect from Jackson case , “holy f that is him how the f is he still running around?”was there reaction 
He also told the family he lured to the ranch about logging work? Kind of ironic how I did logging work with him… . When I showed my friend who met (blank) as well and compared him to the suspect on the jack family disappearance,  we read out the clothes that suspect  was last seen wearing, and my friend was like , “ is he trying to get caught? We have a photo of him in that same outfit described from 1989 and he wore those at the farm,” . Yup (blank) did wear that outfit everyday at the farm his red checkered shirt, blue jeans, . Oh he also parts his hair the exact same way the suspect did! 

Update: 

1: After my post got a number of shares this lady commented that they know this guy from drinking In the bar in the 80s in Terrace BC, ,, really crazy since Terrace is around the bar the Jack family went to in the 80s. (Screenshot is posted on my Facebook post ) I also want to mention how (blank) tried encouraging me to move to his farm for good ,, and leave the city behind ,, .

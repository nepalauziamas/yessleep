Gentrification had been going on in the big city of San Francisco for some time now. All the holes in the wall spots with bomb food were now replaced with hipster coffee shops. 

The Muni 14 Bus had dropped me off in The Mission District. I grabbed my long board jumped out of the bus and hit the play button on my CD player. There I was a young Chicano kid skating down the streets of San Francisco. The time was 6:30 PM and the day was starting to set. I take a deep breath and let my surroundings and the setting take over.  The sky was foggy and grey above me, pigeons had taken over the power lines, and the paletero man’s bell was ringing on his dinky little ice cream cart. 

“Jorge!! Wait up Carnal!” I yelled out.

When Jorge turned around he looked different. He almost looked dead, and his eyes? His eyes were completely black. 

“Los Muertos! Los Muertos” He mumbled and took of running. 

What the hell is up with Jorge I said to myself. Oh well maybe he’s just drunk. 

I skated a few more blocks and at this point my stomach was starting to tell me that it was time to eat. I look into the horizon and saw nothing but chains, coffee shops and yoga studios. 

“Fuck it” I’ll eat at home I said hopefully mama is making something good, plus I only had like $5 to my name. 

I hit the play button my CD player then my jaw dropped and my heart skipped a beat. A low battery sign flash on the right hand corner of the display screen. 

“God dammit!!l I screamed! As my skateboard cruise down the dirt pavement of the city I noticed a beat up taco truck I have never seen before on the street next to the park. Maria’s Taco Truck.

A sign read on the side of the taco truck read:
 2 Tacos for $1.

2 Tacos for $1, Hell Yea looks like my luck is turning around.

As I approached the janky ass taco truck barely standing on its feet. I got greeted by the man on the window. I was taken a back by the way he dressed. He had a black top hat, white face paint, dark black paint around his eyes, and a creepy smile drawn across his face from cheek to cheek. I take a step a little spooked out. 

“What’s wrong Mijo, didn’t you know today was Dia De Los Muertos” he says in a creepy voice. 

“Yeah my old lady made me dress like this for a performance at a school earlier. We had music, food and lots of dancing. Alright what can I get you kid” he says.

“2 tacos de Asada please”. I said

“Coming right up” the man said.
 
There sat my food on a plastic paper plate wrapped with piece of plastic. My 2 Tacos looked delicious covered with onions and cilantro. I scarfed down my food and continue to skate to the bus stop. About 5 minutes later I feel this euphoric feeling take over my body, I feel like brain fog is completely gone, and I have to is tremendous about of energy. I feel alive.

I’ve been drugged was the first thought that came to my mind. This motherfucker drugged me! I shoved my fingers down my throat and start puking on the side of the side walk. I had puked everything I ate. 

WHOOP WHOOP. The police sirens go as SFPD pulls up right next to me. Oh great I just got drugged now i am going to get harassed by the cops. The police officers roll their windows.

“You good kid? The young cop says.

“Yea I think I just had some bad Mexican food maybe the meat they used was old or something” I said.

“Was it from an old taco truck that said Maria’s Taco Truck? “the young cop said. 

“Yes, have why have you had it?” I asked him.

“Motherfucker. Where is truck parked at!” he yells out.

“Over by the park” I said. 

His turns his sirens and lights as he screeches out of the street.

After throwing up I felt back to normal. I hopped back on the bus. As I looked out the window enjoying the all the lights filling up the city. I just thought to myself what a crazy fucking day. I pull the cord, and the bus announces my stop: 14th and Mission. 

I walk into my house and my whole family is watching the news. 

“The announcer news says the following:
Breaking News. Today was a day we will never forget.  We have reported as of right now 110 People passed away today in a mass suicide after eating at a taco truck in San Francisco. The Mysterious taco truck appeared in several parts of City today…”

My jaw fell to the floor and A million of thoughts raced in my head as the news report played in the background. All of the sudden everything goes black, and I faint. 

I wake up and all I see is the man in the black top hat staring at me with his creepy smile painted across his face.

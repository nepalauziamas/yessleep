I can’t include patient names and will be using a fake name for this surgeon, Dr. T, for obvious reasons. As much as I’m looking for advice, I need to keep my job. Now more than ever.

I try to stay more low-key about my personal beliefs, but I would call myself a non-traditional Methodist. You won’t find me in church on Sundays—my previous work schedule wouldn’t allow it. But that's never been where I renew my faith. If there’s any real-world metric for miracles and resurrection, you’ll find it in the operating room.

That’s always been the draw of transplant surgery for me. The hours are terrible, but there’s nothing more thrilling than watching a surgeon physically take the disease out of someone and implant hope. Of watching a patient get a second chance.

I had worked as a scrub tech for more colostomies, CABGs, and mastectomies than I could count, and those were fine, I guess. But transplant surgery called to me enough that I was willing to move away from a city center and to a more rural hospital simply because it was the only in-state position I could find.

The transplant program was new to this hospital, started up by Dr. T. It was really exciting, actually: a local option for the rural folks who couldn’t make the four hour drive for transplant work-ups in the city. And Dr. T was a fresh attending surgeon, with excellent marks and an extensive surgical record from his residency and fellowship. Things were off to a good start.

The other draw of this program, for me, was that it was a move close to home. I never got on with my parents particularly well—they took religion to a whole new level and didn’t think my interest in the sciences complemented this. But after a few years of schooling and working in the city, I missed my sister, Kitty. She always had a soft spot for our parents and could never bring herself to leave, despite my pestering. She lived right next door to them and small town life suited her just fine.

Besides, Kitty had always been a bit of a homebody. My frail little sister had trouble keeping up with the other kids and always had an inhaler on-hand. She preferred to hole up with a good book, and this trend had continued into our adulthoods. I actually thought me being back in town would be good for her social life. We could go get beers in one of the two bars in town, and I could play wingman for whatever guy or gal caught her eye and help her kickstart her life away from our parents.

My first day on the job was a month ago. A nurse walked me around and showed me the OR, the supply rooms, the locker rooms. Standard stuff. Not impressive facilities by any means, but they’d work.

The first warning sign was when she said they had good work hours. I laughed a bit at this, assuming she was being sarcastic. But she just continued to smile earnestly. My laughter petered out and I asked if she was being serious.

*The timing always seems to be good. The call-in and organ ETA just always seems to line-up with work hours. I haven’t worked a night case since…. God, I can’t even remember. Or a Sunday, now that I think about it.*

I was lost for words. She must’ve seen the shock on my face because now she started laughing.

*We’re lucky, here,* she chuckled. *Blessed, even.*

Next, she took me up to the floor to meet some of the patients. I was honestly shocked at the sheer volume of them, given how new the program was and small the hospital is. A lot of kidney transplants, as expected, but a couple of livers, and a heart or two.

They were all doing well, medically. Stable vitals, good blood work, well-controlled pain, eating without issue. But none of them looked like it. Their eyes were glassy and dull, purple bags underneath. Their steroid-round faces looked waxy and sullen.

I asked them how they were feeling and the general sentiment was that they were glad to be alive. No one went as far as to say they felt good. One of them muttered something about bad dreams.

One patient, a younger girl, stopped mid-sentence to grasp at a bucket. We turned away to give her some privacy and, on walking over to help her clean up, I was concerned to see black, thin liquid in the bin.

*It’s not blood,* the nurse said, as if reading my mind. *We’ve checked. It’s been happening to a couple of them recently. Seems benign. They’ll have similar stuff leak from their incisions too, actually.*

It was weird, of course. All of it. But none of it was… bad, per say. I would never complain about getting back to a more regular sleep schedule. And as someone who hadn’t experienced it myself, I couldn’t even begin to comprehend the impact a transplant could have one someone’s mental state.

As we walked back to the provider station, we finally ran into him: Dr. T himself.

I won’t deny that I found him handsome. Good teeth and cheekbones with a tall, athletic build. He was dressed smartly with a pristine white coat over a button down and slacks. He greeted me warmly and by name.

But his steely eyes were disconcerting. When he looked at me, it felt like he was drawing mental lines on where best to cut me open. Like he was dissecting me. When he shook my hand, it felt like he was gauging the quality of my bones.

I smiled politely but ended the handshake as soon as it was not awkward to do so. He told me how excited he was to have me join them, and how we were all going to do great things together. The nurse beside me nodded sagely. Something settled in the pit of my stomach.

I got home and called my sister over for a wine night. Draped over the couch with a glass of cabernet in hand, I told her about my day. She said that it was typical of me to look a gift horse in the mouth, and that my description of the surgeon sounded straight out of a cheesy romance novel. I threw a pillow at her, my unease forgotten as she launched into a coughing fit.

And so life moved on for a few days. Taking inventory, learning the ropes, and getting my feet under me. Hearing the nurses complain about post-transplant patients missing their follow-up appointments and not answering their phone calls. Seeing the adoration in *everyone’s* eyes as they talked about Dr. T. Spending evenings with my sister, largely at her place as she was too tired to go out.

Everything started to go wrong 3 weeks ago.

See, we have a lot of patients on the transplant list. But we’re a small hospital in a small town. Rather than operating, most of our time is spent waiting for something terrible to happen to someone else. We didn’t have any surgeries my entire first week, and I was itching for the call.

So of course I perked up when Dr. T confidently walked into the office, phone in hand.

His confidence was mostly carried by his expression. But his body language was more that of someone with a raging stomach ache: shoulders slouched and abdomen tensed. More than that, I noticed that his white coat sat a little more awkwardly on his frame compared to usual. He usually cut a straight silhouette, but his stomach jutted out a bit more today. Just one pinpoint area, a bit under his right ribs, that pressed against his coat.

His announcement, delivered in his usual smooth but firm voice: we had a pancreas coming in, slated to be here in 4 hours.

It was weird to me that no one asked any further questions. No one asked what had happened to the donor or where it was coming from.

The team spontaneously burst into a frenzy of movement, scooping up phones: calling the patient, coordinating operating space and a bed. My job for now was to prep the OR and make sure we had the correct tools there. An hour after the announcement I went to the stockroom, assuming I’d find the instrumentation pick list from Dr. T there. What I found instead was Dr. T himself, surveying the bins with hands in his pockets.

He looked… unwell.

He was as pale as the white tiled floor, eyes darting across the stockroom walls. His usually immaculately groomed hair was slick at the roots, and there was the faint sickly sweet smell of sweat. I couldn’t see his hands, but his arms were trembling almost imperceptibly.

Hoping I wasn’t overstepping any boundaries, I asked if he was okay. My experience is that surgeons don’t like to be reminded that they, too, can get sick.

*Yes,* he said briskly. *I’m fine.* *Just here to fill out the instrumentation pick sheet.*

*Are you sure?* I asked. *We can ask Hannah to take your temperature—*

It’s the only time I’ve ever seen him lose his composure: *I am* ***fine***, he snapped, fixing me with a red-eyed glare.

I instinctually took a step backwards, my back bumping against the shelves. The thought occurred to me that we were surrounded by many, many sharp items and this man knew how to use all of them effectively and unflinchingly.

But he didn’t.

He maintained eye contact for a few more heartbeats before turning back to the list, bringing a hand out to cross a few boxes before shoving it back in his pocket and stalking out of the room.

He didn’t apologize.

It wasn’t until after I resumed inventory that I noticed we were missing a scalpel.

…I didn’t want to follow him. I really didn’t.

But see where I’m coming from: most hospital costs are from equipment, and inventory is ruthless. And sure, it’s just one scalpel. But in their mind, pocketing one scalpel is the gateway to pocketing garbage bags full of stuff. They try to stop things early. And who are they going to point a finger at: the beloved surgeon or the brand new scrub tech?

No, I needed to get that scalpel back or my job could potentially be on the line. Of course, it might not be him. But he definitely was a prime suspect.

I finished my work, went back to the provider station and asked where Dr. T was. One nurse told me he liked to pray before cases and that I should just wait until he came back.

But I went anyway.

Rounding the corner, I spotted him: no white coat on, with a brown leather bag slung over his shoulder. Still pallid and shaky. He flipped a sign on the door: *Closed for Private Service.* Then he shouldered his way into the interfaith chapel and I quietly followed suit.

The chapel gets a lot of use, and the hinges on that door are some of the best-oiled ones in the entire building. It’s a large and well-lit room: Stained glass and an altar, with rows of cushioned pews. Unsurprisingly, the area is very Protestant-centric.

One addition that I’d always found to be an interesting choice is the confessional booth. I can probably count all the Catholics we had in town on one hand. But the hospital insisted anyway, stating it was a staple of worship and the area would be incomplete without it. (Not like they were putting in nearly the same effort for our non-Christian patients, but that’s beside the point.)

So there the confessional booth was in all its dark, dusty glory, with Dr. T slotting a key into a new padlock on it and slipping inside.

I don’t know why I didn’t make myself known. My logical brain says it’s because I knew it was weird they padlocked a public confessional booth and that he had a key. But my instinctual brain tells me it’s because I know something very, very bad would happen to me if he had seen me a second time in his current state. I slid behind a corner.

There was jostling. Movement as he rifled through his bag. The sounds of paper tearing and plastic bending. Muttering, words indistinct but reminiscent of the quiet prayers I’d heard my parents give under their breath growing up.

And then the telltale tearing sound of flesh. Whimpering not too long after.

Ten minutes. Ten awful minutes of tearing and whining and moaning and slick hands moving through liquid. And then at long last, the dull pop of a thick plastic lid, and the thud of something heavy and wet. I just stood there, rooted to the wall, stomach churning.

I could hear him breathing through gritted teeth as he rifled around, more plastic crinkling. I could almost imagine him, threading the surgical needle, tying the knot. Throaty groans and punctate sharp breaths as he closed. A slurping noise.

And then it was over. Fabric rustled and I dared to peek out from the corner, toward the booth. Out stumbled Dr. T, disheveled and wearing a thick black jacket zipped all the way up, leather bag over his shoulder once again. One hand clutched his abdomen and the other painstakingly re-did the padlock. He was still taking those wheezing, labored breaths. Before fully withdrawing the key, he paused for a moment. Breathed deeper. His eyes flitted to his right, and I yanked myself back into the corner before they flitted to his left—towards me.

Footsteps. The door opened and closed silently behind him.

Rising on shaky legs, I made my way to the booth. I tried the door which was, of course, locked. Then I peered in through the slats at the top, which were covered with a heavy black curtain. I had to wiggle my fingers through the holes, shifting the curtain inch by inch to the side before I could look in:

A dark wooden bench, globs of red and pink tissue and thick blood scattered across its surface. A stainless steel tray containing the missing scalpel, red and shining. A suturing kit and gauze, both open and bloody. A soaked towel. A transplant cooler, pristine and neatly placed against the wall. And almost comically, a juicebox: straw punched in and crushed cardboard walls streaked with red.

I felt like I was going to be sick. I *was* sick, actually. I stumbled over to a nearby trash can, bracing myself. I stayed there, head hung low, as thoughts bounced around my skull.

Who—or what—was this guy? Who else knew? The nurses weren’t asking questions, they knew he was “praying” and told me to leave him alone—did they know? Did they care?

Suddenly: a high, thin tone erupted from my pocket and made me jump. It was my pager prompting me to call the transplant nurse. I was acutely aware of how thick my voice sounded as I choked out a hello.

The nurse made no comment. She just wanted to let me know the pancreas would be here sooner than expected and I needed to get to the OR to set up.

Everything felt bleached and gauzy as I wandered my way through the halls. I kept my hand planted against the cold, tile wall, using it as my anchor to reality.

Was this real? It didn’t feel real. I stumbled along.

I saw him talking to the patient as I rounded the corner. He was strong and tall, voice unwavering and no sickness in sight. He was freshly showered and his white coat fit him appropriately, this time. I avoided eye contact as I entered the locker room.

I made myself focus on work, laying out the kits and gloves and lights. The patient was wheeled in, now asleep, and I felt nauseous as I wielded a razor and shaved his abdomen.

What had I gotten myself into? What were they doing to this poor man, and was I now complicit?

In walked Dr. T, all business. If he noticed my hands shaking as I helped him put on his gloves, he didn’t mention it. I had to turn away as he made the first incision, the sounds of the chapel echoing in my ears.

Usually, my favorite part is when they wheel in the cooler and crack it open. But this time, I felt my chest go tight as Dr. T reached in, gently scooping the pink, fleshy mass from the cooler. It *looked* like a normal pancreas, at least. But there was an impending sense of doom as I watched him guide it into the abdominal cavity.

Everything is blurry past that point.

The last part I remember from that day is being in the chapel again, after cleaning the OR. I didn’t *want* to look again, but I needed to confirm it. To make sure I didn’t imagine it.

But this time, the curtain was stapled to the door. I couldn’t see inside.

Someone knew I had been there.

X

Now, I’m not stupid. And I doubt Dr. T is, either. The joy—or bane, depending on who you ask—of modern medicine is that literally everything gets documented. The recipient doesn’t get to know who their donor is, but their care team does. My hope was that if people weren’t dying appropriately beforehand, I could bring this up with someone, somewhere.

But it *was* documented. 29 y.o. male in a motor vehicle accident. 34 y.o. female sustained a fatal laceration to the throat. These people were all listed as dying within an appropriate time window to theoretically have donated to their recipients.

Except for one.

A 45 y.o. female who fell down the stairs at a hotel and sustained fatal head trauma. Her medical record said she died the day of the transplant and then went on to donate a liver. But her obituary, written by her husband, said her fall was the day *after* the transplant.

It could have been a clerical error. But it bothered me.

Without concrete next steps, I called in sick for the next few days. So did my sister, actually. She told me she caught some respiratory bug and I fibbed and said I did too. We called each other and chatted throughout the day, with me making soup and talking about reality TV and her piping up occasionally from under a pile of blankets, voice hoarse and quiet. I very deliberately avoided talking about work.

I didn’t want to worry her. All she ever did was worry about me and our parents, and I wanted to figure things out more before I brought her in on this. I wanted to rule out any and all logical explanations before I took her down this rabbit hole with me.

But on the fourth day, I called and Kitty didn’t pick up. She didn’t respond to my texts, either. And finally, I drove over there and let myself in. She was unconscious on the couch, tinted blue and breathing shallowly. Her fingertips were swollen like balloons.

We had to take her to the hospital. Of course we did, what choice did we have? Seeing her on that ventilator was something out of my worst nightmare.

She stabilized, somewhat. Enough to get the tube out and be on nasal oxygen. But they still insisted on keeping her admitted, saying she could need to go back on the ventilator at any point. Then came a conversation I never thought I’d have to be a part of.

Do you know how much a double lung transplant costs?

I won’t make you look on Google: it’s $1.3 million, uninsured. And my sister is, of course, uninsured. Our hospital is underfunded and their charity program is basically non-existent. We started up a GoFundMe, but we’re far from the only people buried in medical bills on that site.

And not only that. It can take months—*years*—to find an appropriate donor. Her current prognosis is incremented in weeks.

Dr. T came in to talk with her. I thought about saying no, but he’s the only transplant surgeon here and it would have raised too many questions. My stomach twisted as he sat next to my sister, talking in that soft voice and placing a reassuring hand over hers. His chest was swollen beneath the coat. He told her he was going to do everything in his power to get her new lungs as soon as possible. That he couldn’t make promises, but he was anticipating maybe in a few days, maybe up to two weeks. I had to watch as my parents collapsed into tears and told him he was sent to them by God, and that they had total faith in him.

He put a hand on Kitty's shoulder, turned to look me in the eye, and said: *I’ll pray for you all.* It all felt like a joke.

I can’t leave now.

We need money. And even if I found another job, I don’t want to leave my sister like this. I insisted that we have her worked-up at another hospital, but she keeps saying her odds are better to get a transplant here anyways, and she doesn’t want us to have to pay for the transport.

I don’t want *him* to put anything in my sister. I don’t want these people taking care of my sister. I don’t want her to end up like those other patients, hollow-eyed and haunted.

But more than that, I don’t want my sister to die.

I don’t know what to do. I keep praying, but I don’t know what to do. Praying doesn’t even feel right, anymore.

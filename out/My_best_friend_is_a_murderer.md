We met in kindergarten, she was always the “weird girl”.  Like the type that would hurt you if you did them wrong, examples are telling their secrets, snitching, stole from them, or did anything of the sort.  Though she would never do anything serious though just tripping you, or pushing.  One we started growing up, picture two 7th grade girls, she would tell me about how much she wanted to kill everybody around her.  Her mom, her dad, her gramma, her little sister, her older brother, are teachers, are classmates, and me.  I always figured she was joking, I never thought she would actually do anything, but when her 7 year old sister died from something in her food, poison. She had told so many times about how she was no longer the favorite child, she said she was nothing, she told me she did.  I thought she was joking, or maybe I just didn’t want to believe she was capable of doing such thing.  When we were freshman she started shoplifting everything she could see.  If she saw a cute necklace she would put it in her big fluffy afro, no one knew about it, except me.  She told me everything, I told her everything. I was her only friend and since I was friends with no one dared to be near me.  She was the type of girl who parent warned you not to be around because of how acted, other than that she would of fit in perfectly with the popular girls, she was semi smart, pretty, mean, two faced, just think of the popular girls at you school, that was her or could’ve been her.When I found out, we were nineteen, I was living in a college dorm, she didn’t want to go to college, she would say “I have better things to do” now I know what she meant by that.  I went over to her house to hang out, she ran to the store to by some chips.  I realized that I actually didn’t really know much about her house, so I decided to look around.  I found her room, two guns.  I thought nothing of It at the time, considering her dad was the so paranoid of something happening to his “sweet baby girl”.  I entered the basement, pitch black, no windows.  I walked around looking for a light when suddenly I stepped on something soft and hard a the same time, she spilt some food and couldn’t be bothered to clean it up, right? I finally found a light, turned it on and then she ran in screaming holding an axe.  I saw the ground that wasn’t food, it was her high school bully who had just recently gone missing.  Righting all over the walls I would have read it if I had time, but I knew I didn’t. I was always first place in any contest on our teach team in Highschool so I thought I could put run her, but then I remembered she was always first.

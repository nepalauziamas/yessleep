I don’t even know how to start this.

How do I start this?

[How’s that?](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/wal46k/when_i_was_8_years_old_i_discovered_the/) 

I’m using this time before I go into what’s been happening over the last few days, to call out the past version of myself. 

I should have listened. I should have known that fighting against one of the biggest companies in the world, and trying to rescue two ghosts, would be a death sentence. You told me in the comments, and you were right. The truth is I’m not going to win this fight and I should have given up. I should have listened to my therapists and let Flynn and Princess Rapunzel go.  

Because now? There’s no running away. They know my name. They know my family and friends.

They know that I’ve been making these posts—that I’m telling the world their horrific secret and naming their victims.

And they’re not going to stop until they’ve sealed my mouth shut for good.

Please note: The events I’m going to be talking about in this post happened a few days ago.

I ended this abruptly due to a panic attack.

I thought I could relay what happened to me, but I didn’t realise how badly it would affect me mentally. I genuinely did not know what else to say, and I had a bit of a breakdown and struggled to continue.  I apologise for that. My next posts detailing this experience at Disney, and my attempt to bring their horrific actions to light, will continue to be published over the next few weeks, but know that my situation currently has improved, and I am in an undisclosed location ready to post more.


…

Three days ago, I considered taking my own life.

I mean, I thought about it. I would rather kill myself than be crushed to death inside a room full of desecrated bodies—bodies I was scared still had their self-awareness. As a child, The Scarlet Room had been a nightmarish hell full of monsters with metallic gnashing teeth who ate princesses. The reality of the room was a dumping ground for the shells of kids turned into Disney’s best and brightest. 

The suited man who kidnapped Jasper’s words were still reverberating in my head. Words I hadn’t fully taken in at the time, but they were just hitting me—like lightning bolts. Each one felt more and more personal, the teeth of a knife stabbing into my back. “Our performers aren’t supposed to have self-awareness. If they did, it would drive them crazy—and would you blame them? Years spent in relaxing slumber only to waken and find their bodies gone.”

“What’s that supposed to mean?” Jasper struggled in the guard’s grip. “Let me go!”

“The mind, Jasper. Tell me. What is it?” The man leaned forwards with his arms behind his back, a smile curving on his lips. “Is it something tangible? Something we can touch. Or is it more of a theory? Just the ramblings of retired scientist.”

Something struck me. How did the man know Roman’s brother’s name?

“What?” Jasper’s gaze wouldn’t leave Flynn’s face—even when he was dragged further back. “What are you talking about?”

“Potential.” The man replied. “It is prospect in its purest form; and has been for almost sixty years—an idea of our founder, our creator.” His expression seemed to enjoy the kid’s manic struggling.

“Because why, when you have created the most magical characters, working day and night to bring these ideas into reality and then pen onto paper, and in these modern times, pen onto tablet-- and breathed as much life into them as possible… why on earth wouldn’t you recognize the potential of the human mind?” When Jasper spat at him, he gripped the boy’s chin and forced Roman’s brother to look at him. “Our brains are extraordinary. Human beings leave the brain to rot inside an organic shell. Which is of course such a waste of...”

He spread out his arms, his eyes growing cartoonishly wide, waiting for a squirming Jasper to finish his sentence.

Jasper didn’t. The kid was too busy screaming at me for help.

“Potential.” The man finished for him. Even speaking cryptically, his words sent shivers ripping down my spine.

“That is what it comes down to.”

And ever since he had spoken those words, they wouldn’t leave me alone.

Neither would Jasper’s screams, still echoing in my brain, an endless loop of my name in a shattered screech.

They wouldn’t leave me alone when I risked lifting my head from my knees and staring at the pile of decomposing flesh in front of me. So many kids from different time periods, all with the same story—kidnapped and murdered, their minds and bodies purged and twisted into a child’s fantasy. And somewhere, deep, deep underneath, were Roman and Maya. Princess Rapunzel and Flynn Rider. 

There was nothing I could do for them. In a way, I wondered if this was my karma. I abandoned them when I was eight years old, and ten years later, I was getting my comeuppance. I wanted to do something for them, pray for them, maybe even find their rotting bones, and hold them to my heart. But I couldn’t move. I couldn’t breathe.

I couldn’t—think straight.

I mean, come on, I was seriously considering digging around for rotting bones as a way to apologize to two people who were long dead. But knowing they were gone wasn’t even the start of the torture, the endless hopelessness drowning me.

They had taken Jasper.

Disney had dragged Roman’s younger brother to the same horrific fate that I wasn’t even sure of anymore. I knew they scooped everything which made them human, turned them into Disney characters, and dumped their bodies in The Scarlet Room. But the suited man’s speech—even if they were the ramblings of a clearly insane man, what if they were real? Why so much talk about the human brain and consciousness and so-called potential if they were just that… dead. 

Every time I thought about it my head hurt. I didn’t want to think about it. I didn’t want to think about the possibility that this horrific situation I had found myself in went even deeper. The kind of shit not even Zach’s conspiracy blogs could make up. I thought about Zach, Tommy, and Key. They were safe…for now. As long as I didn’t try anything, they wouldn’t be in danger.

But I couldn’t just… I couldn’t leave Jasper to their mercy. I let them take him. I know I keep writing this, but the thought won’t leave me alone. I had done nothing to stop them, but how could I? Could I really do something when we were surrounded by guards? There were two of us. Me, an eighteen-year-old with no weapons, and him, a sixteen-year-old kid with a lighter. 

We were screwed from the start, from leaving that room and stepping out into the wild—clinical hallways inside the tunnels underneath the park. Now that I’m going over what happened in my head, I feel like if I could go back, if I could change time, I would. But shit like that is fantasy. This is reality, and I was frozen. Jasper, after seeing his brother’s state, wanted to fight. 

But he was just a kid.  I remember not being able to move, half-aware of something metal protruding into the back of my skull. A gun. But my brain had been screaming. Fight or flight. Survival. And I had chosen my own over his.

I know most of you reading this would say you would take the selfless choice and save someone else. But that’s a lie. 

You’re human, and I’m human. When adrenaline kicks in and fight or flight takes over, logical thought is gone. In this case, I stood there and watched stupidly, as Roman’s younger brother was dragged away, kicking, and screaming, yelling my name—like we knew each other. Like we weren’t just friends by circumstance. Like he actually fucking trusted me. 

Why did he trust me?

That’s what I kept thinking. Why did he trust that I would save him? I did nothing when the suited man had grabbed him. I let those bastards shove me into The Scarlett Room, and I didn’t fight back. I failed to save his brother.  

So, why were his eyes wide with desperation and hope, that I wouldn’t make that same mistake? I led Jasper here. I had been the one to make that stupid post and brought him to the slaughter.  So, in my twenty years of life, I had somehow indirectly led three innocent people to a fate worse than death. And now I too was going to die. Or more specifically, I was drowning in my own self-pity.

You’re allowed to throw yourself a fucking pity-party when you’re sitting on emaciated skulls and ancient blood.

I had regrets.

I’d cheated on my math final in junior year and somehow gotten away with it.

I lied to Key about being into a random guy in our class because I was seriously crushing on her.

I pushed Zach away as a kid—even when he sat outside my room all day with his back against the door, telling me stories.

Have you ever known despair? I’m using that word instead of hopelessness or pain—agony-- because it’s the epitome of no feeling. Numbness. It’s giving up and surrendering yourself to the dark and coming to terms with either your own inevitable descent into madness, or death. I tried. I didn’t just sit there and break apart, even if I wanted to. I had a goal. 

I had to get the fuck out of there before they lay a finger on Roman’s kid brother—because I wouldn’t be able to live with myself if I lost all three of them. Roman, Maya, and Jasper. Three strangers. And yet I felt like I’d known them my whole life; like we had lost memories, and parallel counterparts who were friends in another world. They had left that kind of impression on me.

So, I did everything to get out of The Scarlet Room. I used Jasper’s lighter to set fire to rags of clothing I found lying around. I thought I’d be able to trigger a fire alarm or sprinklers, but nothing happened. I don’t know why I expected it to. I was in a fucking human blender. 

Of course they wouldn’t give a fuck about a blaze starting where they liquify human remains.

I screamed and battered the metal door until my throat was dry, until my stomach was catapulting into my throat. There was no way out. I didn’t know the timer was going to go off, but when it did, I was going to die. Initially, I refused to fall to that fate. 

I kicked and screamed and cried. I begged. I begged them to let jasper go, and release Roman’s body back to his family—or the one family member who was waiting. His aunt. But it was like screaming into a vacuum. Nobody was listening, and if they were they were laughing at me. 

Disney are a multi-billion-dollar company who no doubt bought Jasper and Roman’s parents' silence, as well as the police. They can do whatever they want, and nobody will bat an eyelid—as long as it’s buried in conspiracies and ghost stories. That realization is what weakened my hits on the door and sent me to my knees.

Nobody was coming for me. That’s what Roman and Maya must have thought.

When they asked me for help back then, they must have known that I was their only option.

No adults would believe them, and even if they did, they were being threatened if they so much as uttered a cry for help.

Not a soul was coming because they didn’t care. And if they did, they were taken out of the picture.

That is what I was. A witness to their secret. They were just getting rid of me. Killing two birds with one stone.

I’m not sure when it was when I started to drift slowly, bleeding into slumber. It was so cold, and I had wrapped my jacket around myself. I dropped my head into my arms and tried to force myself to think happy thoughts. But when I couldn’t, I thought about my could have been’s. 

Like, if I never had my first experience at Disney, I never would have found Roman and Maya, and I’d be blissfully, and yet ignorantly unaware of all of this. I was weaving all the different possibilities of a life wearing rose tinted glasses and frowning at the scarlet light blinking on and off illuminating the room in an eerie blood colored shade, when my phone buzzed in my jeans. I had already tried ringing the police, my mom and dad, any friend I could think of—and every call was disconnected. 

Slipping my hand into my jeans and pulling out my phone, I glimpsed at the screen, sitting up, blinking in the intense red light which had only gotten harsher. At first, I thought I was hallucinating. Maybe I’d gone crazy and was fantasizing. But I could feel the phone physically vibrating in the palm of my hand. My phone was on 98% which didn’t make sense. It was on 81 the last time I checked. The caller was an unknown number. I tapped answer.

I didn’t bother with pleasantries. “I need help.” I croaked, “I know this sounds crazy, but I’m at Disney—”

A sudden shriek of feedback startled me, and I almost dropped the phone.

Opening my mouth to speak again, more static came through, an overlay of hissing like I was tuning in a radio.

And then… voices.

They came in waves, like I was skipping over stations, filled with a manic buzzing filling my ears.

“No, Lily, you can’t drink that!”

“Oh my god, look at the guy in front of us! He’s—"

“No, I don’t want to ride it. It’s scary.”

“Should I answer this girl’s tinder message?”

“Maria! Don’t run!”

".... And then Joey told me he was sleeping with another girl. I could have--"

"Mommy, I don't like strawberry sauce!"

"Is that Elsa? Mommy, look, it's Elsa!"

Voices, I thought dizzily.

From up above—from patrons at the park. But they didn’t sound like they were coming from my phone, they felt… closer. Like they were deeply rooted inside my head. A sharp pulse of pain rocked the back of my skull, and I squeezed my eyes shut, trying to will them away. 

Stabbing end call didn’t work. They got louder, and louder until they were blurring into a barely comprehensible screech of white noise in my head. It felt like thousands of voices were being shoved inside my skull, an endless tide of yelling and crying, laughing, and shouting. 

I heard the names of strangers. secrets people would take to the grave, and parents regretting they ever came to the most magical place on earth. Shoving my head into my lap, I couldn’t drown them out. I couldn’t make them go away. 

They were endless, echoing in my skull until I slammed my hands over my ears. But that just trapped them inside my head. I can’t describe what this feeling was. I guess you could compare it to what a mind-reader feels like in any fictional story. But I wasn’t reading minds. I was being attacked by an endless wave of noise.

Noise, that suddenly without warning collapsed into static and then whirring, and finally, a voice started to form. Slowly, I could hear it latching itself to this connection, bleeding its way into my brain until it was right in the middle of the noise, and it was louder. Like a gunshot going off in my head. “Emma?” The voice at first was nothing but a sharp hiss of static, before it wound its way around my cerebral cortex and took centre stage. 

“Emmaaaa?” It sang—and I knew that voice. I both knew it, and I didn’t. The voice was Tommy’s; the same British accent curling around an invisible tongue. It was unmistakably Tommy, and yet I had never heard Tommy speak with this kind of tease, an attitude which felt almost outdated and wrong.

“I know you’re there.” The boy chuckled, “There’s no use ignoring me now, is there?”

“Tommy.”  I swallowed hard. Even if it wasn’t him, I still had to get help. “You need to help me.”

I was greeted with silence, followed by another burst of static.

“Tommy?”

I choked on his name again, pressing my head into my knees. It wouldn’t stop. This endless hiss of noise overlaying his voice. An explosion of laughter garbled in static sent my head flying up, a shiver creeping up my spine.  “Guess again, Sweetheart.”

“Who is this?” I demanded. “Listen to me. I need help.”

"Yeah, we get it, you need help-- blah, blah, blah." The boy chuckled. "Can we talk first?"

“What?”

I felt my whole body stiffen up.

I was looking for someone, searching the darkness for a voice which wasn’t there. There was something there. Something I couldn’t see, but my body could sense it. “You heard me.” The boy sighed, static hissing. “I want to talk to you. I’m so boooooooored—” 

When I twisted around, I felt something, like an electrical surge in the air, a crackling I couldn’t see. And it was driving me crazy. Like my mind was playing tricks on me. Spinning around in the dark, I couldn’t see anyone. But I wasn’t alone.

I hadn’t been alone since I’d been shoved inside there. But I refused to believe that voice—the voice inside my head, was real. “No offence to these Schmucks, but you’re the most interesting person down here in a long time.”

“Consider me offended.” A girl’s voice rang out. The noise collapsed into hushed whispers and giggles.

“Also, no fair! I wanted to talk to her.”

“Too bad, I was here first.” The boy said matter-of-factly. “Like I said, wait your turn, Pol.”

More static screeching, whispers morphing into incomprehensible yelling, a myriad of voices entangled inside my mind.

I think we've all established that Dylan is an ass. Why are surprised?"

“Agreed.”

“Fuck you, Dylan.”

“Anyway.” The main speaker—Dylan— cleared his throat over the dozen murmurs hissing inside my skull.

“Sup. Names Dylan. These days though, I mostly go by Charming.”

Something slimy squirmed up my throat and I struggled to swallow. “Dylan.” I said his name in a breath. I felt my body twisting around, still scanning oblivion around me lit up in scarlet light. “Where…” I blinked rapidly, “Where are you right now?”

“Right in front of you, Sweetheart.” He said, and my gaze fell on the bodies piled on top of each other.

Of course, I thought.

It only made sense, right?

That the voices in my head weren’t there at all.

Another guy, who sounded far too young to be in there, let out a sudden explosive laugh. "He's behiiinnddd you!"

"Real mature, Eddie." Dylan sighed. “Still there? Look, I’m sorry about the others. Just tune them out. Eddie’s from the 80’s, and Polly, the 70’s. And somehow they’re the loudest. You’d think they would have just… I dunno, faded away.”

“Nice try, Dylan.” The boy—Eddie—laughed.

“Asshole!” Polly chimed in.

Their voices combined into one singular hiss.

Squeezing my eyes shut, I shook my head. Tune them out? How could I tune out voices in my mind?

I squeezed the phone tighter, finding Dylan’s words in the seemingly endless murmur of noise. "Yes. I’m still here.”

“Look.” Dylan sighed, and I felt it again, something prickling against my bare arms. It wasn’t a breeze or the feeling of my skin crawling. It was something else. Like the sensation you get when you run your fingers over an analogue TV screen.

“We don’t mean to scare you, and yeah, sure, the sight is pretty gnarly. But, hey, we can’t feel anything. So just imagine you’re looking at a big pile of mannequins, alright?” I could hear the smile in his voice, the reassurance he was trying to convey, and it wasn’t working because part of me was already searching for his body. 

I was already trying to figure out how he had died, and when he had died, and who he left behind. Which time period was he from? Flynn had mentioned a Charming, but according to the suited man, they were multiple models of the same characters. 

Thinking about Dylan’s story distracted me from hurricane thoughts already clouding my mind. My eyes were stinging, but I refused to cry. It didn’t feel right to cry in front of an invisible audience who had taken up residence inside my head. “Roman and Maya.” I couldn’t help it, their names slipping from my mouth. I didn’t want to ask it, but I needed closure. If not for me, then for Jasper. Their broken aunt Lydia.

“Are they…are they with you?”

There was a pause, and the girl giggled. “Wouldn’t you like to know!”

“You’re talking about Flynn and Princess Rapunzel, right?” Dylan hummed. “Huh. I remember them. They were with me. The 2011 crew. Man, I haven’t spoken to either of them in years. The last time I did, I…” he trailed off, and I knew what he was going to say. His words matched exactly with what Flynn told me ten years ago. Dylan gathered himself, and I sensed, no, heard, that cacophony of voices murmuring to him. “Uh, yeah, I’m pretty sure they’re dead. Like dead, dead.” He scoffed, and I sensed bitterness in his tone. “Unlike us, they had the luxury of actually dying-- all of them dying. Body, and their Spark."

"Spark?" I whispered. His words felt like knives sticking into my spine.

Dylan had confirmed it, even when the suited man already had with his cryptic speech.

Maya, and Jasper’s brother were dead.

Flynn Rider and Princess Rapunzel, who I went back to save—were dead.  

"That's what we call it, anyway. It's what keeps us thinking. It's the metaphorical mind, the pieces of you which aren't all physical. Emotion, memory, feeling, and everything that makes you a living, breathing human. You know, your Spark.”

I couldn’t tear my eyes from the bodies. “I don’t understand.”

Dylan chuckled. “Well, why don’t I show you?”

“Show me?”

“Sure.” His voice pressed me to stumble over to the pile. “Alright. So, this is morbid, but why don’t you pick a body?”

“Dylan!” Polly hissed, and I resisted against crying out against her razor-sharp cry slicing through my brain.

“What?” He hissed back. “Jeez, Polly, stop sugar-coating it. Just let her do her thing.” He paused. “Emma?”

I nodded, on autopilot. I knelt in front of the first thing I could see; a dismembered girl’s head. She looked… recent. Like she’d died in the last few years. Her eyes were shut peacefully despite what I could only gather had been a painful death.

“Holly.” Dylan said. “I do my best to learn all our names. Old and new. Kids who prefer to stay quiet, and the loud ones. Holly is from 2017. She doesn’t talk anymore. I mean, she did at first. But it was mostly denial. She kept talking about college.”

“Delusional.” Another guy cut in. I could practically hear his eyes rolling. “That girl was living inside her own head.”

Their voices crashed inside my head like ocean waves, and I could only stare at the girl. She was dead, I thought. Her head had been removed from her body; her skull crushed. So, how—how could she still be thinking? Self-aware?

“I’m glad you asked!” Dylan said. “Now, look closer. Do you notice anything weird about Holly?”

I let out a sharp breath. “You mean other than the fact her head has been cleanly removed from her body?”

He laughed at that. It was a good laugh, less painful than the others. “Ha. I like that. But no. Look closer.”

I did, leaning over the girl. I didn’t see it at first. Her head was half covered with something bright orange, a jacket or something, but when I did, I retracted, a cry bubbling at the back of my throat. That same device which had been attached to Flynn and Rapunzel’s ear was connected to the girl—and to my shock it was lit up, a green light indicating it was on.

The air felt like it was moving around me, my skin prickling. Dylan’s voice felt closer. Like he was breathing down my neck.

“See it?”

I struggled to get words out. The girl in front of me was dead, her body a shell, and that thing—

“Is keeping her here.” Dylan finished my thought. “Yep. You’ve got it.”

His sharp hiss rattled my skull. “That’s what’s keeping us still thinking. Still feeling.” Dylan said. “As long as those things are still connected to us, we’ll live on. Forever, maybe—but I don’t want forever.”

He chuckled. “Seriously, people think they want to live forever and outlive their own body, but after ten years of this? Every day. Counting my none-existent breaths and way too many games of iSpy— it’s torture. And I mean actual torture. I’m one of their Charming’s. They took me in 2011 and I was two weeks away from turning eighteen. I went out for smokes for my old man, told him I’d come back and play COD with him. This asshole jumped me in the middle of the street, threw me in the back of a van and shipped me off to Disney.” 

His tone sent my stomach galloping. “There were six of us. Me, Mila, Janie, Roman, Maya, and Jay. They told us we were going to make kid’s dreams come true, and sure, I fought back. I pounded one guards face until he was spitting blood, but I still ended up here. Stuck in this prison.” 

When I straightened and stumbled back, Dylan seemed to know exactly what I was doing. “Dude, I should be 27 right now.” He said, “It’s been 10 years and I’m fucking tired, man. I just want to sleep.”

His voice splintered, and I wasn’t sure if it was him struggling to keep it together, or the signal in my head weakening.

“Can you help me sleep, Emma?”

I found myself nodding. How could I say no? Was I really going to force this kid to live through endless years of nothing?

“What do I need to do?” I asked.

But I already knew.

“Just pull it off.” Dylan said. “We’re just footprints in the snow. Think of it like a band-aid you’re ripping off.”

“Right.” I said through my teeth. I scanned the pile, but there were so many. “Where are you?”

“Look for a bright pink shirt. I was wearing that underneath my stupid costume.”

I’m not going to describe how long I spent digging through rotting flesh. When my fingers were suddenly grasping hold of old threaded pink material, and Dylan felt so close—almost like he was right there next to me—I pulled blindly reached for where his head was, and my fingers grazed smooth metal glued to his ear. I told myself to ignore his mostly emaciated body, a skeletal mouth grinning up at me like that teasing laugh was still there. 

When I touched the earpiece, it didn’t feel like what I thought it was, a Bluetooth device. No, the thing was stuck to the corroding flesh of Dylan’s ear, like it was part of his flesh. I thought back to Rapunzel—Maya—poking at her arm and telling my little self she still had patches of flesh. I had looked past that as a kid, but now it was in my face. 

Flynn’s arm glistened like metal. They weren’t just forcefully turning kids into characters—they were twisting organic into metal. Flesh into metallic shells which resembled human skin but wasn’t.

“Emma? Dylan said. “Hey, you’ve gone quiet.”

“What did they do to you?” I whispered, echoing Japer’s cry to his brother.

“Nothing much. Just kidnapping, murder, and a side-helping of transmutation.”

“What do you mean?” I squinted at the green light.

“Well.” Dylan said, “If you were an evil corporation and had all the technology of the world at your disposal, you would use it, right? To make sure your precious fucking cartoons stay alive.”

I poked at the metal shelling on his body. “How did they do this?”

“Emma, have you heard of nano-bots?”

“Nano- what’s?”

“Never mind. My time’s up, anyway.”

 I could sense his nervousness. “I don’t mean to push you, but I’ve been kiiinda waiting for this, for like, ten years. 

“Don’t you want to say goodbye?”

He scoffed. “Goodbyes are for losers.”

I nodded, trying to keep myself together. I told Dylan that he was brave, and he said he was going to close his non-existent eyes and wait to “fall into the great beyond”. I was crying when I pulled off the corroding metal from his ear—and instantly that connection, that signal which had come to life in my head, was severed. It felt like something had been ripped from me, leaving an empty cavern. I called his name, just to see if he was still there, but I was met with a silence. Peaceful silence.

When I was alone, I told myself I wouldn’t break down. I wanted to tell the others that I would try and save each and every one of them before my time ran out, but when I was reaching for the device on the body of a boy who had died far too young, a hiss startled me into reality. I knew that voice. I knew it, and I almost broke down hearing it. “Emma!”

I tipped my head back, my gaze going to the ceiling.

“Zach?” I cupped my mouth. It didn’t make sense why – how—he was there, but in a way, it also did.

“How did you know?” 

“I had my suspicions,” He replied. “First Tunnel. Rabbit Hole. Fairy Dust. Big Red Button.” His laugh was shrill, “Emma, you’ve been saying that stupid manta since we were little kids. Remember when you forced me to play it when were nine?”

I did. Part of me did, at least. I didn’t realize I’d dragged my neighbor into my childhood trauma.

“When you jumped off at the first tunnel, it pretty much confirmed my thoughts.” He said, “Not to mention, you kept talking about the It’s a Small World ride in the car. As soon as that kid in front of us disappeared, I knew you were going to follow.”

“Because—”

“Because.” He said, “That was always my first quest as your knight. I had to jump off the boat at the first tunnel.”

I could have cried. Instead, I laughed.

"So, are you planning on telling me why you're down there? This is the rabbit hole, I’m guessing.”

"It's hard to explain."

"The Prince and Princess you made me save back when we played those games. They're real, aren't they?"

Before I could speak, he cut in. "And this time you're trying to save them."

“I saw something when I was eight." I said, "It’s Disney. They're turning kids into live-action cartoons. And it’s… it’s brutal.”

"Wow. That’s darker than any conspiracy I’ve heard.” He paused. “I don’t suppose Walt’s head is with you…”

“Zach.”

“You’re right. I’m sorry.” He hissed out. “I’m freaking out right now, and cynicism and jokes are all I have.”

"Zach, you need to get help.”

“Really?” He scoffed, “Emma, we’re talking about Disney, here. Who exactly is coming to your rescue?”

He was right. But still, I wasn’t dragging anyone else into the mess. I made that mistake with Jasper.

“Find Key, and Tommy.” I said, “And then go home. Don’t speak to anybody.  I’ll find a way out myself.”

 “Yeah, that’s not going to happen.”

I heard shuffled footsteps. “Uh, how deep is this thing?”

I gritted my teeth. “Zach, if you come down here, I’ll kill you myself. There’s no way out.”

“And?” I could hear the grin in his voice. “Two people is better than one. We’ll figure it out.”

“No!” I yelled. “Are you crazy?”

When I was met with silence, I thought he’d listened to me. But then a shadow was dropping from the ceiling and landing on the pile. I started forwards towards him, throwing myself through rotting bodies, but something stopped me—the lights flickering and then going out. That same pain pulsed in my head, and I sensed it, and then smelled it, an electrical surge singing the air. My phone screen flashed erratically, and I felt it, that same skin crawling feeling creeping down my spine.

“Zach?” When the lights came back on once again bathing the room in scarlet, I scrambled back onto the pile.

I found my best friend kneeling over a girl’s corpse, and a what was left of a threaded backpack. Zach was sitting, staring, his eyes not quite on anything. When I grabbed his shoulders and turned him to face me, he blinked slowly.

“Okay.” Zach croaked, his gaze finally finding mine. “I’m… I’m sitting in dead people.”

"It's a lot to take in." I whispered. "But you have to stay calm. Zach. Look at me."

He did, but his shoulders were shaking. “Yeah. Yep, I’m totally fine.”

“Are you sure?” I used my phone as a flashlight. Zach’s eyes were wide, his lips twisted into a silent cry, but I was so happy to see him; his stupid hair which he never brushed, and the baseball cap he never took off. I never thought I’d see it again.

For a moment, something flashed in his eyes, a slither of something my gaze caught. But I wasn’t going to let mind tricks dictate my thoughts. It was just the flashlight. I grabbed and wrapped my arms around him, and when he was pressing his face into my shoulder, I pulled away and hit him in the chest until he jumped up and brushed himself down. “Yeah.” He frowned down at his hands, his fingers grazing his cheeks, and then his arms.  “Yeah. I’m... I’m totally okay. Just shaken.”

“Are you fucking insane?” I grabbed his arm, pulling him off the pile. “Do you know what this place is?”

“Hell.” Zach murmured. He wasn’t listening to me, drinking in everything.

“I told you not to come down here.”

Zach didn’t answer, his gaze on the panel. He hurried over. “So. Big panel.” He twisted to look at me. “This has been here the whole time, and you didn’t think to mess around with it?”

Before I could stop him, he lay his hands on the panel. I reached out to stop him, but when his fingers grazed the buttons, a hiss sounded, and I caught a flash of electrical blue light flash across the panel before sizzling out. When he stepped back, the door, to my confusion, slid open. I stared. 

No alarms. No shouting or guards were waiting for us; just the clinical walls of that same corridor I had already seen. I turned to my best friend, and he frowned at his hands, and then at the panel.

“Oh. Looks like I broke it.” He laughed. “Wow. That was easy.”

He started towards the door, but I grabbed him. “How did you do that?”

Zach didn’t look at me. “I broke it.” He said, his tone flat, “Shouldn’t we be getting out of here—like now?”

I couldn’t argue with that.

Slowly, we edged towards the door. This time I checked to see if we were being pursued. I expected Zach to stay behind me, but he stepped in front of me. His expression had changed, flashing from amusement to cold determination. He took long strides, taking in each door we went past. I kept with his pace, peering in every room we passed. They all looked the same, either hospital like rooms, or storage. “Jasper.” I said in a sharp breath. “We can’t go yet. We find him, and then we go.”

Zach flashed me a look over his shoulder. “Jasper?”

"The kid I followed when I jumped off at the first tunnel. He's the brother of the boy I tried to save.”

He nodded. "Right. We'll find this Jasper kid, and then get out of here."

I stopped at the same room the suited man had taken us to. It was locked, but I had no doubt Flynn Rider was still in there.

Zach stopped too. "What is it?"

"Nothing. We find Jasper, and then we go."

He raised a brow. "Nobody else to save? Not even a certain Prince and Princess?”

I shook my head, swallowing hard. "They're... they're somewhere in that pile.. Jasper isn’t. We can still find him.”

There were twin doors at the end of the hallway.

Zach came to an abrupt stop. “There are people in there.”

“What? How do you know?”

Instead of answering me, he pulled open the door and dragged me with him. He was right. We were in a large room, an official looking hall, endless rows of seats in front of a stage lit up with white light. I glimpsed shadows of people in the audience.

“Shit.” Zach ducked behind the back row, pulling me with him.

The suited man from earlier was standing in the middle of the stage, his arms stretched out.

"Now, I know we haven't had a good retelling of this classic in years, but I'm here to bring the new generation the boy who never grew up-- a modern retelling. With him, I want to bring forward the idea for a brand-new attraction; Neverland Park, which will host all of our favorite characters. Including Hook, Wendy, The Lost boys, and more! Now, I give you... Peter Pan!"

The audience erupted into applause, and the light found another figure on the side of the stage.

Zach had to cover my mouth to stop a scream when Jasper walked out onto the stage; wearing light blue hospital scrubs, his arms by his sides, his head held high, and a terrifying animated grin on his face, empty eyes drinking in nothing. The man placed his hands on the boy's shoulders, and I glimpsed that same device attached to his left ear.

"Of course, this is just a prototype-- a stencil, some might say. We are in the beginning stages of creating the boy who never grew up. And! He happens to be a child of one our dear friends, as well the brother of one our longest running models-- Flynn Rider. This young man was set to be given to us in summer 2023, as written in contract, but we acquired him a little earlier than expected."

No, I thought.

No, no, no fucking way.

No way had Roman and Jasper’s parents sold BOTH of them to Disney.

No wonder they knew his name. The bastards had been waiting for him to become of age.

He turned to Jasper, and my stomach slithered into my throat. “Peter, why don’t you tell us something about the new attraction?”

The boy responded by opening his mouth, though gibberish came out as his gaze penetrated everyone and everything.

The man chuckled. “He’s not finished yet. Like, I said, he’s just a prototype. He will be. Given the green light.”

An oldish looking man stood up. He practically oozed importance.  “As you wish. Bring the new Neverland to life. Not the park, idea. That has already been done. I look forward to seeing our Peter. And hopefully, I can see this perhaps bringing a resurgence.”

“Yes, sir. I’ll start the process as soon as we’re finished here."

“Well, fuck.” Zach muttered. “I’m guessing he’s the kid. I don’t mean to be ‘that’ guy, but he doesn’t look like he’s coming around anytime soon.”

“No.” I said it out loud, but not loud enough to be heard over the audience’s murmurs. I couldn’t breathe I was so angry, my body felt like it was burning. I felt Zach’s arms around me, dragging me from the room before I could draw attention to us—but I was ripping myself from his grip and I was moving, walking, stumbling, with no direction. I clawed at my hair, pulling out clumps. I had to find him, I thought dizzily. 

For his dead brother. I had to find him and bring the kid back to his aunt. I was blindly grabbing at doors until one gave way, and I staggered into the cold. I felt it on my skin automatically, like I’d stepped into a freezer. But that’s the thing. I had stepped into a freezer. The room was large, lit up in icy blue light. It was like a morgue. Wrapping my arms around myself, I felt like I was walking on air. I saw their names before anything else.

They were printed in bold on each metal container.

Flynn Rider — Roman Icarus.

Rapunzel - Maya Hawkings.

Aladdin — Jay Zanibaf

Cinderella-- Janie Michaels.

Sleeping Beauty – Mila Brighton.

The man’s speech from earlier came back to me. “Would you like to wake up after being asleep for so long, without a body?”

I was already gripping the metal handle, my heart sinking into my gut.

Before I could pull it, something hard slammed into the back of my head, and I dropped to my knees, and then to my stomach, my head spinning. Zach. I thought. Someone had hit me—a guard? 

Which meant they had Zach. 

When I tried to get up, adrenaline sending me into fight or flight, a foot came down on my spine, forcing me back onto the icy floor. Fingers twined around my ponytail and yanked my head up, and I felt it again, prickling in the air. Blinking back feathered vision trying to plunge me into the dark, I glimpsed a shadow looming over me.

I recognised his messy hair, the stupid baseball cap which I was convinced was glued to his head. Zach. Not a guard. When he bent over me, eyes flickering with something inhuman, I caught a ripple in his skin rewriting matter, organic turned metal, a sliver of silver writhing its way across his temple, forming a metallic plate. 

“I like you, Emma.” He said, pulling on my ponytail again. I gritted my teeth against a screech in my throat.

“I really do.” His smile wasn’t his. It was someone else’s. “But I really didn’t want you to find this room.”

Zach’s voice was the last thing I heard when the sole of his converse came stamping down on my head.

“Now, where did you say those friends of yours are again?”

…

Like I said at the start of this post, this is hard to write—but I will continue soon.

Pretty sure Zach’s hit gave me grade 3 concussion and I’m still feeling it now. Almost four days later.

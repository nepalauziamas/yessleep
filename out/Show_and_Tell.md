When Mr. Norris asked everyone in class to bring in something old or historic from home, I immediately knew what I’d grab. My grandmother left me a record player, a massive thing made of brass and wood, along with a box of vinyls. Real retro stuff. I figured it would be a hit. But that was before Alan showed up with that horrible box and I experienced the worst day of my life. Nobody believes me if I tell them the truth and it’s hard to blame them. I wouldn’t have believed it if I didn’t go through that lockdown. Alan showed up to class that day so proud…

“Is this Latin?” Mr. Norris asked Alan when he brought the box up. 

Alan smiled and shrugged. “I’m not sure. It’s been in my family forever. I found it in the attic.” 

“Do you read Latin?” Norris asked. 

“Nope.” 

Norris twisted the box that way and this way. It was a little smaller than a shoebox and made from dark redwood with letters or symbols cut into it. The container was shiny like it was recently polished. I found it fascinating, though most of the class was tuning out. There was too much sun outside and we were too close to summer break. Since most of us were seniors, it would be the last break before college. Who could dredge up enough attention to focus on an old wooden box? 

Mr. Norris held the box up to eye level. 

“Well, I read Latin…kind of,” he said. “And I think this artifact you brought in, Alan, is *very* old.” 

Alan smiled again. I could tell he was happy to have the attention. He wasn’t the kind of guy that had a lot of friends–or any friends, as far as I could tell. Alan spent most of our classes sitting in the back row with his hood up, earbuds in, lost in his own world. 

Something about the box was bothering me. There was a sinister vibe to it and I winced when Mr. Norris opened it. Nothing happened. He closed the lid. 

“Some of the markings are faded,” Norris said, “but I think I can figure it out from context. Basically, it’s saying that there’s an invisible hunger trapped in the box and there’s a warning that you should never release it unless you’re among enemies. Hey class, are we enemies?” 

“Depends on whether you let us skip the quiz tomorrow,” I replied. 

That got some chuckles and a smile from our teacher. He cleared his throat and read slowly in a language I didn’t recognize. Latin, I guess. Again, nothing happened…at first. After a long moment, the lid of the box creaked open on its own. Alan frowned. 

“What in the world…” Mr. Norris began. 

He screamed. 

Inky figures came pouring out of the box like a stream of motor oil. They blended together until they splashed on the floor. Then they separated into twenty or thirty shadowy creatures, each maybe three feet tall. They reminded me of imps or goblins but featureless, just dark silhouettes. A few kids in the class screamed. I was glued to my seat, staring at the monsters, wondering if it was some trick. Maybe the box was a projector and they were holograms. 

One of the inky things jumped onto Alan, wrapping long limbs around his chest. The monster reached up towards Alan’s face, put its fingers into his mouth, and pulled his jaw open wider and wider until I heard tendons popping. The guy was trying to scream but the imp oozed into his mouth and there was only a wet gurgle. After a second, Alan closed his mouth and looked around the room calmly. We were all stupefied, even Mr. Norris. None of us noticed a second creature climbing up the wall behind the teacher until it was too late. It leaped on his back and, just like with Alan, forced its way inside of his mouth. 

That broke the paralysis over the class. Desks and chairs went flying as we all scrambled to run out of the room. Kids got knocked over, tripped, and slammed into each other in a mad rush. It was chaos. All of the while those little shadow freaks were jumping around and crawling into anyone they could get their hands on. I made it out of the room with a few others. The last thing I heard was Mr. Norris on the phone with the front desk. 

“...possible threat,” I heard him say. “We need to lock down the school.” 

A lockdown. We’d be trapped inside the school with the things from the box. Someone, somewhere, pulled a fire alarm. Kids came flooding into the hallway. 

“Get back in your rooms,” I yelled, fighting against the rush. “It’s not safe. It’s not-” 

The creatures made it into the hall and all Hell let loose. The lights went out the red emergency bulbs. There was screaming and shouting and monsters everywhere dragging my classmates down and forcing their jaws open. In all of the insanity, I managed to slip into a janitor’s closet and lock myself in. Somebody began pounding on the door but I just curled into a ball and tried to cover my ears to block the shrieking. The noise stopped soon enough; probably minutes after I got into the closet but it felt much longer. I counted to three hundred, then slowly opened the door. 

The hallway was empty. A few steps from my hiding place, though, I saw a shadow at the end of the hall. It was still dark with only the red glow from the emergency lights to see by but I could tell whatever was casting the shadow was short…and moving towards me. I considered diving back into the janitor’s closet but my original classroom was closer now. Besides, I hoped that would be the last place the monsters would look since that’s where it all started.

I ran as quietly as I could, ducked into the room’s open door, and gently pressed it shut. The lock turned with a satisfying *click*. I let out a long breath. The class was dark and, thankfully, empty. Alan’s wooden box was lying on the floor still open. The room was cold and got colder the closer I walked toward the container. How could so many creatures have come out of such a small space? Before I could get any closer to it, I heard the horrifying rattle of someone trying the locked door. The rattle quickly escalated into scratching, then slamming. 

They were going to get me. I looked around the classroom desperately but there was no other exit, not even a window. My eyes snapped to the box. It was shaking, nearly humming. A plan formed in my mind as the thudding continued behind me. I ran for the box but each step was more difficult than the last. It was like walking deeper and deeper into mud. *The box was fighting back*. By the time I reached it, I was on my hands and knees crawling. I touched the lid but yanked my hand away. It was so cold it took some skin off. Gritting my teeth, I tried again, howling in pain as I swung the lid inch by inch. Finally, it clicked shut. 

There was a chorus of screaming from out in the hallway; horrible screeching that got louder and louder until I couldn’t block it out even with my hands over my ears. That was the last thing I heard before blacking out. When I woke up, the lights were back on in the school. Two paramedics were kneeling down next to me checking my vitals. They loaded me up in a stretcher even though I insisted I could walk. 

I was only in the hospital for a day, just for observation. Then, a week later, I was back in school. Nobody remembered what happened…nobody but me. Our administration blamed the incident on a gas leak and any weirdness was attributed to the fumes. There was no sign of Alan’s box and I was reluctant to ask him about it. 

All of my classmates seemed happy to move on and I guess I am too. I don’t believe what I saw can be explained by a gas leak but I can’t exactly go around talking about shadow demons from an ancient box; I’d get strange looks. Speaking of, sometimes–just from the corner of my eye–I think I catch some of my classmates staring at me. Mr. Norris looks at me, too.

  “God, I’m cold. So cold.” This is the first thought that creeps into my mind as I begin the seemingly eternal crawl towards consciousness. The second, is the awareness of a dull throb. In my head. In my spine. Even my right shoulder seems to be engulfed in this sickening thud of misery. In perfect synchronicity, my entire existence pulses with the heat of a smoldering campfire.  Every heartbeat delivering a fresh burst of pain. As I begin to notice the familiar sounds of the city bustling about me, I allow my eyes to slowly draw open. Then, as I am smashed upon the shores of reality by a tsunami of nausea, I jerk forward. With eyes wide open, I retch onto the sidewalk upon which I am lying. After a moment, the heaves subside, and I am left drooling and staring at the miserable mess of bile and vodka scented remains of my last meal. It must be Thursday, I think, as I notice what could have once been fried rice in the contents of my expulsion. Too bad. I only get Wong’s once a week.


   With a shuddering breath, I push myself to a better seated position. Hands chilled by the cold concrete below me, I quickly bring them to my mouth in an attempt to begin blowing some warmth onto them. But I feel the slick remainder of my reverse breakfast dangling from my unkempt beard. A quick pass of my forearm across my mouth mostly removes the offending matter, and I wonder if I should have left it there. If only to add some color to the gray that has established its dominance over the recent years. “Fuck me! How did I ever get here?” I question myself yet again, knowing full well what the answer is. As always my thoughts drift back to what my life was before. Of the family I had left behind, yet still out there, somewhere. Leaning back against the brownish brick facade of the storefront behind me, I wonder if they ever think of me. Probably not. At least not in any way that could be considered positive or hopeful. “You made your bed...” I begin to muse aloud, and an actual giggle escapes me as I once again allow my eyes to drift to my proverbial bed. “Aw, fuck this. Time to move,” I mumble. 


   Still leaning against the wall, I use my right arm to provide some stability as I begin to stand. My knees pop, my back groans, and suddenly, my shoulder screams at me. Sonuvabitch! What the hell did I do to it? Nothing particular comes to mind, so I write it off as simply being a consequence of sleeping on the sidewalk again. I should probably find better digs. Especially with the weather becoming a bit chilly. Maybe I’ll head over to Marty’s pad for now. He wouldn’t mind it if I hang out for a few days. Marty is a helluva guy, and is what you might think of as a man’s man. And not in any sort of sexual manner either. He’s from the old school. The original grizzled old biker type. Vietnam vet and all that shit. Like the rest of our little circle, Marty has seen better days. But I wouldn’t fuck with him. No way. No how. And no thanks. Just a few weeks back, I watched Marty nearly kill a guy with his bare hands. Like to have torn him apart if we hadn’t jumped in. Some college asshole thought it’d be a real hoot to watch a bum-fight with a couple of his buddies. I guess, in a way, he got what he was looking for, and then some. 


   Yeah. I’ll go see what the old bastard is up to. I do a quick scan of the ground below me to make sure I’m not leaving anything behind. Oops! I almost left without my ball-cap. I lean forward to grab the grungy old gray hat, and smack! I bash my face into the glass pane in front of me. “Jesus fucking Christ,” I cursed. “Who the fuck put that there?” Staggering, I clutch at my nose. Shit, that hurt! I examine my hands, and am slightly surprised at the lack of blood. Looks like the beard is staying gray for a bit longer. There’s today’s silver lining, I guess. Little did I know as to just how much worse today was really going to turn out.


   Why in the hell would anyone install a glass panel here? What would be the purpose? And how did I sleep through the noise? Jerk-off could have maybe at least kicked my hat over to me, instead of placing a big ass piece of glass between me and it! I sigh and step to my right, in order to go around the panel, when my shoulder abruptly thuds into yet another god-damned glass panel. “W-what the hell?” I sputter, as I massage at my already sore shoulder. Placing my hands against the glass, I discover that the two panels are actually joined together in a corner right before me. What is this! I shake my head in a moment of confusion, then look up. It suddenly occurs to me that I can’t actually even see the glass. This is strange. I should at least see something at the corner junction. But even upon closer inspection, there is no visible indication of glass being present. Okay, enough lollygagging. I’ve got shit to do and vodka to drink. 


   I tilt to my left, to begin exiting this invisible oddity (art?) and have a thought. I reach out and my heart skips a beat. This can’t be! There is just no way that it’s possible! With both hands flat before me, I press against the newly discovered barrier. I turn and repeat this action with the panels before me and to my right. Nothing but solid glass on all three sides. I reach over my head to find more of the same about a foot above me. I’m completely enclosed, like some exotic pet on display!  Jesus! Is this even glass for that matter? Whatever this is, I’m having none of it! I angrily begin to pound on the panel before me. One, two, three times I slam into it with my balled up fist. It’s like beating on solid steel. Like beating on twelve inch thick solid freaking steel. There is not a single sound from my strikes, other than the meaty smack of my flesh and bone against.....nothing. With any hope of escape rapidly slipping away, my breathing becomes frantic. I turn to the store front and find myself looking right into a large picture window, where I see a couple of elderly women perusing the brightly lit shelves within. A bored looking young man is restocking cigarettes near the check-out stand. His bright red hair clashing with his green smock. As he turns to pick up some more stock, I see his name tag. “HELLO. My name is Bryan.” 


   Sorry about this Bryan, but I’m through with this shit. You’ll have to bill me for the window. I wriggle out of my brown quilted flannel shirt, and wrap it tightly around my shaking right fist, being sure to protect my wrist and as much of my forearm as possible. I tuck the dangling portion of the sleeve underneath the makeshift wrap. Drawing my left arm up to shield my eyes from any possible shrapnel, I reach back with my right and swing at the window. What resulted was a combined sickening splatter and a bone-jarring crunch.  “GAAAH! Fuck! Shit! Fuck!” I clutch my wounded extremity to my abdomen, and try to stomp away the pain. But each stomp only seems to bring anger instead of relief. After a couple minutes pass, the pain subsides. It’s not gone by any means, but it’s not as bad. The stars have faded from my vision, so I don’t think I’ll pass out. I turn back to the store’s window and start waving frantically to get someone's attention. Bryan. Hey Bryan! Look at me! Maybe one of the old ladies will see me. Everyone is too distracted. Either with their shopping, or their job, they are all too busy with something other than noticing me. After banging on my enclosure a couple of times, I give up. I jerk around to face the street. Being set back a bit from the main sidewalk, I’m not as noticeable here. Even though my alcohol saturated brain had been in ‘fun-time’ mode last night, there apparently remained at least a modicum of survival instinct. I had selected a sleeping spot that was somewhat set back from foot traffic, was covered, and offered a small amount of light. But now this bit of shelter may present a challenge. No matter. I have no other choice. 


   “Hey! Hey! Can some one give me a hand?” I shout. Nobody so much as looks at me. “Hey! Lady in the red hat! Lady!” I slam against the front wall, screaming. “Yo, big guy! Hey, fuck you! Fuck you, buddy! Fucking look at me!” Still nothing. I begin slapping the barrier, arms extended over my head. Still shouting for someone to help me. Then it happens. They start to notice me. Oh, thank God! First it’s a second glance, then this kid, probably around fifteen or so, stops. He pulls out his phone and starts recording a video of me. Seriously?


   “Hey kid. Why don’t you give me a hand getting out of here. Maybe when your done making your GOD DAMN VIDEO!” I’m really slamming on the barrier now. Slapping against it as hard as I can. Putting the full weight of my 215 pounds into it. The kid grins this delighted, goofy ass smile and gives me a thumbs up. Behind him, a middle aged blonde lady is walking her little rat dog. She notices, stops to watch for a moment, digs into her purse, then walks over and drops a fiver into my overturned hat! “Hey! No! No! That’s not what I need! Can you call someone? Maybe 911. Get the fire department over here. I need help out of this thing!” I loudly explain. An otherwise delightful grin spreads across her face and she laughs, walking away. Enraged, I yell after her, “I hope someone runs over your little rat!” 


   For hours it goes on like this. Snot is running down my face.  I’m openly weeping to silent applause from the occasional multitude of onlookers. About thirty minutes into my panic induced attempt at freedom, I had realized that I couldn’t hear anything other than the sounds I was making inside my prison. Nothing from the outside reached my ears. I can only assume that they cannot hear me either. I’m so tired. I’m tired from kicking and punching for hours. From jumping and yelling and screaming. I feel broken. 


   Now the crowd is gone. No longer do they walk past me or stare at me. I sit here all alone, slumped against the nothing which imprisons me, staring out into the cold and empty night. I am surrounded by desolation and hopelessness. Now what? Is this it? Is this how I die? From dehydration and embarrassment? “Oh God,” I snivel aloud, “Now what?” as fresh tears streak my face. Motion catches my attention. Someone is approaching from the street. It’s a kid. A little girl actually. She can’t be any older than seven or eight years. She definitely shouldn’t be out on the streets by herself at this hour. I’m not positive, but it has to be getting close to midnight or so. As the child comes closer, I can see that she is filthy. Her once blonde hair is crusty and matted with brownish clumps. Her worn clothing is torn and dirty. She has no shoes. But most disturbingly, she grips in her two hands the largest rat that I’ve ever seen. It’s kicking and swaying its body back and forth in an attempt to free itself from its captor. The girl doesn’t seem to notice when the rat sinks its long teeth into her thumb. She simply stares at me, ignoring the bite as she has so obviously ignored the others. Small tendrils of flesh are folded back to reveal the tendons and bone of her hands. But she just stares at me with her empty black eyes. The closer the girls gets, the more I can see that this is no girl. This is an abomination! Its rib bones are visible beneath torn layers of gangrenous flesh. The missing shoes have taken with them the skin and the meat of this vile creature’s calves and feet. 


   “God?” she whispers while still approaching, and I can hear her even though she’s not in my box with me. She is outside the box, right!? Grasped in the clutches of sheer horror, I push myself to the back of my cage. There is a foul, unholy essence oozing forth from the child. It repulses me and fills me with dread. My bladder releases, and I feel the warmth spread outward from my crotch. This is the true fear. It is the fear which I have never known. This fear dwarfs the worst nightmare I’ve ever had, or that I could ever conceive. This fear; it is Death come for me. The last thing that I hear rolls forth like a thunderstorm. From all around me, I feel physically and spiritually crushed by her bellowing, apocalyptic words, “God isn’t here!” I am torn into a thousand pieces, then reconstructed over and over again. Each time, this takes slightly longer than the last, until my destruction is repeated in slow motion. Agonizing hours, then days, years, even centuries roll by. I am nothing other than pain. I cannot scream for release. I cannot weep or vomit. My very existence is agony. Eventually, it is done. I am no more. My pain is complete.


   “God, I’m cold. So cold.” This is the first thought that creeps into my mind as I begin the seemingly eternal crawl towards consciousness. The second, is.... “Wait! This seems so familiar.” I quickly push myself to a seated position. My… my everything hurts! My back and shoulder are killing me. And this throbbing ache in my head prevents me from looking around too quickly. I feel the incredible urge to vomit, but I hold it at bay. I reach out towards the sidewalk before me. My hand is stopped mid air. There it is. My memory returns in a flood. I press my weight against the barrier as I desperately struggle to gain my feet. Looking through the storefront window, I see Bryan diligently stocking away. In shock, I turn myself about to face the people bustling by. No! Nononono! Not again. I won’t do this again even if it kills me. If I have to bash myself into a pulp against these walls, then that’s what I’ll do. And so I begin. My screams don’t last very long, for soon I am unable to make a sound. I’ve destroyed my voice and now the only noise coming forth is a wet wheezing. Blood streams down my face from what must be a massive gash on my forehead. I am covered in it; covered in cold, sticky blood, like the walls around me and the ground upon which I stand. My hands are so badly damaged that jagged bones protrude from the skin in several places. They are  nearly unusable, but I can push through the pain. I can push past it, because pain, to me, has become an old acquaintance. A familiar face that I know I can rely on. Pain keeps me tethered to this life of mine.

   With this in mind, I return my attention to this beat up old iPhone. I no longer have cell service, but WiFi access is everywhere these days; especially when passwords are so commonly posted on restroom walls. Looks like “▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇” still works. I don’t have much of a charge left though, and my prison doesn’t exactly come with electricity. Hunched over in the corner of my cell, I write this message to you. You are my last hope to be free from this curse. These people; they still stop to watch. They take their videos. They point, laugh, and applaud. They still drop their money into my hat. But they do not offer any help. 

   Oh please, won’t you help me!? Someone? Anyone? For the love of God, please help!

My wife Rebecca is slightly eccentric and I knew this when I married her. At the time, those little eccentricities of hers were adorable and she joked that they came with the territory of her being an artist. 

For instance, she was always barefoot even in the cold of winter. She said that shoes constrained her. She liked to collect bird feeders and grow a plethora of her own vegetables. This would be fine had she not been living in an apartment. She had fresh herbs growing on her kitchen window sill, she was growing nightshade and mugwort inside her living room and a tomato plant and small lemon tree lived in the bedroom. She also loved collecting old medical books, some of which were very rare but you can imagine how heavy these were to cart to our brand new house after we moved in together.

We have been married for five years now. She’s estranged from her family but my wife had dozens of friends, all as strange and lovely as her, every single one an artist of some sort.

Our marriage has worked because we are opposites. Where I’m meticulous tidy and a little boring as a chartered accountant, she’s untidy but highly colourful as a person. Rebecca is also the most beautiful woman I have ever seen, magazine covers included. Long flowing dark hair to her waist, big brown eyes and high cheekbones. The thing I love most about her though is her innate goodness. She has a kind word for everyone and is naturally a very sweet natured person. I know I lucked out big time with her and we have been blissfully happy in our little house where she paints portraits for a loyal customer base and I run my small business as an accountant. 

Things would continue to be blissfully happy even now had she not started working on this sudden and strange new project. 

It started three months ago. We were about to go to bed when I noticed the flash of gold on her wrist. Rebecca doesn’t wear jewellery usually as she says it gets in the way of her painting and I thought it was strange that she was wearing a bracelet.

“What’s that?” I asked, genuinely interested as she brushed her long hair out at her mirror as she did every night, the thin gold bracelet glittering as her hand moved. She turned to look at me, her brows furrowed slightly. “What is what?”

I pointed at the bracelet and she looked at her arm.

“Oh! Yes, this. I’m painting a new client and she just gave it to me. Isn’t it nice?” Rebecca smiled and raised it so I could see it better.

It was more than nice. It was expensive. It looked like a Tiffany’s bracelet. I chose my next words very carefully, “is this client a good friend too?”

She shook her head, “First timer. She said it would make her feel better if I took it as it would establish a more personal bond than client and painter.”

I must have frowned at this because she added “It’s really not odd for clients to give me presents or for me to give them little presents too. I spend hours and days painting them and it establishes a sort of camaraderie.” 

It was true she had both received and given gifts but they were more bottles of wine, plants and chocolates, never jewellery.

 But it was late and we both had an early start tomorrow. I simply nodded and decided to let it go.

The next day as we were eating dinner I noticed the silver bangle on her other arm. I put my forkful of rice and chicken into my mouth as I watched the bangle glitter. “Another gift from your client?” I asked as I chewed away.

She looked up at me and for a second I thought I saw something flit across her face. A strange expression I had never seen before. She nodded and kept eating, changing the subject to an exhibition she was hoping to go into the city and see with a friend.

I am not a jealous man. I love and trust my wife implicitly. But the fact that she was getting jewellery from an unknown person was unnerving me.

“Can I meet this client of yours?” I asked her, trying to keep my tone conversational.

It mustn’t have been conversational enough because I’ve never seen my wife’s mood change so fast. “Absolutely not, Jackson. I don’t ask to meet your clients do I?” Her words were harsh and frustrated and so unlike her.

“My clients don’t give me expensive jewellery as presents.” I retorted before I could stop myself.

I could see the colour rising in her cheeks at this. “I’m working on a brand new series of portraits and it’s going to be my best work yet. I would appreciate that you to support me through this instead of trying to intrude. I’ve already had interest from the National Gallery.”

Now this was all news to me. Rebecca always shared her work and her ideas with me, it was unlike her to be secretive. I immediately pushed aside my misgivings about the jewellery and nodded in contrition. “Of course you have my support. Always. I’m so proud you’ve got the National Gallery interested in your work! We should go out and celebrate!” 

I saw her melt slowly at this, a hesitant smile replacing the anger on her face.  She took a sip of her wine “It’s only interest as of yet, I don’t know it they’ll take the paintings.”

This was where I should have pressed her about the project, but I didn’t. And god help me I regret it deeply.

The jewellery kept accumulating and my wife’s arms were covered in expensive bracelets soon. And Rebecca began to change too. She’d spend late hours inside her studio. I rarely saw her for meals. Some nights, she didn’t even come to bed. And when I did see her, she’d be muttering to herself, words that I couldn’t quite make out. One day I saw her staring out of the kitchen window, as though in a daze, staring off into the distance. Another day I caught her doing this to a wall.

Four days ago, I couldn’t take it anymore. I needed to see what this was and why it was consuming her. Rebecca didn’t like me in her studio. It was her sacred space and for our entire marriage I had respected it. 

That night I waited until she had finally fallen asleep after three days of working non stop in her studio. Knowing she was out cold in our bed from exhaustion, I quietly walked outside the house into the garden to the studio I had built for her as our first anniversary gift.

It was massive white gazebo which had huge windows for natural light and summer breeze but was also insulated for winter. But she had been keeping the curtains closed lately which further confused me as Rebecca loved working with natural light. She had a sofa and an arm chair in there for her clients, lots of book shelves with books on art, her plants and of course her easel and art supplies. I slowly placed the key into the shed door and turned it.

The door creaked open slowly and I put my phone’s flashlight on. I didn’t want to risk putting the lights on in here.

As I raised my foot and stepped in, I grimaced at the sound of the creak. Quickly I turned to look at the house to make sure our bedroom light was still off. It was. Breathing a small sigh of relief, I moved in and shut the door behind me. 

The first thing I noticed was the smell. It smelled like rotten meat. 

Slowly, I gleamed the light into the room. I saw a series of large paintings already framed in gold, ornate frames in the corner. I moved forward to take a closer look at them and-

Tripped over hard. 

My phone fell with a clatter onto the floor and I tumbled onto the floor with a thud. Wincing at the loud sound, I groaned in pain and fumbled around looking for my phone. When I got it in my hand, I rose and shone it in the direction of what had tripped me up-

A severed head, still bleeding. 

I muffled a cry when I saw it and staggered backwards and in doing so the light lit up the floor. What met my eyes was a horrific sight. Strewn across the floor were more severed heads, limbs, torsos. Everything was so cleanly severed, as though a surgeon had done it. In my horror I also noticed that the eyes of every single head was wide open, and each face has been perfectly made up. The hair was perfect too. The expressions were all set in various forms of anguish and sorrow, as though frozen in their moment of death and decapitation. 

In a trance, I walked over to the paintings to look at what my wife had painted. She had left them facing the wall, as though hiding their contents from the world. 

Trembling, I pulled the first one and lay it against the wall facing outward so I could look at it.

And retched. 

It was a woman’s severed head on a plate, held by her own decapitated body. I was about the leave that hideous studio and run when I noticed it. On the wrist of the decapitated woman in the painting was the first bracelet I saw my wife wearing. 

Waves to nausea and fury took over me as I finally completely recognised what was happening.

My wife was a serial killer. Those bracelets were her…her momentos.

Unable to stay a second longer, I ran out of the studio, straight into the bathroom and threw up.

This was four days ago.

Today, I was sitting at the table watching my wife wash the dishes, the bracelets jingling on her arm like a series of quiet death knells. I hadn’t been able to sleep or eat since I learned of what was in that studio, what she was doing. I never turn my back when she is around, only watch her carefully.

I’ve been debating going to the police but I’m afraid of what she might do. What she is willing to do to finish this project. 

Fear has taken over my once blissful life. 

But nothing made my blood run cold more than what she said to me this morning.

This morning as she placed my coffee before me she said “Darling, I’ve just realised, I’ve never painted you.” She smiled an odd smile as she sipped her coffee looking into my eyes. “I should paint you soon.”

I think she knows.

What am I going to do?

When I was six years old, my parents began locking me in the cupboard below the sink.  It was not punishment for anything I had done.  There was no behavior that needed correcting. They just one day decided to see what would happen if you locked a young boy in a small space.

I pounded my tiny fists against the doors.  I cried, I peed.  I put my eye against the keyhole and watched as they went about their business, sans me.  Finally, I started to scream.  “Why?  Why are you doing this?”

My mother slowly walked toward the cupboard, knelt down so her eye was at the keyhole, and said simply, “Why not?”

They did this for many years.  There was never any warning.  I would be eating breakfast, anticipating the walk to school, when suddenly one of them would grab me by the arm and haul me into the cupboard.  I fought at first, but it was pointless.  They were bigger than me.  My resistance did nothing.

Sometimes it was thirty minutes.  Other times, I could be inside for half a day.  I don’t know if they forgot about me or had some sick pleasure in making me wait.  The longest I was ever inside was an entire weekend.  They went out of town.  When they came back I was nearly dead.  It didn’t seem to bother them at all.

As I grew older it became more and more uncomfortable in the small cupboard.  The smell of cleaning supplies would make me lightheaded.  The mold and everyday decay would stick to my clothes and hair.  It was an odd prison.  Dark, but quiet.  The only light came in through the keyhole, which I watched like a sentry.  

To be honest, I got used to it.  It became normal.  Almost comforting.  I was able to watch my family as if I was not one of them.  I could clearly see the kitchen table, where my mother would sort the mail.  A little further on I could see the front door and a bit of the sofa.  My father came in and out, the same hat everyday.  I began to know them intimately.  Perhaps they wanted me to disappear.  But by locking me inside they made me even more real.

Abruptly one day they stopped.  Maybe it was because I was too big, or maybe because they had lost interest.  But I went a full week without a session in the cupboard.  I was twelve.  After two weeks I came to my father.  “Why aren’t you putting me in the cupboard anymore?”

He didn’t look up from his coffee.  “Why not?”

I write this only to explain how I became a voyeur.  You see, after six or so years of being confined to a cage, you cannot help but find something to love about it.  I knew what it was like to be truly alone.  Yet a large part of me yearned for the outside world.  It was a contradiction - I wanted to be confined free at the same time.  So confinement became my freedom.

I hid in every space I could fit, as long as it had a hole to see out of.  I stopped going to school.  I wore clothing that covered me up completely except for my eyes.  I wanted to see, not be seen.  As usual, my family did not notice.  I was a prop to walk around.  

Finding new places to hide in the house was crucial.  I turned to closets, behind doors, under beds.  No one went looking for me.  My favorite spot was a shelf in my parents’ room.  It was up high and had a small door to close.  I fit inside even as a seventeen year old.  My knees to my chest, I would stay up there all day until they fell asleep.  I was an owl.  Silent.  Perched.

Years passed slowly inside small spaces.  One day I was up on the shelf, enjoying being enclosed.  My mother walked into the bedroom.  I remember she wore plain blue jeans and a white blouse.  My father followed her in the same hat he wore everyday.  Neither displayed any specific emotion.  

I noticed the gun in my father’s hand.  It wasn’t strange, he carried guns often.  But without warning he lifted it and fired at my mother.  She turned around, bored.  He had missed.

She held her hand out and he gave the gun to her.  I was pressed as close I could get to the small opening.  I could hear my heart beating in my ears.  I knew my parents were strange, but nothing like this.

My mother inspected the gun for a moment before pointing it at my father.  Her shot found its mark in his forehead.  He fell back like a bowling pin.  I let out a small yelp.  She looked up at me, blank-faced.  Quietly, I slipped out of the shelf and stood in front of her, shaking.

“Why did you shoot him?” I asked, choking back fear.

Her words came as no surprise to me.  “Why not?”  She held the gun out, dangling it from her pointer finger.  Terrified I held up my hands and she dropped it onto my open palms.

“I can’t,” I whispered.

“Why not?” I looked at her.  There was no life behind her eyes.  No love, no sympathy.

I raised the gun.  When I pulled the trigger my entire body exploded with the kickback.  I stumbled onto the bed, unsure if I had even hit her.  

My mother remained standing for a moment, a hole where her left eye had been.  Then like a doll she crumpled to the floor.  She and my father bled a dark black fluid onto the carpet.

I thought about hiding in my usual spots, but it didn’t feel right.  The whole point was to observe.  I couldn’t watch what was not living.  So I gathered up some things, clothes, and my parents’ money.  I knew I had to find new spots in other people’s homes.  I took the gun too...maybe as a momento.

As I opened the front door I heard noises from the bedroom.  It was my parents, rising from their deathbeds.  But I couldn’t look back, even if their voices begged me to return.  They said they were finally free.  They would love me now.  But I shut the door to their wails.  This would be a new chapter for me.

A brand new life.

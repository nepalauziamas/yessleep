Im sitting on my loungroom couch as my eyes roll into soft, meaningful tears. As the person on the phone tells me that my father has just passed away, my memories fill my brain as the thought of loss kicks in. In a depreesed state of conciousness, i roll into the fetal position as i hang up the phone with a regretful anger, and all i could do was go to sleep, nothing else, theres nothing else you can do once you find out one of your most fond parents passes away.

They say he died of a heart attack, he was just lying down on his bed and suddenly just died, its weird how that happens? Just a few weeks later i have moved into the place where my father lived, since it was on his will i have this place all to myself with every single belonging of his still sitting inside that damn property of his. This place gave me nightmares and for a good reason. I know this place has a dark secret. And for a 28 year old to be scared of something wasnt really normal, but this place, this darn place is going to have some issues.

As i sit down on the fancy rocking chair my dad always sat on, something catches my eyesight, it was a box?
Obviously for someone who wants drama, i open the box which was laying just above the fridge, honestly it looked like it was dragging me towards it because of its some sort of evil look. It was those keys? The keys from over a decade ago, them keys that was some of the reason to give me nightmares. I pick up the keys to inspect them properly. It was a mix of little keys and big keys and one singular car key, it wasnt a modern car key, it looked like a really really old car key, like a key that belonged to a car from the 1950's

I look at what seems to be a small engraving on the car key, it looked like eagle wings but they looked really large to be eagle wings, the engraver mustve done a sh*t job trying to do an eagle representation. I put the keys in my pocket and head outside, jump in my car and head to the nearest mall where an antique collector was located. I open the very dusty looking door, looking like it hadnt been opened for months. The store receptionist greets me with a very polite tone, i make a small smile to that because i have never heard anyone that polite before. "Hello" i say to the receptionist, "i have this old looking set of keys, mind if you have a look?" I ask. The receptionist nods with a smile. He pulls up a magnifying glass and begins to look at the keys. 

I turn around to have a look at all of the antiques, but was quickly inturupted when the receptionist tells me the car keys belong to a 1950 ford. "That was quick?" I say to the receptionist. The receptionists nods and points to the marking on the keys, "you live on that property of your dads dont you?" He says staring straight at me with a blank face, i nod. He doesnt say a word until i go to turn around, i was feeling really creeped out by this guy at this point. I go to leave but was inturupted again when he says "that place is the meaning of damn hell, if you dont leave you will turn out just like your father" he says in a rough voice, i could tell he was meaning it but i grab the keys from the counter and run out of there.

When i get back to the property, i want to take a nice relaxing walk where the treeline sat. As im walking i get the feeling of something watching me, and it got to the point where i full on stopped infront of the treeline. As im standing there i hear a slow muffled voice come from the middle of the forest, it was really quiet and discrete. Thats when i noticed it was really silent, the memory of the night when i was 14 comes back to me. I want to run but i cant, im stuck in the exact spot. When the voice became to loud to comprehend, i snap out of my trans and all of the noises came back, insects were croaking and birds were chirpimg again. I didnt want to but it was pulling me in, the forest called to me, so i answered. I was walking in the forest and about 100 metres into it, i seen a car? It was a old ford, the same model the receptionist told me about.

I observe the car, it has been rusted into pure dust and its wheels were no where to be seen but the key hole was shiny as a chrome plated sliver spoon. All i could do was use the keys in the car, as i sat on the leather seats i bend down and put the keys into the car and i feel this awful sense of dread when i do so. Something grabs my shoulder and i flinch back out of the car but nothing was there, i run back to the house, with every tree seeming like it wants to kill me and the ground now shaking like a car starting, tears run down my face because i have never been so scared in my life. When i run out of the treeline, everything stops.

The only thing i notice is nothing was on the property anymore, no house, no car in the driveway and no shed. Thats when a thunderous crash comes from where the house was suppost to be, it was a plane, a damn world war 2 plane came crashing down on the property, as soon as it crashes, everything shifts, it was like a timelapse of time going past. The house was now built but it was really new, like it had just been built. It was night time and i seen a couple standing on the portch of the house, then something runs from the left of the house, it was this unhumanly long creature with really long arms that thrust itself towards the couple. 

The image of blood and guts being squirted everywhere fills my mind. And i see the man gets into the same car that was in the forest, ive never seen a car so new before. He starts the car up but the creature jumps onto the car and violently tries to grab the man, it succeeds, and the car goes running straight into the forest, but it wasnt a forest, it was just grass and the car gets stopped by the creature and it visciously tears apart the man. Time changes again and i feel different, im in the treeline and i see... myself? "I" was sitting on the portch with my dog and i had keys in my hand, i was holding them up but i couldnt feel anything, i couldnt control it. The thing that was in me made a quick turn as the dog next to "me" started barking, i hang up the keys on a branch and i run to the car.

I jumped underneath the car, and underneath the car was this hole, it lead down to a huge connection of tunnels that looked like they stretched on for miles. Thats when i snap back into present time. I lay on the ground and start to cry, but i remember this place isnt safe anymore, im not safe anymore, i run to the house where i barge through the front door, i get my hand up above the door and grabs my dads shotgun, i face towards the treeline and see the monster again, its smiling. I put the shotgun up to my head and in one last moment i see the monster hold up those damn keys again, i cant deal with this anymore, i could hear the monster talk to me as if he was saying to "do it".

I wake up, the hostpital lights flicker and the soft white pillow comforts my head. "Hes awake!" One of the nurses yell. Everyone comes and and stares at me with an exciting smile. "What... happened?" I say in a slow tone. "You were in a coma" one of the people from the crowd says. "You crashed your plane sir, you are so licky you survived!" Another person says. I blink, confused, i try to get up but thats when i notice it wasnt... "what date is it?!" I scream. One of the men point at the calendar and says "21st of may 1949, we won the war!". I start to panick, shock runs through my entire nervous system, this... this cant be...

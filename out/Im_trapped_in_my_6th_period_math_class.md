I'm trapped in my 6th period math class. Now I know this sounds crazy but this is the 10th iteration and we're going crazy, my phone seems to not reset so hopefully I can get this story out there to somebody. 

I walked in the first time and everything was normal, took my seat and the teacher walked in, closed the door and was teaching for the hour and a half until the bell rang for it to end. And then… as I got up I was suddenly back in my seat, bell rings for the start of class and- the teacher… he hadn't left… What the hell? He walks in the door. Everyone in class seems confused and the teacher also looks confused on what the hell just happened. Good. I'm not crazy. 

Everyone is so confused and the teacher tries to open the door. Nothing. It… It wouldn't open. Now everyone was a little anxious and a whole lot confused but we talked about it. Now so far this has happened 10 times and we're discussing ways to get out. There's a short period of which when the teacher walks in (almost in like a zombie state until the door closes) that we might be able to get out of so we're going to try that next.

Edit: We tried to put a chair in front of it first to see if we could keep it open and the chair was crushed into pieces instantly so needles to say? Nada. We're about to be res

Sorry we were reset. I'm going to talk with the others and- what the fuck. The door is a dark brown instead of the normal light brown. What the fuck. What the fuck. Now we're really freaking out. It's a small insignificant detail, yes. But that's not right! THAT'S NOT CORRECT WHAT'S GOING ON!? 

Edit 2: We're on the 15th iteration now and there's small differences like colors changing. A few of us purposely cut ourselves and when it reset it was instantly gone. We've had a horrible idea but… We need to know what's going on. 

Edit 3: its been 10 minutes since edit 2. We killed the class pet, the hamster. Now we wait

Edit 4: It's alive and seems to have no memory of dying. There's more small differences. And the worst of them all? On the whiteboard instead of saying 'good morning!' it said, nothing. There was nothing there

Edit 5: FUCK ITS REST 4 MORE TIMES AND ON THE BOARD IT SAYS "Hello :)" WHAT THE FUCK, NO. WE'RE FREAKING OUT I WANT TO BE FREE.

Edit 6: It's been a few more iterations and we are completely safe. Everything is fine. Stop reading. Goodbye!

What the hell. I DIDN'T WRITE THAT. EVERYTHING IS NOT FINE. WHAT THE HELL. THERES BLOOD ON THE BOARD. WHY IS EVERYTHING LIKE THIS. WHY IS EVERYTHING LIKE THIS. WHY IS EVERYTHING LIKE THIS. WHY IS EVERYTHING LIKE THIS. 
WHY IS EVERYTHING LIKE THIS. WHY IS EVERYTHING LIKE THIS. 
LIKE THIS. LIKE THIS. LIKE THIS. LIKE THIS.   Why the hell did it repeat. I'm turning my phone off for now. I don't know what's happening but I can't risk this.

Edit 7: We think we can escape, we found out one of the windows don't reset, it's unnaturally strong but we've put a scratch on it. Hopefully we can escape. 

Edit 8:The walls are dripping blood and we haven't gotten a crack in the window yet. I'm… I'm so scared… I'm breathing heavily, as I'm writing this I'm crying and having an anxiety attack, none of us can do anything, some have given up hope. I'm starting to give up hope myself. Godamnit I'm bawling my eyes out right now. Normally in school you act tough or you'll be made fun of but this is a special circumstance. Everyone is scared. Even the teacher who tried to hold it together for so long. 

Edit 9: It's been 5 more and we finally did it! We have a crack! The walls have changed from a brownish tan to a blood red. The dark kind of red when blood has been left to dry. I think it is blood actually. The whiteboard says in fresh blood "No escape. :)" And I'm losing it. I don't know what is going on but we got a small crack! This is groundbreaking! We're all just celebrating for now! This is big for us! This could be a way out of this nightmarish hell! It could also be even worse than this hell but… No. We're going to stay positive! 

Edit 10: I can't remember how long it's been but the windows crack is growing a tiny bit! But… The whiteboard is now saying "You will all die here. You will never escape." In blood. And- wait hold on somethings happening

Edit 11: It's uh… Been like… 20 minutes.. Uh… I can't do this anymore. A kid started coughing up blood and then they were flung to the ground and held their- more and more blood trying to escape their throat, their lungs, their everything. They… They died. And… And… And… THEY FUCKING DIED. THEY CHOKED TO DEATH ON THEIR OWN FUCKING BLOOD, CONVULSING, TRYING TO BREATHE. WE TRIED TO HELP BUT ITS LIKE THEY WEIGHED A THOUSAND POUNDS WE COULDN'T  GET THEM UP. I'M GOING FUCKING INSANE NO! I CAN'T DO THIS. WE'RE ALL SCARED. WE JUST WANT THIS HELL TO BE OVER.

Edit 12: It's been another reset. The kids body didn't reset. He didn't reset. He's… He's dead dead… Fuck. I- the window. NO FUCK. THE WINDOW IS FIXED. NO.

Edit 13: The room is changing more. We're back to square one on the window. And somebody died. Their body is just sitting there. Decomposing at a very fast rate. Its only been 10 minutes and the room reaks of rotting corpse. I've already barfed multiple times. And now theres a face appearing against the

Edjt 14: Yay. A scratch. Who's to say that means anything. I'm scared. I'm tired. And honestly? Pretty defeated. Most have given up. Even the teacher. Honestly, who cares.

text is appearing and at this point i'm done deleting it. Hopefully it stops. We're trying to break the window but we honestly have given up hope. At least we aren't alone. We have each other and that's something I guess. Time for another fucking reset. I hate that goddamn bell. It's pitch is constantly changing. Getting more and more creepy.

Edit 15: Fuck. The wall face? It's talking in this high pitched clown like voice. It's staring at us. Telling us we're all gonna die and laughing maniacally. I tried to beat it with a chair but the chair bounced off. It took no notice of it happening.

Edit 16: Some cracks are forming. And uh… The face is gone… But before it left it looked at somebody and said "you're next!~" laughing it's terrifying laugh.

Edit 17: Fuck. It's been one reset since 16 and the person it said that to fucking exploded. Their blood, intestines and guts flew everywhere. And in place of the wall head? Their face, now a bloody mess is just sitting on a desk. We can't move it. I'm about to kill myself to end this I swear to fucking god. I'm so H̶͚̭͙̳̄́͌͊͑̊̆͆͒̋͝͝ä̶̢̛͕̦̘̗͙̹̯͇̦̣͔̘́́̌̅͗̄̔̚͠͝ͅp̷͎̖̩̯̳̰̖͐͗́̀̈́̅̒̈́̏̾́͜͝p̶̡̧̳̜̻̹͙̜̝̳̟̬̣̹̮̯̩͆̚ỳ̴̛̻͖̖͎̖͔̄̽͋̅́́͂͘ scared. 

Edit 18: The window is finally starting to break a bit. But I'm not getting my hopes up, last time it fixed itself after we were hopeful. This isn't hell. No hell is beautiful compared to this. This? This is something far far worse. And the body is disgusting now, the guts are disgusting, and now the skin is falling off the skull of that head. This is horrifying. Beyond anything I could make up.

Edit 19: The teacher… He's… He's dead. He also died. This time the most horrific death. Because it was suffering. You could see the suffering. Hear the suffering. And couldn't turn away. He combust into flames and was melting. He was screaming in pain and agony. THOSE FUCKING SCREAMS WILL HAUNT ME FOREVER. FUCK. And the worst part? We couldn't turn away- we were physically unable to turn away or close our eyes. We were forced to watch. To watch and listen. The window is so close too breaking though  

Edit 20: We've been here for so long… So many resets since my last edit… The window fixed itself right before it was about to break and now The window is about to break again- It just shattered! I JUST SAW IT SHATTER! YES!!! And- WAIT- WHAT THE FUCK!? EVERYONE IS GONE!! I'm- I'm going to go through the window-

Edit 21. Last edit: It's been a year. When I stepped out of the window I was met with the real world. Everyone else was gone. Nobody seemed to notice that time had passed… I guess it hadn't, we were in there for a year or two but I'm no older than when it first reset… But the sky is a purple color. People are acting differently. Things are… Out of place… I'm not sure that I even escaped that hell… I… I might still be there… I'm going to kill myself. I can't take this anymore. If I'm still stuck then who knows if this is even actually going to the real world… I'm… I'm probably gonna end my life tonight… If anyone sees this then do yourself a favor. If you ever get trapped in a loop like this. End your life early. There's no true escape. If you get back to the real world you will forever be stuck there mentally. Nobody will believe you. Please… Just make it quick and painless for yourself.

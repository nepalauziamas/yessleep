If you’re a girl interested in girls you’ve been there: you see a hot chick on Tinder and then you read her bio and it says “in an open relationship” or “polyamorous” or “looking for a MFF threesome” or some shit like that. Fuck.

But then there’s the ones that sneak up on ya. I matched with a fun-loving-appearing woman just a few years older than myself. She was a hairstylist from Europe with a labradoodle. It was only after a few days of messaging that she finally revealed her agenda: she had a boyfriend and they were looking for a one-off third. My heart sunk. It was already hard enough for me to accept my burgeoning lesbianism, but then this spanner gets thrown in the works just as I’m starting to connect to a girl.

Foolishly, I let myself get talked into meeting them. I had not yet had a sexual experience with another woman and Eve said I wouldn’t even have to touch Adam (fake names, clearly) because she’d be in the middle and he mainly wanted to watch. I feel stupid now and it’s still something I’m beating myself up over. This already had so many red flags.

Picture in the mind’s eye what a young white couple looking for a threesome look like. I can guarantee you know what these two look like. A hot girl with a Charles-Manson-looking guy. He even had those manic eyes. I had agreed to come to their place (I know please don’t comment about how stupid I was) because it was in an apartment in a good part of town. It sounded pretty safe because, I mean, they  had neighbours and there was a Pete’s Coffee right on the ground floor. It’s downtown, people would be around if I started to scream.

Adam had a manic look in his eyes that immediately put me on the defensive. Meth, ecstasy? Some sort of upper, that’s for sure. He spent tediously long time explaining to me how monogamy was bad for women and I had to sit there with the typical womanly smile-and-nod routine while this guy popped off about gender politics. Brother, I’m just here to eat your girl out!

Weed got involved (again, leave me be) and I hit a few rips on their Frankenstein head bong. I thought it would help me loosen up to get prepped for a threesome. I didn’t realise it was to throw me off guard. Eve was scooting closer to me on the couch, caressing my inner thigh. I was starting to relax into her touch, thinking that maybe this wouldn’t be so bad.

Your brain can’t even process what’s happening when you get hit over the head with an iron pole. There were no thoughts in my head as I hit the floor, my brain was just trying to frantically re-assess the situation and figure out who was attacking me. I got a gargled whine before the second blow hit. I can’t say much about what happened next because of the concussion. I know that Adam and Eve were arguing, but I can’t remember any of their words. I think Eve was worried he’d killed me—that would spoil their plan.

I came-to in a cold basement. It took my brain some time to realise what had happened. It all felt like a dream, and I still didn’t register who had done this to me until Adam and Eve came through the old wooden door. I tried to stand, but my head hurt far too much and I stumbled back down, then realising my right hand was cuffed to a pipe. I was in my bra and underwear. Now I I knew how serious this was. 

“Guys,” I mumbled, jaw hurting surprisingly more than I had known, “what’s happening?”

“Be a good little girl and we’ll let you go back to your mommy and daddy,” Adam growled, eliciting a horror little giggle from Eve.

These two fuckers thought they were the Joker and Harley Quinn I swear to God.

Look, I’m not going to go into details about what they did to me. You don’t want to hear it and I don’t want to repeat it. It’s only worth mentioning that a metal spatula and cooking blowtorch were involved. Eve would torture me with the implements while Adam masturbated or she would masturbate him as he tortured me. This wasn’t a threesome. It was a demented couple and I was their living doll. I still cringe when I think about the way they spoke to each other in a baby language while pressing a hot spatula onto the bottom of my feet.

I’ve been told this went on for three days,  but with my concussion it felt much shorter (thankfully). All the while I remained handcuffed to the pole except when they took me upstairs (blindfolded) to shower and use the toilet. I was planning my escape, as best as my scattered brain could in the circumstances. I knew this was going to result in death if I didn’t do something. These two had no plans to let me go home.

The one thing in my favour was that the door to the basement couldn’t lock. It had some big old ancient skeleton key lock and I’d never heard or seen them locking it—probably didn’t have the key anymore. If I could get out of the handcuff I could get out. I’ve seen Gerald’s Game. I knew what it would take. 

It’s hard to convince your brain to endure pain to reap the benefits later, pumping myself up to do what had to be done took some time. I waited until what appeared to be night (just based on their absence from the basement) before I shakily stood up and started to pull myself away from the pipe. I was trying to not make too much noise, but it was hard not to gasp in pain as I tried to rip my hand out through the tight handcuff. I had to stop twice, the second time I was already bleeding, having partially split the base of my palm open. I made the wise decision to use my toe to scoot my previously discarded, bloodied, underwear towards me. I probably looked insane shoving it in my mouth—self gag to muffle the screaming.

It took breaking my thumb and partially degloving my hand to get out of the cuff. I rank that as the most painful experience of my life, above any torture those two put me through. I stood there for a second once it was done, trembling violently and watching an endless drip of blood splat on the floor. I had a nosebleed from stress and a bloodied hand. Maybe I was going to go into shock soon. I had to go now or I would faint before I could get any further.

Carefully opening the basement door, I saw to my horror what they had planned to come next. A hacksaw, black plastic bags, bleach, and gloves were all sitting on the workbench just before the staircase. I had to stop from crying aloud with fear. The iron pole was also sitting there. Foolishly, I tried to lift it with my good hand. I had no strength to lift it with my non-dominant hand and it thudded back onto the table. I stayed dead still, wondering if anyone would come through the door at the top of the staircase and discover me. After a minute of no response, just the soft thump of hip hop music playing in another room, I grabbed the hacksaw. Not an ideal weapon but the best I had.

Eve was in the living room taking a rip from the Frankenstein head. This wasn’t the same apartment I had met them in. This house was far older, and on the ground floor. There was graffiti on the walls and torn wallpaper, broken floorboards. Maybe some sort of crackhouse.

My first instinct should’ve been to sneak to the exit, but my primal desire was to slam the hacksaw blade into the back of Eve’s skull. A mistake, for sure, as she heard the creaking wood and spun around on the couch to see me. Screaming, she flung the plastic bong at me on first instinct. It didn’t even phase me, the adrenaline kicked in and I went at her, even with my left hand swinging the blade it still did some damage. Eve fought back hard and we ended up tussling on the ground, both trying to gain control of the blade. Kanye glaring in the background made the whole situation even more absurd. 

Eve got ahold of the hacksaw and I’ve got nasty defensive wounds on my arms to prove it, but what she didn’t see coming was me grabbing her mortar from the coffee table and slamming into the side of her skull. I took multiple hits to the head with a pipe and lived, she took one hit with a mortar and died. The brain is a delicate thing.

Adam hadn’t been there. I still don’t know where he had been at the time, but the stars aligned for me to get out of there. The house was situated in a neighbourhood I didn’t recognise, but most the places looked derelict. I sobbed as I walked down the street looking for a inhabited property. I was thinking I had made it out of there only to die on the street because I couldn’t find help.

Normally I wouldn’t wave down a low-riding car blaring trap music, but desperate times called for desperate measures. And, as Tinder had taught me, don’t judge a book by its cover.

“Holy shit, girl, the fuck happened to you?”the passenger asked, stepping out the car after turning off the music.

I cannot express how grateful I am to those two men who stopped to help me. Here I was, a naked woman bleeding and bruised, walking down the road, and they immediately got me in the back seat and headed for the ER. One laid his jacket over me while the other used his Laker’s shirt to wrap around my bleeding hand. I fell onto unconscious in the backseat as the engine roared, I was fully spent. I wish I had managed to stay awake because when two black men showed up to the hospital with a naked white girl unconscious in the back the cops were called and they were arrested. It wasn’t until I came-to and told the police what happened that those poor guys got released. No good deed goes unpunished. They didn’t even get an apology or acknowledgment that they saved my life. But they’re good enough guys to testify at the trial.

Adam was eventually tracked down. Unsurprisingly, that Tinder profile was deleted but once they identified Eve’s corpse they linked him to her. He was picked up eight hours away at a motel when they found his car. The tech sweep revealed the creepy messages between the two, including the rape roleplay, snuff films, and a ghastly collection daddy and kitten exchanges. I was their first victim, but, had they not been stopped, I wouldn’t have been their last.

Adam’s defence is that it was consensual BDSM that went awry. He says all the bad stuff happened after he left and he’s dumping it all on Eve. What a loyal guy. My lawyer seems confident it’s not going to hold up based on my own testimony and the evidence, but this is still going to be a months, even years, long process.

Netflix has approached me for some new series their making. About lost my shit at that, but could use the money since I can’t currently work and the legal process is expensive. Maybe you’ll see my story put to dramatic music and talking heads later on.

It’s going to be hard to start dating again. I don’t think I’ve had a single good night’s sleep since what happened. My hand aches all the time and then I get sharp shocks of agony at random. I wish I had some meaningful, happy ending to put to this, but I guess the happy ending is that I lived.

I’ve gone off Tinder, as expected. Sticking to Bumble from now on.

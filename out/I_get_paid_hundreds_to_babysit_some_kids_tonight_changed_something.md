I HATE kids, never want them. I raised my sister and I’m done.

&#x200B;

But this babysitting job makes a lotta money and I can act like I like them for a couple hundred.

&#x200B;

The thing is, these rich people leave the house alone with me and their weird ass kids all night. I don’t mean weird like they chew crayons or tell me weird things. I mean they stare at walls for hours on end, only eat when I make something and NEVER TALK.

&#x200B;

The rules are fucking weird but every house has a different way of parenting so it's not too weird I guess.

&#x200B;

1: The children are not allowed in the master bedroom, do not allow them.

2: Do NOT speak to them, they do not talk.

3: Homework MUST be finished before dinner.

4: The children are allowed tv until 9 pm

5: Homework is to be started at 7:50, Dinner at 8:20 and bed at 9 unless otherwise told.

&#x200B;

I don’t question the rules, in fact I don’t have time to question the rules. We only talk before they leave and after they get back in the morning. And trust me they leave at the same time every time so I only have enough time for one simple question before and after the night.

&#x200B;

The children know when they need to be somewhere so I don’t even have to speak to them. The parents gave me the rules and answered questions before leaving, and yes they told me this from outside the property, not outside the door. Off the property. 

&#x200B;

When I first met the family it was at my old work, some high end hotel that rich people go to, to do illegal things that I’m never allowed to talk about. I would see them every weekend at EXACTLY 8 pm, they would drop their kids off and go blow off some steam I guess. I never once got a complaint from the room so I didn’t say anything. They were the most normal guests we ever had, the children were nice besides never having eye contact and never talking. They once brought me cookies on their 20th stay.

&#x200B;

Well I was fired for “misconduct” after knocking on the hotel door to check on the kids. I asked if they wanted any food because I never EVER got an order for room service and the parents didn’t bring food. The kids would be there until morning, I was getting worried. I should’ve just done what I always do and keep my head out of their business because I was fired that night. At least I got severance so that’s great.

&#x200B;

I wish I could tell you about the parents, if they were famous or secretly millionaires. I don’t know what their work is, but they work from home Monday to Friday and work around the world Saturday and Sunday. So I work Friday night, Saturday and Sunday all day and night. Meaning my usual paycheck is 1300 for three days, under the table. Talk about a dream job right? They're putting me back into school so I follow whatever they want me to do and I do not question it. I would hear whispers from neighbours, about the last ‘nanny’ who went crazy and hurt the children. But there would be some neighbours talking about the children, who were abnormal. I wouldn’t say the old nanny might be right on some but to hurt them? Damn I don’t like kids but I’m not an asshole.

&#x200B;

ANYWAYS, these fucking kids usually stare at the wall, their tablets, switches or the multiple tv’s around the house. They don’t even make noise when doing so and the electronics they use are always muted, but anyways they NEVER look at me which was weird for a while because children stare right? But today I get to the home at 7:48 on the dot like every night and this time the parents give me a note, they don’t tell me cause of the dumb rule (yes i follow a rule I KNOW is dumb it’s $600 a day) and they left. The note was folded with the instructions “open when they look at you” so I looked at the kids, and they were staring at the wall. No biggie it’s the usual so I get their homework ready and call for them.

&#x200B;

They came into the kitchen LOOKING AT ME, yeah okay little more weird than normal, whatever the fuck normal is anymore. I opened the note without saying anything and for fucks sake it says “hide at 9 pm, we will help if you need. Otherwise, good luck and you will be expecting $700 tonight.” yeah o-fucking-k I can do that for that uch f a raise. I have to have dinner being made while they do their homework and they eat from 8 to 8:30 and that gives me washing dishes time to fucking hide for i don’t know why.

&#x200B;

They haven't said anything so I can assume it’s a prank like last month when the kiddos tried to tickle me. I’m gonna text the parents and ask whether I should take it seriously or not. They don’t usually play pranks so I doubt it’s that.

&#x200B;

It’s weird, they seem to be antsy, I already want to hide. It’s been ten minutes before nine. They can’t be like this already jeez. Oh the family just got back to me hold up.

&#x200B;

Yeah, this is fucked. I have to hide and ‘protect’ myself until the stop singing. Well they're not singing now so I don’t have to worry. They never talk so why would this prank even be believable. I don’t doubt the family thought this was cute so I’ll do my best to go along with whatever the fuck is going to happen next. 

&#x200B;

This family is so fucked, but I still need the money to live..

&#x200B;

I’ll continue this post in a bit, I have to finish dishes before hell hath fury happens or what ever the fuck else.

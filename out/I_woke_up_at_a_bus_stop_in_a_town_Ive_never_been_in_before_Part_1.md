I feel I should preface this by saying that the last memories I have prior to waking up were being at my home in Portland, OR. I woke up on the bench of a bus stop with no cell service, no landmarks indicating where I am, nothing.  


But I'm getting ahead of myself, my name is Jacob. I'm 24, a college dropout and an overall uninteresting person. My job history has consisted of fast food, grocery retail and basic landscaping work. I had landed a job in Portland bussing tables for a very seedy bar for an unusually high pay of $25/hr.   


Upon waking up, my first reaction was that I'd just had too much to drink the night before. I pulled out my phone to find that I had no cell service whatsoever, which in itself isn't unusual, given the dead-zones my city can have, I figured there was just an outage or I'd woken up on the wrong side of town. But what was weirder was the bus stop, it didn't look like the usual Tri Met stops, it was an old wooden bench, with a paper schedule in a plastic container that looked as though it was used to collect rent checks at one point or another. The bench was covered by this corrugated metal covering that looked as though it hadn't seen a cleaning in over 50 years, mounted to it was a single analog clock that seemed to be ticking far too slowly.

&#x200B;

Looking just down the road about half a mile, I could see houses. Well, "houses" wouldn't be the correct term. Have you ever seen "A Cabin in the Woods"? Exactly that, they were cabins surrounded by seemingly endless trees. The vibes I got from even the consideration of going down the road were sinister at LEAST, so I decided that perhaps the bus would be a safer bet. The schedule read that the next bus would be arriving at 4:07 AM, looking at the ever-so-slowly moving clock, it read "3:59 AM".   


I go to light up a cigarette, just to make the time pass. Surely this bus will lead me to somewhere familiar. Sure, not all roads lead to Rome, but surely one of them has to lead home, right? As I'm having this train of thought, I realize that my lighter is out of fluid, I give it three or four more courtesy flicks before throwing it out of frustration.   


"Need a light?" a voice inquired behind me, nearly making me jump out of my own skin.  


"JESUS FUCK! dude, where did you come from?!" I turned to see a man wearing a black hoodie, torn blue jeans and work boots that have clearly been worn for their intended purpose. I can't quite make out the man's face, it's dark and the hood casts a shadow on what light could possibly illuminate it.  


"Oh, sorry, I'm a bit quiet. Anyways, that light?"

"oh, right, thank you!"  
I took the lighter and lit my cigarette, taking a few hasty drags to try and calm myself from the near heart attack I'd just experienced.  


"You're not from here, are you?" the man had asked  


"How can you tell?" I asked, wondering how he'd know that.  


"You got an aura about you, most folks here don't take too kindly to outsiders."  


"yeah, I'm not from here, speaking of, where is 'here' anyways? I just woke up at this bus stop"

"I'd hoped you'd have known, this is Anaira" the man had answered. Seeming almost offended that I didn't know.

"Look at it this way, you've by some ungodly happenstance just woke up on what I like to refer to as 'Hell's doorstep', it's best you find your way out, the sooner the better"

"That's the idea," I replied "I'm not super keen on sticking around here"  


"Take some advice from an old man who ended up here same as you;  
\-Don't give folks your name, make an alias and make it convincing, you don't want to know what'll happen to you if they think you're lying

\-Try to avoid talking to the locals, but if you have to, be polite, friendly even, but don't stick around too long. Make it as quick as 'hello, yes it is wonderful weather we're having, I must be going, but you have yourself a lovely day'

\-Under NO circumstances are you to enter any buildings. If you must sleep, do so at the bus stop."

&#x200B;

"That's....an odd set of rules" I replied, concerned.  


"The more I say, the more danger you're in. Look, you can call me D, I'll show you the way out, but you must follow everything I say to a T. You stray from my instructions, I will not be able to guarantee your safety"  


Alarm bells started ringing in my head. Surely this dude couldn't be serious. He makes it sound like this town is full of monsters.   


"O....kay? where does this bus lead?" a quick glance to the clock overhead showed the time as 4:00. 

"It's a loop. It'll take us closer to where we need to go, but when it reaches the end of the town, the road it travels down somehow ends up right back here, which reminds me, there are some things you need to know about the bus.

\- The driver will require a fare, it doesn't accept currency. Food, cigarettes, blood. It'll accept just about anything and it will drive you a distance it feels amounts to the value of what you pay.  


\- Do not make small talk with the driver, it will try to get information out of you and it is *uncomfortably* persuasive. 

\- Do not stand from your seat until the bus has made a complete stop, this will only serve to anger the driver, and if you're lucky, he'll just kick you off.

\- Under no circumstances should you look at it from it's overhead mirror, it will know, and you will not like what looks back at you.  


\- Don't use your phone at ALL while on the bus, time is irrelevant and the light that emanates from phones just pisses it off. "

"Okay, pal, listen. I appreciate the light, but this all sounds a little crazy. This town can't really be this...eldritch, can it?"

The man removed his hood to reveal that his face is entirely blank, save for two very rough slits in the skin where eyes should have been. It's as though he just had a sheet of skin cling-wrapped around his skull.  "it most certainly is. this is what I got for angering the driver. It stole my fucking face, ripped it clean off my god damned skull. It's '*mercy*' was carving the blank canvas that was left to leave me with some iota of sight, effectively daring me to look at it in it's mirror again."

&#x200B;

I can't lie to you. I watch a lot of horror movies, gore-filled movies and videos, LiveLeak back when that was still around, the works. But I couldn't stop myself from throwing up at the sight of it. To have something so visceral so dangerously close to me. I began to believe what he said. But with that belief came a whole slew of new questions.  


The bus has just arrived. Provided I don't get torn to pieces by breathing wrong or something, I'll update everyone. Until then, wish me luck, I guess...

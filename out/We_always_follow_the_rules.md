As long as I can remember, it’s been Tommy, Alex, Emma, and me. We live with our dad - mom left when we were young. I don’t blame her for leaving, but I wish she’d taken us with her. I’d leave too if I could, but I can’t leave the others behind with him. Most nights he comes home drunk and passes out, but some nights, he comes home drunk and angry - those are the bad ones. As the oldest, it’s my job to protect them. 

We all know the rules - don’t make noise at night, don’t leave a mess, don’t open the door if anyone comes around. And don’t - *ever* - go in the basement. He never says exactly why, but the one time he caught me heading down there, it took me two weeks to recover. 

The other night, he came home drunk and in a bad mood. 

“Charlie!”

I knew right away it was going to be a bad night; I sent my siblings to our room and told them to lock the door. 

“Yes, Dad?” I replied cautiously as I approached him.

“Who the hell was in this house?”

I looked at him, confused. I knew better than to invite anyone in. 

“What do you mean?  No one…”

“Then what the hell is *this*? He asked, shoving something in my face. I took it - it was a pamphlet I’d brought in after it was left on our doorstep. 

“Oh, this is just…”

I felt a sharp pain against my face, so hard that my vision blurred. 

“Don’t you talk back to me!”  I felt another pain against my face, then a hard impact against my side as I lay on the floor.

At this point, I knew he’d lost it, so I tried to lead him away from my siblings’ hiding place. This wasn’t the first time, and I thought that, if I could just outlast him, he’d stomp off and it would be over. 

But this time was different. Instead of just using his fists, he picked up a knife that was lying on the counter. Suddenly I realized I was in serious trouble. I scrambled to my feet and backed away, but he followed. Seeing that he wasn’t stopping, I ran frantically through the house, finally coming to the stairs that led down to the basement. With nowhere else to go, and knowing that I was already in more trouble than whatever would come from it, I opened the door and started down the stairs. 

“Get back here!” he screamed, racing after me. He lept at me and tackled me as we fell onto the stairs. I heard something behind me, and shifted my weight and rolled. My father flew off of me and tumbled down the stairs. Without stopping, I ran up the stairs and out of the basement. What I saw when I looked back will stay with me forever. 

Something shambled toward my father’s sprawled form - something that looked familiar. As the chained form approached him, its mouth opened and its teeth bit into his neck. The scream that left his mouth haunts my nightmares to this day. 

Terrified and not wanting to see any more, I closed the door and locked it. 

It’s been several years since then, and my siblings are doing better. Raising them by myself has been hard, but the memories have slowly started to fade. But some things stay with you forever. We don’t make noise. We never leave a mess. We rarely invite anyone over. 

And we never - *ever* - go into the basement. 

Mom likes to be alone.

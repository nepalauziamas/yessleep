Sorry for the delay.

Yes, I'm the poster with the cannibal housemates. 

I also happen to be their dinner every full moon. 

Over the last few days, we’ve been dealing with something we didn’t see coming, so right now it’s hard to post. Still though, I owe you the second part to the post I made the other day. And as much as I tell myself it's not some kind of therapy, or maybe a confession I’m sending into the void—I want to get it out there so I can make peace with what I did that night. In my first post, I made it clear my housemates are not bad people. Regardless of what they are, I still stand by that statement. NOT. BAD. PEOPLE. 

[However, I can’t say the same for myself.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/wp640i/every_full_moon_my_housemates_insist_i_stay_in_my/) 

[I live in a house full of monsters who feast on my flesh to survive—and yet I’m the only one lacking my humanity.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/x3fafg/every_full_moon_my_housemates_insist_i_stay_in_my/) 

Just like the last part, this part will be split into two. For my own sanity. One today, and one tomorrow.

…

…

…

I woke to screaming.

Both inside the room I was in, and further away. Faded, but still bleeding through the walls.

The cries which were closer to me, blowing my eardrums out, weren’t human.  

It wasn’t just screaming. It was brutal. Animalistic. A banshee wail I felt in my brain and in my bones, numbing my body and freezing me in place once I’d seeped from slumber. It took me a moment to grab my bearings, memories flooding back.

I’d  been in the car with Rowan, and we’d… we’d crashed. I remembered I’d died for the 28th time. I remembered the opaque barrier glistening in the middle of the road, and Rowan’s body being copied right in front of me, static becoming flesh, and flesh becoming skin. The rest was a blur. I had a vague recollection of flashes, like my memories were being fast forwarded. Once I knew I was fully real, that my body wasn’t made of static, I had tried to drag Rowan out of the road. Before a sharp pain in the back of my head, the world spinning around, and… darkness. Whoever knocked me out didn’t kill me.

I came to expecting the hollow sensation and the hunger, but I just felt dizzy. I was lying face down on the floor in my bedroom back at the house. I knew it was my room because I could smell the exotic plants I kept on my window, and the raspberry scented air-freshener plugged into the outlet. Slowly, I sat up, resisting the urge to slam my hands over my ears to block out the cry. It was agonising—nothing I’d ever heard before, the lovechild of a dentist drill and a fire alarm. In the corner of my eye, I saw her, a shape bleeding into my vision. 

Somehow, I knew it was pain. It was agony and fear and anger enveloped in one hysterical screech burning her lungs out and setting her body on fire. Imogen. I could feel my housemate’s scream like a living entity crawling inside my brain, creeping up my spine and filling me with poison, challenging my body to try and move. Muffled yelling filled my ears again. It was coming from downstairs—and as if she could feel every one of them, Imogen’s cries grew strangled. Hysterical. Like she was dying.

And somehow, I could feel it. The entity slicing into my soupy brain and twining itself around my spinal cord.

I felt it like a virus, and it was tearing me apart from the inside, setting my body into fight or flight. Pushing her out of my head was hard. She was overwhelming, and every emotion slammed into me like bolts of lightning. Pain. Anger. Desperation.

I checked the door first. Unlocked. The muffled cries hit me again. Louder. But I couldn’t leave her. Not like that. When she said my name through her teeth, I twisted around. Imogen was on my bed. Like Rowan, she was sickly pale and gaunt, but somehow beautiful. Lying in a pool of halo coloured hair and moonlit eyes, my housemate writhed like she was possessed. But she didn’t look like a monster. She was in pain, each wail wracking her body. 

She was like an animal, I thought. An animal who needed to be put down. An animal who I couldn’t stand to see like that. Her vacant eyes didn’t fully find me until I shook her, and life began to prick into her expression slowly before she sat up. Imogen was trembling, her eyes were raw, filled with tears, and not quite human, but I could believe for a moment if I suspended my disbelief, that she wasn’t a monster. My housemate stared at me, blinking rapidly, like I was a hallucination, before her hand whipped out, claw-like fingernails slicing into my flesh. 

I felt her desperation, each nail digging into my skin and drawing blood. At first, I thought it was hunger. But looking at her closely, I realized it was something else. Something which had her teetering on the edge of hysterics. “Stop them.” She whispered. Her breath came out in heavy pants, and I felt each of them like they were my own. I saw something flash across her expression, something feral which she couldn’t control, something which flared in her nostrils. 

She could smell me. Rowan said that the three of them had been starving for the last few days and seeing me must have been agony.

Before she seemingly caught hold of herself. Imogen’s grip loosened, her clammy fingers detaching from my flesh.

My housemate’s expression crumpled, humanity blooming back into fruition. Her voice grew stronger. “Please!” She was growing progressively more hysterical. “You have to stop them! They’re hurting them!” Imogen tried to get up, but she was so weak. I found myself reaching out a hand and yanking her to unsteady feet, and once she could hold herself, my housemate dragged herself over to the door. She needed to eat, I thought dizzily. But it’s not like the snacks I hidden under my bed would do anything—I knew exactly what Imogen needed. Before she could yank open the door, I pulled her back. 

Once I was close enough to the door, I could hear it. Low murmurs, followed by yelling. And judging from Imogen’s expression, I knew we weren’t alone. 

There were people downstairs. Strangers. Remembering the figure looming over me, the person who had knocked me out, bringing me home, I shivered. Who would do that? I thought. They had kidnapped me, and presumably Rowan too—and brought us home? “Stop who?” I managed to get out. 

My housemate was sobbing, trying and failing to get the door open, her twitching fingers scraping the handle. I sucked in a breath and grabbed her hands, squeezing them. The same thing I did when she was assaulted in freshman year, and I found holding her hands and talking to her in hushed whispers calmed her down enough to talk. This time, however, my housemate was inconsolable. I did what I could to break through. “Imogen.” I spoke stiffly. “You need to tell me what’s going on, okay?” I squeezed her hands tighter, and her wails turned into soft whimpers. I hadn’t forgotten what she was, and who I was to her—nothing but flesh.  But right then, we were both dealing with an unsuspected mutual enemy.

I shook her again when she let out a sharp cry. Her whole body was tremoring, and I fought to stable her. Every erratic movement threatened to buckle her legs. 

“Who’s downstairs?”

Her body was still writhing. Jolting. Imogen caught hold of herself and drew in a breath. Her expression darkened, and I caught that sliver of moonlight glinting around her iris. “The people downstairs.” She said through her teeth. “They’re hurting us, and I can’t stand it, Nin. They’re hurting us…they won’t stop hurting us, and my head… my head feels like it’s on fire. I can’t... think straight….” she drifted off, grabbing the door handle with one hand, and my arm with the other. I didn’t fight against her strength. I didn’t hear the rest of what she said, it was caught up in a territorial growl ripping from her throat.

Imogen’s grip tightened once again as my housemate dragged me down the hallway. She flattened us against the wall and twisted to me, pressing a shaky finger to her lips. Follow me. Her eyes said. I held my breath, sticking to her steady stride. “The boy’s.” I managed to get out. “Did they…”

What was I going to say?

Did they hurt someone? Kaz and Rowan were unpredictable under the full moon. I had no idea what they were capable of.

It must have been them downstairs—them doing the hurting. After all, in my head, they were monsters.

“No.” Imogen whimpered. “It’s a group of them.” She said. “They’re hurting us, Nin. Hurting them.”

Imogen’s humanity practically emitted from her like an aura. I saw fear, pain and anger. All human emotions.

“Kaz and Rowan.” She said in sharp gasps. “They killed them. Over and over again, they keep killing them and I—"

Copying, I thought dizzily.

Someone, no doubt the person who had kidnapped Rowan and I was torturing them.

Imogen swallowed a cry, her expression twisting. She didn’t finish that sentence, and that only left more questions as she pulled me further down the stairs. The low murmur of voices got louder, until I could hear them in clarity. A man—or a group of them. As we neared the door, Immie grew stiff. “Stay with me.” My housemate breathed. She turned to me, her eyes glowing that eerie white bleeding into her irises. I couldn’t trust her, not when her expression had melted into something inhuman, something I’d expect from a horror movie. Her teeth came out in a vicious snarl, her steel grip tightening. 

She wanted me to stick with her, to not run. To trust her. Trust the monster I’d caught feeding on my emaciated remains. 

That monster, however, was surprisingly protective. When I tried to pull my arm from hers, Imogen made a hissing sound, digging her fingernails in. When I caught sight of the front door, I had a chance to run. I had a chance to rip my arm from her grasp and lunge into a sprint, and not look back. But I didn’t. You can study these words any way you like, you will never get an answer for why I chose not to run for my life. When I jumped from the last step, the downstairs hallway was quiet. 

The intruders were in the lounge. I could sense them, and I knew she could too, her nostrils flaring like a wild animal as she followed their scent, moving in quick strides. I followed, not as quick as her, my body trying to lean back, trying to escape.

“It’s a full moon.” Immie said under her breath. “Kaz and I had just enough time to protect the house before they came.”

“What?” I managed to get out in a hiss. I’d already checked, and totality wasn’t expected until September 10th. I’d checked multiple times to make sure I’d have enough time to escape before a full moon fell on us. But even as I thought that, my eyes found the clumsily taped up front door, and if I squinted, I could just about glimpse the tiniest fragment of moon peeking in. For once, Immie seemed barely fazed by sudden unexpected totality. “They broke in.” She hissed out. “Those bastards broke in, and took Kaz, locking me in your room. I couldn’t do anything. Not when they were hurting them. I was powerless, Nin.”

As she spoke, my housemate pulled me towards the lounge where I knew the kidnappers were. Immie stiffened up when she reached the door. I think part of Immie enjoyed searching each room beforehand, like she was hunting them down. She reminded me of a lioness losing her cubs. 

Whoever had hurt Kaz and Rowan were dead— and we both knew that. I could tell from the way she moved, squeezing my arm like I was some kind of anchor. 

I found my two other housemates inside the lounge, surrounded by a group of stranger’s. I didn’t know what to look at first. The windows were taped up, blocking out the night bleeding in. Scattered around the room were various versions of my housemates, copies of them strewn across the floor. If it had been my first time, I might have thought I was seeing things—or even in a dream of my own making. There was so much blur between fiction and reality. Inside that room at that moment, that line had been crossed multiple times.

What I was seeing reminded me of an Adult Swim commercial. I can’t remember which one, but I do know that those commercials were made to spread unease and play with that so-called line which separated reality and our own dreams.

The copies were in varying states, decapitated heads and severed limbs leaking static mixed with blood soaking into the carpet. It was like  seeing a cartoon leak into real life. The canny, with the uncanny. My stomach twisted at the sight, before my gaze found the current versions. Rowan and Kaz were strapped back to back, duct tape covering their mouths, feral teeth slicing through the gags. They looked like fresh copies, but I knew from experience the pain clung on, and memories were still fresh, even before they faded. I knew they were strong. 

Rowan had pinned me to my seat with one hand, and Immie’s grip on me was fucking with my blood circulation. But somehow, the restraints pinning their wrists to the chairs armrests was enough to hold them down. Kaz’s gaze had found mine, and he was rapidly shaking his head, gesturing for me to run, while Rowan tipped his head back, snarling through his gag. The two of them were nowhere near moonlight, with it being trapped behind the taped up windows. But I still saw it coming to life in their eyes, in their cracking skin splintering apart, static moonlight leaking out. It was strange seeing the hunters become the hunted. Imogen didn’t speak. 

Her eyes were wide, her expression feral, lips curling into a snarl. When she made a move towards the boy’s, an oldish looking man stepped in front of her, and I recognised him from Sam’s group of friends. He was one of the people who had surrounded Sam’s coffee table, marking something on a piece of paper, and actively trying to hide when Poppy dragged me in. 

Now that I was taking in the others, I realised they were all from Sam’s house. I recognised a dark haired teenage boy, and an older woman with greying hair and a thinning smile. Wielding a knife which I knew had already killed the boy’s multiple times, the man’s eyes ignited. His lips split into a sickening grin. “Ah, the main event!” He chortled, gesturing for his cronies to surround the boy’s.

“See?” The man turned to the others. “We didn’t even have to tie the little freak up.” He grabbed Kaz hair, yanking the boy’s head back. “We’ve been playing with your friends for a while now,” he smirked. “Now you’re deciding to come downstairs?”

I watched the group take their positions, following orders. A familiar sandy-coloured ponytail sent my heart into my throat, and I thought I was seeing things. 

I must have been, seeing things right? Sure, I was seeing some of Sam’s friends, but I wasn’t seeing my best friend himself. That idea quickly splintered when I glimpsed his face. I wanted to find his expression frozen in some kind of trance. I wanted to believe he was brainwashed or under some kind of control. But Sam’s eyes were lit up with excitement, anticipation, his lips pulling into a small smile as his group surrounded Rowan and Kaz. 

He must have seen me with Imogen, must have known that I was in the room. As much as I struggled to meet his gaze, however, I realised he was actively ignoring me. Sam was armed. The boy who told me he was scared of fireworks going off was armed with a scary looking blade sticking from his belt, and a small handgun he kept grasping hold of, the sleek butt moulding perfectly into his hand.

Imogen, who was trembling, stepped in front of me. Her lips curled back into a hiss, and the man’s eyes widened.

“See. A monster.” The man cocked his head, and I tore my gaze from Sam. “A devil too, I presume.”

Devil’s. My eyes found the rest of them, their disgusted sneers. That’s what these people thought they were.

Imogen winced, hurt by their words—but she held herself.

“They’re not devils.” I heard myself say, surprised by my confidence. I had spent days trying to escape the monster’s in my house, the monster’s who were killing and eating me—and yet I was still a resident, and Sam and his gang were intruders.

“Get out.” I said, directing my words at Sam. I was going to kill him. “This has nothing to do with you.”

“No, Nin.” Imogen murmured, her tone almost a purr. “I want to know who the fuck they think they are.”

My housemate’s eyes snapped to the man, her lips curling into a snarl. “Why are you hurting my family?”

Her grip slipped from my arm, and I was free. I was free to run—but I didn’t. I couldn’t.

Immie’s eyes reminded me of a cornered animal. She was frantic. “Who are you?” It was the first time I’d heard my housemate sound threatening. I’d known her for two years, and I’d never seen this side of her. 

The monster she had been trying to hide. 

She opened her mouth to speak, but stopped when the teenage boy, who looked to be thirteen at the oldest, lunged forward, grabbed Rowan by the scruff of his neck, yanked his head back, and plunged the knife he’d been playing with into my housemate’s stomach. He screamed, and it was agonising, a raw wail piercing my brain. But his cry wasn’t alone. Kaz, struggling like crazy, howled into his gag—and Imogen squeaked, slamming a hand over her mouth. And then it hit me. Why I’d woken to her screaming, writhing on my bed. Why her tangled words had been barely decipherable on her tongue.

“Stop!” She screamed, dropping all pretence. “Please! Please stop hurting my brother’s!”

Brother’s.

She’d never referred to them as her brother’s before—or her family. Maybe metamorphosis had changed that. Imogen could feel them. Everything they felt, everything the two of them were going through, she felt it too, and it was ripping her apart.

Every copy of the boys who had been tortured and murdered, Imogen felt everything. Their pain. Their deaths. Their rebirth’s.

Chuckling, the man pulled the knife out with a whistle. It slid easily back through several layers of skin, though the knife was wet with static. Imagine something you didn’t think was tangible, didn’t think could be touched, and there it was, slicking the blade. The man’s eyes were wide, lips curving into a grin. “This is quite the magic trick.” He leered. “Why don’t you tell me, huh? How do you kids do it? We can slice up your boy’s and cut off their heads, and they just fucking grow another one!”

His shriek of laughter pierced my ears, and I caught Rowan’s half lidded eyes flick to the window’s still covered with tape.  

“I’ve got a better question.” The kid stepped forward with a scowl. I expected Imogen to attack him, but she just stood there, paralysed, her body rattling with the boy’s pain. “What did you devil’s do to my brother?” He demanded. “He didn’t come home from class, and he’s still missing. And he’s not the only one. You’ve been pillaging this town for a while now. Witch.”

His words stirred something in my mind. Is that what they had been doing? Before me, had they feasted on others?

Others who didn’t share my ability to come back.

Imogen shook her head. “Your daddy has quite the influence on you,” she whispered. “Go home.”

The leader, who was more in awe than disgusted, laughed. “Nah.” he said. “Let’s have a bit more fun. They’re devil spawn, after all. Inhuman! Why don’t we have another look at what’s inside, hmm?” To my surprise, he gestured to Sam. “The Delacroix boy’s an old flame, ain’t he?” The man chuckled. “He’s all yours, Samuel. And don’t take any mercy, kid. That ain’t who you think it is. It’s a mimic. A creature with the boy’s face and voice, but it’s nothing but a devil possessing his body.”

The man threw his head back and laughed again. “Put the freak down. And if he comes back we’ll do it again, and again, and a -fucking-gain, until. They. Stay. Dead.” Every word had emphasis as he ducked in front of Kaz, spitting each one in his face.

Sam straightened up. He caught my eye before looking away quickly. “Yes, sir.”

“And remember.” The man grunted. “They ain’t human. I don’t know what the fuck they are. Make them hurt.”

Sam didn’t move for a moment before nodding and striding over to my housemate.

Kaz weakly lifted his head, and I caught a look between them. It was so fast I barely saw it, but it was definitely there.

Familiarity and hatred mixed together in a cocktail burning between the two of them. Sam didn’t hesitate, stabbing the teeth of his blade through Kaz’s hand—and just like clockwork, Rowan and Immie reacted in sync. Sam didn’t stop. He plunged it in again and again, and each one was more violent. When Kaz’s body jolted and he lunged forwards in his chair, screaming through the tape over his mouth, Sam twisted the blade in deeper until it had perforated bone. Rowan’s cries turned animalistic as he kicked and screamed, razor sharp teeth slicing through his gag.

Sam. No matter how much he looked like he was enjoying it, there was something else in his eyes. Something I think he was in denial of, which only motivated him further. My housemate’s pained wails were in perfect harmony, and next to me, Imogen took a different stance. “Go upstairs and lock yourself in your room.” She said through sharp breaths. “Just like every other full moon. Don’t come out until dawn.”

“What?” I hissed. “Are you kidding me? I know what’s going on.” I said. “And I want to help.”

“Help?” Imogen’s tone dripped something sour. “So, not run away, Nin? You’re actually going to stay this time?”

“What?”

"Run." She turned to me, her eyes pleading. "Please. Promise me you’ll lock yourself up.”

“Right.” I was already backing away. “But.. why?”

When I risked a look at the boy’s—at Kaz, while Sam dragged a knife down his face, static pouring out, he was shaking his head. Don’t. His eyes were on Immie, desperate, as he struggled under the restraints. He seemed to already know what she was going to do. Imogen tried one more time. “If you want to talk, we’ll talk.” She said. “I’ll tell you everything about what we are. Just let them go.” Her lips pricked into a smile. “That’s your warning. Let them go, or I’ll show you what we are.”

“Show us?” The man scoffed. I inwardly cringed when he raked his fingernails down Rowan’s face. “You’re already showing us! You’re devil’s! Inhuman! You don’t deserve to live! Be thankful we’re merciful enough to put you down right here.”

“Then I’m sorry.” Immie said softly.

“Imogen.” Kaz muffled through his gag. I was getting déjà vu from the last full moon. “Don’t do this.”

“Don’t do what?” The teenage boy joined in, a delirious grin on his face. “You’re weak. And we’ll keep killing you.”

“We just want to talk.” Imogen spoke through a growl. Her patience was thinning. “Let them go, and like I said, we’ll talk.”

But that just  got a laugh from the group in response. Sam, the only one who wasn’t laughing, paused, in mutilating Kaz’s face. I noticed he was slower with the knife, like he was revelling in watching the skin slice open and splinter, bleeding moonlight.  “Talk!” A woman screeched. Her voice was like nails on a chalkboard. “The devil’s want to talk to us?!”

She pointed a gun at Immie. “Tell me, child.” She sneered. “Would you be able to come back from a bullet in the brain? If I blow your head off, will you grow another one like them? Should I test it out? How about severing each of your limbs, hm?”

I saw the exact moment Imogen Prairie gave up. She gave up begging, gave up trying to negotiate—gave up being human.

“There’s a freezer inside Rowan’s closet.” Immie told me. “I want you to ignore what’s in it and lock yourself in there.”

“But—” I choked on my response, and she hissed out, cutting me off.

“Now!”

“Okay.” I heard myself pant. I heard the words hit the sound barrier, but the world was going in slow motion. I was staggering into the wall. Immie was next to me one moment, and then she was at the window, half of her face already illuminated in a semi-circle of moonlight. At first I thought she was going to try another tactic to free the boy’s, maybe from the back. She was fast, after all. Faster than I thought. But no. Before I could cry out—I think I did. I yelled something, and Kaz turned to me with questioning eyes, before twisting to Immie, muffling into the tape over his mouth. Immie didn’t waste time, standing on her tip-toes and clawing at the protection put in place to block out the moon. And almost as if the moon herself had been waiting in anticipation outside, fighting to get in, she seeped into the room, milky white light filing every corner and hitting every surface. I remember turning to run. 

Like Immie told me. Though something made me turn, something, maybe morbid curiosity, twisted my body around and forced me to watch; watch, as I finally realised why my three housemates were so afraid of the full moon and her light. Why they forced me to stay in my room every night and blast music until my ears rung. It was almost like they were waiting for it. At least, Rowan was. I knew part of him didn’t care about the control she had over him, or what she made him do. He just wanted out of that chair. I watched his frenzied gaze on Sam, who was carving Kaz’s face off, before his twitching eyes found each corner the light bounced from. Kaz followed, at first trying to bury his head in his lap, but it was too bright, too powerful, drowning him. Their faces were drenched in her—which was… hypnotising. Just like the night of Abigail Matheson’s party, they stopped struggling, frightened eyes, lips twisted through the gags, going slack.

With her so close, inside the room, she filled me too. I heard her voice, her melodic singing filling their heads. I was aware I was moving in twitching movements, struggling to find a way out. 

But I couldn’t move. She was in my head, twining herself around my being. Filling me. Teasing me. The boy’s eyes filled with that glow. Not just the halo glint I was used to catching. Blinding light which should have burned their eyes out, and yet it didn’t. It was beautiful and horrifying at the same time. I was transfixed by the light, hypnotised by her hitting every reflective surface like she was burying herself further until she was overwhelming us. 

The human’s reacted differently. They seemed more confused. I was watching Sam’s expression twist from morbid pleasure to horror, but my brain couldn’t register what was happening. Why there was suddenly so much red, so much screaming. What my brain had failed to take in, was Rowan ripping from his restraints and pouncing on the woman who had leered at him. I didn’t even see a struggle. I saw his teeth come out in an animalistic shriek, and I saw her headless torso hit the ground. Just like that. 

So fast. 

But he didn’t stop there, tearing into her chest and pulling at squirming, glistening insides, ripping into her until she was squirming flesh palpitating under his weight. I didn’t even Kaz escape, but his chair was knocked over, and there was so much… red. So much fucking red. It was scarlet, glimmering, guts and severed limbs scattering our carpet. 

I’d seen him rip off the teenage boy’s head. I’d seen him rip into the kid’s head, tainted teeth splintering through shattered skull and brain. It was when Rowan coughed up an eyeball still attached to its nerve, and Imogen snatched it up and stuffed it in her own mouth, a pulpy mess of red and white squelching between her too-sharp teeth when I remembered how to move.

Movement behind me. Sam’s sharp, heavy breaths on my neck, whispering for me to get out.

“Get out of here, Nin.” He said, slipping on entrails stuck to the soles of his shoes. “Fucking get out!”

Kaz, still ravaging the corpse of the leader, reacted to Sam’s movement. His neck snapped up, head cocking to the side.

His eyes were vacant.

Sam stumbled back, before I lost sight of him just behind the wall.

My housemate’s face was transformed. No longer human, no longer the boy I knew, twisted into something resembling a zombie. His eyes were milky white, filled, drenched, overwhelmed with her. 

Every part of him was her, his splintered skin bleeding her, his claws digging into flesh and bone. There was nothing there—no ignition in his eyes, nothing to suggest he was a living, breathing human. Looking at Rowan, he had the same look, kneeling over the kid’s body, his hands cupping into the cavity in the gut and scooping out glistening gore. 

Imogen, moving from each body with incredible speed, like an animal, her toes primed, slick with pooling red. I was still standing there, staring, like a fucking idiot, when the three of them seemed to… change. No, that’s not the word.

Kaz stopped mindlessly chewing, a slew of chewed up red mush slipping down his chin. Rowan spat out the severed arm he’d been mauling, and Imogen lifted her head, and looked directly at me. The other two followed, like they shared a hivemind of some kind—a mind which no longer thought like a human, instead like a feral beast.

I would much rather have been ignorant at that moment. I would have happily worn rose tinted glasses. Instead though, it began to dawn on me. Looking at what they were feeding on, they weren’t really eating it. Just chewing and spitting it out, or in Rowan’s case, mauling on it like a dog. When Immie slowly stood up, nostrils flaring, moonlit eyes pinpointing on me, I remembered her words before she surrendered to the moon. 

Go upstairs and lock yourself up. 

And as the three of them began to slowly make their way towards me, like animals cornering pray, I found my gaze going to their so-called meals. None of which they had eaten. Another step. They were taking their time, revelling in my scent, moving as a group. I could sense their mutual agreement that they were going to share. 

When Rowan made a sound cross between a snarl and a snort, I twisted around and ran. The front door was close, but they already knew my thoughts before I did. They knew my destination before it was in my head. Kaz appeared in front of the door, Rowan and Immie behind him. 

So, I dived upstairs. 

Again, though, they already knew. They knew where I was heading. Their footsteps followed me, pounding up the stairs, forcing me to kick myself further into a frenzied sprint. Their breath tickled the back of my neck, and halfway up the stairs, a hand curled around my leg and yanked. I crumpled, losing my grip on the top stair, flailing, and kicking my attacker in the face. Kaz. Faster than the others, a mindless determination glimmered in his eyes, he didn’t stop, didn’t falter, only falling, and getting back up again, crawling up the stairs like a creature from my nightmares. The moon seemed to follow, her light drenching his face. 

Reaching the top, I followed Immie’s earlier words and threw myself into Rowan’s room, slamming the door behind me and throwing my weight into the door. But they were already on the other side, slamming themselves into old wood. Fuck. Scanning my housemate’s room, I glimpsed his closet. They were going to get through. Their combined weight was overwhelming, sending me staggering. I left the door, lunging into the closet just as they broke through the door.

The closet door was flimsy, barely even a door. But something was inside, a large white container my brain didn’t register as a freezer until I yanked it open, finding myself face to face with severed pieces of an earlier version of me. I didn’t have time to be disgusted. Slamming the closet doors shut, or at least trying to shut them as best as I could, I climbed into the freezer, burying myself in my own body parts, and closing the lid shut. 

Sucking in a breath, I waited for them to knock it over, or rip open the lid. Instead though, the three of them didn’t even come in the closet. They knew I was in there—I could hear them clawing at the wood, slamming their weight into it. But for some reason they never came in. When I was sure I was safe, I risked letting out a breath. And then I was too aware of where I was. What I was enveloped in. I reached out, cringing when I touched my own severed flesh. Rowan had cut me into pieces. Probably so I’d last longer. 

My stomach flipped over, and my mouth watered. I was going to throw up. I could feel it, a bile-like paste creeping up my throat. The closet door suddenly flew open, footsteps following. They were in. So close. I could hear their heavy pants. Instinctively, my fingers curled around what felt like a slimy piece of half my torso before something flashed in front of my eyes. A memory from that version of me.

The version they’d murdered and cut up, preserving me in Rowan’s freezer.

This had happened before, I thought dizzily. I’d seen my body’s memories in a sharp blur of colours I could barely focus on.

But this.. this was in clarity. Again, I saw everything through her eyes. Unlike the other memory, it was less like I was seeing it, more like I was reliving it. The graze of cool night air on my bare skin as I opened up our door to a figure on our doorstep.

“Oh, hey!” My own voice was a lot lighter and more energetic. “You’re not the pizza guy.”

“Nin!” Kaz yelled from upstairs. “Did they send extra? It’s fifteen minutes late, they owe us extra soda!”

“Come on, Nin! I’m dying of hunger!” Immie joined in.

“It’s not the pizza guy!” I shouted back through a laugh.

It struck me, then, that I didn’t remember this.

This had been part of my blackouts—what had been ripped from my memories. I felt myself pull away from my body parts, my gut curling at the thought of finally knowing what happened that night. I had to know. Even when part of me cringed away, refusing to accept a certain part of myself, I needed to understand the events. 

So, ignoring my body’s insistence to let go, I dug my nails into my own severed flesh, willing myself to delve back into the memory when it started to blur out of focus.  A woman. She was maybe in her late fifties or early sixties with white hair growing grey at the ends. Her smile was friendly, and I instantly trusted it.  “Good evening.” She said, “Would you mind helping me out?” she chuckled, and I felt the dread building in my current self, as well as in my memory. In my memory, however, I ignored the alarms. “I am quite lost. This is Bolivia House, right?"

This was exactly what present Rowan was talking about. What he was made to remember unless he ate. This was what drove them crazy unless they feasted on me every night, what played in their heads like a stuck record. Finally, I was going to see why they—or at least Rowan—couldn’t look me in the fucking eye.

Maybe I’m spacing out these posts so I don’t have to lay out the skeletons in my closet. Even anonymous, it still feels wrong. 


Still. I’ll be back tomorrow with the rest.

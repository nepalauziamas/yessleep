I dont know if anyone ones gonna see this but just typing this out for people to read and beware of their surroundings.
(Both happened when i was 13/14 Fem)

1) It was around 9 pm and i noticed that my male dog needed to go outside. I put his leash on and started heading to a patch of grass directly across my apt. I notice some guy, kinda skeptical at this point but then i saw him going to his car. What creeped me out is that he stopped heading for his car and later i didn’t know where he went so i just thought he left. 1 min later some lady comes to throw out her trash and thats when i noticed the guy come out from hiding behind the dumpster near the grass. I thought she was gonna stay for a bit but then she got in her car and left. So now it was just the creepy guy and me and my dog. He starts saying something so i start walking away with my dog. He then starts tryna tell me to come to him and thats when i started speed walking away. The weird thing is that what wouldve happened to me if the lady didn’t throw out her trash or what wouldve happened to her if i wasnt walking my dog.

2) This happened when the sun was still out.I went to take my female dog outside and saw that she wanted to go near the canal because theres grass and not a lot of dog poop on the ground. So i was waiting for her to do her business and thats when i notice a guy coming towards me. And then he says “can i ask you something” i get weirded out and say”no sorry” because why tf would you go up to a teen to ask them something. thats when i start walking away but then notice that the guy was following me. So i start speed walking toward this patch of grass between my apt buildings. How this patch of grass works is that from where the guy was, he wouldnt be able to see me  behind the corner,so as soon as i get on the grass i pick up my dog and start darting for the stairs. I dont live upstairs, but i ran upstairs so incase the guy was still behind me he wouldnt know where i lived. I stayed upstairs looking iver the balcony to make sure he wasnt there. I stay there for a while as my heart is beating out of my chest. A few mins later thats when i run downstairs directly into my apt with my dog in my hands.

After these experiences, ive always been on edge and skeptical when i go outside and try not to go outside later than 9 even if its just to walk my dogs. I kinda end up looking paranoid but its whatever gets me to stay safe

My sister is an actual fucking demon. These are the series of events that have occurred that have led me to believe so.

We'll hit it off by saying my name is Adam. I just turned 16 on Sunday, and my family and I went to the movies to celebrate. Now, my family is hella religious. The type where I can't pierce my ears cause I'm a guy and not praying is a sin. When I was younger, my dad would enforce these rules of his by punishing me and my sister. My dad is a cruel man. He was never religious until he hit his 40's, and now he's almost 60. I wasn't around when he was nicer and more lenient but my sister was and she told me that it was better back then. She says it wasn't my birth that changed things about our family. That stuff was already up shit's creek way before I was conceived.

My dad changed when I turned like 3. Something was just wrong and I'm not gonna beat around the bush (ha beat) cause he beat us. He didn't hit me nearly as much as he hit my sister, most likely because I was younger. My sister is 8 years older than me. I get the feeling she doesn't really like me because she never talks to me or anything, but my friends say their older siblings are detached too. It probably has something to do with the heavy trauma too though. So anyway yeah. My dad hit her a lot and the only reason I remember is cause she told me. I remember when I would do something wrong, a minor inconvenience really, and he'd bust a fuse and smack me across the face. If he lost his own wallet and couldn't find it, we had to look for it. If we didn't find it in time, the more and more pissed he got and the more likely we'd get the brunt of it. So after stuff like that my sister would sneak into my room and close my door. She'd sit on my bed and try to console me and shit, telling me it's not okay what's happening, but that I would have to get used to it because dad was sick and mom wasn't gonna do shit about it.

Back to the religious shit. My mom and dad are super religious. I'm talking praying every single day, prayers before every meal, no drinking, drugs, smoking, premarital sex, gay people are sinners, blah blah blah. Hey, if they like Trump there's no telling what kind of people they are. I could sit here and try to explain to you all day why they're not the shiniest pieces of shit in the bucket but I'm sure you get that by now. My sister was raised to be just as religious. Thing is she never took a shine to it. When she was in high school she had super long hair and one day she snuck off and just cut all of it off. My parents were pissed for like months. I know cause they'd complain to me when she wasn't home. My sister listened to loud music in her room all the time and locked her door all the time too. She didn't like people coming inside. Now I know why.

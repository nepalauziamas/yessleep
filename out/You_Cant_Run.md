The autumn air felt good to my lungs after a long jog this morning. Tonight, my friends and I were headed out to the yearly fall carnival downtown, just a few blocks down. I was the last of us to turn 21, though that didn’t make much of a difference, only easier. I was excited for tonight. My friend Ernesto’s girlfriend, Amber, introduced me to this one girl whom I have been speaking to for a while now, Audrey. Well, a couple of times anyways when she was with Amber. She’s not from around here. We seemed to have gotten along pretty well though. We exchanged numbers. She’s smart, has goals in life, she’s a bigger music buff  than I am, and tonight she’ll be there. I’m not one for hopeless romanticism but everything just felt perfect and relaxing tonight as we briskly walked down the dim lit roads, bustling with people, kids playing, neighbors talking and barbecuing by a front yard bonfire, the smell of brisket in the air. Downtown, everything was lit up. The city forked over the funding for a sizable carnival with all the good rides, and all the local businesses were out representing. Wouldn’t you know it too, Jeremy’s band even got on the list of local talent playing on stage. I think Ernesto sensed that I needed some mental zen. For the past month or so, my family and I had found out that my brother Carlos, who was in the National Guard and helping search for survivors of a recent hurricane that had caused a lot of damage, was himself missing in action. At least we had not heard from him in a while. 

I was paranoid, anxious. Carlos was not only my older brother but a close friend of mine as well. He introduced me to most of the good things in my life; music, classic movies, cooking, the best conspiracy theories. Now with him gone, I had been feeling as though life itself was “off”. I would sometimes feel reality warp around me, I would see shadows and apparitions almost clear as day. My therapist had said that it could be a mix of the pressure I was under and also dealing with the potential loss of my brother. I would sometimes hear him calling to me.

“Don’t run! Come to me.”

Tonight was going to be different though. For the first time, I felt at peace. Ernesto and I made our way down Main Street to the city park where the carnival extended, and there she was. Audrey was there waiting with Amber,  waiting for us. They were talking to another friend of ours, Ron, though he left when we arrived. The flirtatious bastard. Audrey looked up and smiled at me. My heart was racing. I felt tingly. I didn’t know what the hell I was doing. 

“Hey,” I said with a nervous smile.

“Hey.”

“How was the drive down here?”

“It’s not too bad. I come here often to visit friends and family anyways.”

“Cool, that’s cool.”

“Yeah…” she said with a smile. 

“How’s your older sis doin’?’“

“Oh, she’s good. The doctor said it wasn’t super bad. She’s just a drama queen.” 

“Alright!” Ernesto boldly interrupted. “What do you guys want to do first? You guys wanna get some hot dogs or something?”

“Nah, I just ate a protein bar, I’m good for a while,” answered Amber. 

“I’m fine for now too,” added Audrey. “Let’s just look around and see what’s up.” 

We rode a few rides first, the Ferris wheel, the tornado and such. Surpringly, Audrey was able to get me onto the rides as I tend to be a big wuss. After a while, Audrey and I were both a bit hungry so I ended up just getting her and myself a churro. Being the wingman that he was, Ernesto decided to head off with Amber and give us some privacy. I tried the cliche “winning a stuffed animal” at one of the dart booths. I took aim at one of the easier targets, hand shaking noticeably, which Audrey found amusing, with her smile. 

“So your sister has been giving you the runaround huh?” I asked.

“Yeah, she can be super high strung at times. Jim has been helping her around the house way more though, so that’s good.”

“….That’s good. He didn’t strike me as the asshole type.”

“She just does everything you know?” Audrey answered enthusiastically. “ I’m glad I have her as I’d be basically homeless without her and she’s kept me sane, but sometimes I wish she would just chill, like, I’m not going out to crazy parties or doing drugs or anything.”

“She probably feels like she has to make up for lost ground with you or something,” I said, letting my third or fourth dart fly into the wall.

“Yeah, maybe. And my niece and nephew run her ragged. Don’t get me wrong, I love them, but I don’t know where they get their energy,” she said with a laugh. “And what about you?” She asked me by name. “How have you been feeling? Have they found your brother?”’

“No, no not yet,” I said hesitantly. I could tell she internally cringed but I was glad she asked. She was genuine in her care. I quickly shot her a smile. “Carlos is crazy tough though and a survivor. I still think he’s okay.”

Suffice it to say, I didn’t win her the stuffed bear. It didn’t matter though. I felt comfortable around her. We walked and talked for longer, mostly about music, family and such. We drifted away from the carnival down the dimly lit yet still lively streets of my little town. 

My heart sank suddenly. “No not now! Not friggin’ now!” I thought to myself. I was hoping that tonight would be relaxing enough to allow my mind to rest and heal, but evidently not. Off in the distance of the street, I saw what I can only describe as a distortion. I slowed but didn’t want to stop. I didn’t want to let on that I might be going crazy.

“Wait, you see it too?” She asked with urgency.

“Wait what? You see it?” I was both astonished and somewhat relieved. Maybe I wasn’t going crazy after all. 

“Yeah, I see it!” She exclaimed. At first, I thought it was just me. What do you think it is?”

“I don’t know, it looks crazy, like some kind of warp in space time or something.”

“Yeah, like a lense or something!”

“you wanna go down this other street?”

“Let’s check it out,” she said, “Maybe it’s just a mirage.”

We moved closer. I was hoping that it was just some illusion of light or something, but it was most definitely there, and moving closer to us.

“Okay, now I’m freaked!” She said, we started speed walking back towards a cross street, all the while looking back. The anomaly started to grow, distorting our view or nearly the entire end of the street. It started to take form and darken in color. My heart was racing. I looked around us and noticed the lights from the street lamps seemed as though they were changing colors. I looked over to her. She noticed as well. We turned down a cross street, still keeping a brisk pace. I turned once more and there it was. I stopped. So did Audrey. We turned to fully look at the thing. It was a large black mass now, the shape of a person. It began to emit a low hum. Then I heard it. 

“Don’t run! Come to me!” It called out in my brother’s voice to me by name. My heart sank into my stomach. 

“Oh my god, did you hear that?” She asked. 

“Yes, I did. It sounded like my brother.” 

“Wait, you heard your brother?” She said. When it speaks, I hear my sister!

“Your sister’s still alive though isn’t she?”

“Yes!” She exclaimed, and then pondered that thought. “At least, I hope she is.”

We continued on into the night. As I scanned the neighborhood, nothing seemed right; the colors of the light were fluctuating, the distance of the street seemed to stretch and collapse like a rubber band, textures of houses and trees seemed to run like paint. I would look to Audrey and she would acknowledge what I was seeing as well. Her hand was shaking in mine and was cold. We saw a group of three middle aged men, sitting in a front yard and drinking. They spoke inaudibly, the the distortion of a radio. 

“Hey!” We call out to them. They didn’t look to us, just kept speaking to one another. “Hey, over here!” I called again.

“Hey, can you hear us?” Audrey tried calling as well but with no luck either.

“They don’t notice us,” I said. 

“I’m scared,” and held on to me tighter.

We heard the anomaly call out to us again. This time I heard both my name and her sister calling out to her as well.

“I do hear it!” I said to her. “I hear bother my brother and your sister.” We turned to see two anomalies this time, slowly floating towards us. 

“Can we even escape them?” Audrey asked. “This seems like a nightmare.”

“I don’t know,” I confided in her, “but we better keep moving until we figure something out.”

The anomalies seemed to be moving slow but our world around us seemed to also be going more haywire with odd distortions; children playing in the streets, frozen in time, basketballs floating in the air, a car warped out of shape. We tuned an ally which seemed unaffected, desperate to get away, then there it was, 

“Don’t run! Come to me. Follow me. Hear my voice.” One of the anomalies appeared in front of us. Audrey screamed in fright. It reached out its translucent tentacles and latched on to me. 

“Fight!” It said to me. “Hear my voice! Come back to me!” It pulled me in. Audrey tried to grab me by the waist and pull but provided little resistance. Yet, I didn’t feel fear for some reason. The Anomaly began to shine like a miniature hazy sun. “Follow my voice,” it would say to me by name. “Listen to the sound of my voice.” For some reason, I gave in to it, and disappeared into its light. 

Then darkness fell around me, like sleep. I don’t know how much time passed. I felt warm inside. I had a massive headache. My eyes were closed. Where was I? I slowly opened my eyes. I looked around. I was in a hospital room. It was day. Were we rescued? I felt a fog in my mind begin to clear up. Like the rush of warm water, my memories began to flow back into my mind. No, Oh god know. I know what happened now.

I remembered. I was beginning to slowly remember everything. I’m not in my twenties, I’m in my thirties. My brother never passed away. He was found later, with a group of survivors. And Audrey? She is my wife. My beautiful, kind, intelligent wife. We never met in our youths. We met in our late twenties while in rehab. She was brought over to the states from Guam by an aunt but was in and out of foster care until they found her older sister, who helped to take care of her as much as she could. My brother did likewise for me almost. By all accounts, our relationship should have been a toxic one, but we benefited each other. I wanted to be a better person for her. We both gave up drinking. We helped each other find stable jobs and moved in together. Soon after we got married. We even wanted a kid. Yes, I remember now. But we couldn’t conceive. We were happy though. I even told her that I wished we had met sooner. Things may have been different. So then what happened? 

A man and a woman came into the room, the woman I could see was a doctor. The man was carrying a bag with a familiar logo on it. Of course. I remember now.

“Good morning,” said the doctor. “How are you feeling?”

“I’ve got a crap headache right now,” I answered.

“It should go away soon. You’re hooked up to a solution with ibuprofen.” The doctor pulled a light and began to shine it in my eye and began to run some diagnostic tests on me. The man began setting up a laptop.

“Do you remember anything?” Asked the doctor.

“Um, yeah, it was all starting to come back to me.”

“Do you know who you are, where you’re from?….”

“Yeah…..” I replied and answered her questions.

“Do you remember what happened?”

“Yes…..” I replied, and the man began to put stick wires on my head.

“I’m told that what happened is a rare occurance. You’re healthy physically in every other way, but we want to run an MRI and have a neurologist take a look at you.”

“Where is my wife?” I asked bluntly.

“She’s still in a coma.” Answered the doctor.

“We had asked your brother to come and help bring you out and your wife’s sister to bring your wife out,” the man chimed in. “Your brother is still in the hospital and will be able to visit you later. “

“I want to see my wife,” I said with tears almost welling up. 

“We may need you to,” said the man.

This was all my fault. I had read about this kind of experimental “memory therapy” in which new memories can be implanted and old memories erased. I had wanted to forget our past. My wife was reluctant but she agreed for me. According to the man, we had gone too deep in. So they enlisted the help of our family to help bring us out. Now my wife is stuck there, alll because of me. All because I wanted to forget our past, despite our present being so good. What have I done?

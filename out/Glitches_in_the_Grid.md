Hello, I hope I am in the right place and that you’d find it interesting.  

There’s something that has been on my mind ever since the year 2020. The year I began noticing glitches in real life and not just on YouTube videos ;)

On the first glitch, I was walking home and noticed a woman, who looked exactly like me, walking towards me. She wore the same clothes, same shoes, same everything... She didn’t notice me since she was chatting with a guy who walked beside her and I remember I thought to myself, ‘hey, sh\*t just got real…’ I didn’t freak out or anything I was just envy since that girl seemed happy while I was born depressed.  

On the second glitch, I was running some errands and noticed a woman standing in front of an apartment building. She was busy with her phone while her shopping bags were on the floor surrounding her legs. Suddenly, I heard a sound of a tree branch, I looked towards the tree in front of me and noticed the same woman coming out from behind the tree and walking towards the same apartment building. She wore the same clothes and carried the same shopping bags. At that moment I thought to myself ‘what would happen when the lady standing next to me finishes messing with her phone? Will she freak out to meet herself at her apartment or just be excited she now has two of everything she bought?’

On the third glitch, I promised to help a friend and make a small delivery by foot. I was planning on walking through a certain street in order to reach my destination but before I left my friend’s house, she said it would be shorter to walk through a different street so I listened to her advice (which happened to be false by the way).

As I was walking that street, I felt a very warm feeling that drawn me in. I looked at the sky and noticed a beautiful, clear sun shining over the road and washing it with an amazing light. The sun was symmetrical to the road and the street was so quiet, which I figured it’s two in the afternoon, people probably taking their nap or something.

Suddenly, I notice a black van standing in the middle of the road. There was a little crossroads ahead of me and the van was just standing in the middle. I was thinking to myself ‘I was just enjoying the beautiful sun light over the road for the past couple of minutes, how come I didn’t notice the big black van in the middle of it?’  

I wasn't scared but was kind of angry that the warm feeling which accompanied me disappeared.

As I was getting closer I tried to see if there was anyone driving the van but couldn’t see anyone. I reached the crossroads and was about to cross it when I noticed a tall man standing right next to me with his back towards me, he had a bicycle between his legs and was wearing shorts. I remember his skin looked pale and frozen and that was the point I got a little bit scared.  

There were only ten steps between us but I figured if I walk towards him maybe men with white robes will come out the black van and … (yeah, too much TV series, I know). So I just stood there frozen myself, turning my head left and right to see who will move first- the black van or the pale frozen man?

The street was empty and quiet and after five minutes a second black van arrived behind the first one and honked so the first one would move forward and it did! Slowly without having any driver starting it, I remember the sound of its wheels over the road, it made me feel like I was in some kind of a horror movie and it was time for me to get out of there. As I was leaving I heard a bicycle passing me by from behind, I turned around quickly and saw no one but the same pale, frozen man still standing there. This time I watched him from a different angle and let me tell you, people always talk about ‘fight, flight or freeze’ -I am talking about, get the f\*\*k out of here!.

The next day, I thought to myself how it was very easy to stage a scene of a van and a frozen man but probably impossible to stage a complete silence and a beautiful sun light so I went there again, day after day to see if I can get the same warm welcoming feeling as I had that day. What I found was nothing but a noisy street with yelling moms and kids inside their apartments, the sun wasn’t even in the same spot even though it was the same hour and there were pretty loud sounds of buses and trucks coming from the main road next to the street in question.

The year 2020 is long gone and so are the glitches and I am starting to think what really happened that year that they needed us all to be behind closed doors?

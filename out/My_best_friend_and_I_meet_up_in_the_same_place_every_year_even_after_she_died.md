It was the beginning of June. That night, the moon was full. Bright silver moonlight shone across the rippling water. But here, under the bridge, it was still dark. I could barely see Tina’s green eyes against the shadows.

“We’re going to be seniors next year,” she said. In a sad, somber tone of voice I’d never heard her use before. “Promise me, no matter where we end up, we won’t grow apart. Promise me we’ll be friends—forever.”

We were sitting at our usual hangout spot. In the woods behind Tina’s house, under the concrete bridge that spanned across the creek. We sat on the ledge, feet dangling in the air as the water rushed and murmured below us.

“Of course I promise! Wherever we are, I’ll be texting you every day. You’ll be annoyed with me, it’ll be so much.” 

She didn’t smile.

“Tina?”

“Let’s promise to meet right here, every year.”

My brows furrowed. “What do you mean?”

“I mean, we make a pact. That every, say… July 12th, at midnight, we meet here.”

“Uh… okay… but we’ll see each other a lot more than once a year. Even if we’re thousands of miles away.”

“Just promise me, Madhu.”

I thought I could make out the glint of tears in her eyes.

“Uh, sure, I promise.”

She reached into her bag. I heard the sound of a zipper—then a wet *smack* as she rubbed something on her hand. *What is she—*

She grabbed my hand and shook it.

“Ew, Tina! What *is* that?”

“Just trying to make our pact permanent. Like a blood pact.”

“What…”

“I’m just kidding! It’s new lotion I got at Target. Sniff it. Vanilla and cinnamon.”

I sniffed. It did smell like vanilla and cinnamon—though there was a hint of something else, too. Something sort of earthy. “I don’t like it,” I said as I wiped the gunk off on my jeans. “Next time you put lotion on me, could you, like, *warn* me first?”

She giggled.

And so, a tradition was born. Around 11:30pm every July 11th, I’d pack up a small stash of my parents’ alcohol and bring it down to the stream. Tina would be waiting for me—somehow, she always got there first—and we’d drink whiskeyed-up root beers while splashing our feet in the cool water, talking about everything under the sun.

Finally, July 12th, 2019 came. The summer after senior year. I was going off to the east coast for NYU, while Tina was going to college just an hour over the Indiana state border.

That meeting had a different vibe. She was quiet as I climbed down the riverbank. As I walked towards her, cool water running over my bare toes, and then pulled myself up onto the ledge.

“So. We’re going to be more than a thousand miles away,” Tina said.

“Yep,” I replied.

We drank our whiskey-root-beers in silence for a few minutes.

“Promise me you’ll meet me here next year.”

“You know I will.”

I didn’t tell her that night. I wanted to—badly—but the timing just wasn’t right. We were going to be a thousand miles apart. Attending different colleges. Leading different lives, so far away from everything that we had ever known.

I couldn’t tell her my secret, no matter how desperately I wanted to.

So I pressed my lips together and acted normal. Talked about everything we always talked about. Tina’s sister was still overprotective, telling her not to drink at college (oops, too late) and that we were probably going to get murdered if we kept hanging out at the creek in the middle of the night. Anthony was still a good-for-nothing cheater, cheating on his new girlfriend only two months after he broke up with me.

For three hours, I felt like things were normal, like nothing was changing. Like everything was going to be the same.

Forever.

Around three am, we snuck back through the woods and went home. I saw Tina a few more times that summer—in the daylight, in coffee shops and ice cream parlors, never at the old creek where there was nothing between us but the murmuring water. Then I was waving goodbye and hopping on a plane to New York City.

And I hate to say it… but Tina was right.

Between classes and social events, I didn’t have much time for friends back home. Even Tina. Daily texting sessions, telling each other every minute detail of our days, slowly turned to once-a-week “how are you”s. Tina wanted to visit me—she brought it up a few times, offering to meet halfway or even drive all the way up to New York. But somehow the dates never lined up. Somehow there just wasn’t the time between quizzes and parties and new friends.

And then it happened.

I was on the way back from Biochem when I got the call. “Madhu, I’m so, so sorry,” my mom said, barely understandable through sobs. “But Tina’s dad just told me, she got in a car accident…”

*No.* The student center spun around me as I stood, locked in place, praying she wasn’t going to say those next four words.

“She didn’t make it.”

The next few weeks were a blur as I flew home to attend Tina’s funeral. As I stood up and said words about my best friend in the whole world. Tina’s dad, normally stoic and gruff, bawled his eyes out in the front row. Her sister Tiffany, sharing Tina’s tall build and curly hair, just stared at me with hollow eyes.

I didn’t blame her. I felt hollow too, like a piece of me was just… gone.

*And I didn’t even get to tell her…*

That summer I got an internship in Dayton, only an hour from my childhood home. As July 11th approached, I got increasingly depressed. I had to take a few sick days off work just to get my head on straight.

After a long therapy session, I decided to go down to the old bridge on July 12th. I’d drink a whiskey root beer and celebrate her life. Tell her all the times she made me smile. Maybe her ghost would hear me and smile too.

And I’d finally tell her my secret.

Tina’s dad didn’t live there anymore, but I snuck through the backyard anyway, keeping to the edge of the woods. It was hard seeing her bicycle gone, replaced by a little toy car for toddlers. I swallowed down the tears and entered the woods, the liquor bag heavy on my shoulders.

It was a hot, sticky July night. Crickets chirped as I made my way through the woods, the leaves crunching under my feet.

And then I heard the gurgles of the stream.

I angled my body as I climbed down the muddy riverbank. I toed off my shoes, left them on one of the low rocks by the shore, and stepped into the water.

The darkness under the bridge was impenetrable. I set my bag on the ledge, hoisted myself up. Popped open a can of root beer, took a sip. Poured whiskey out of the flask until the can was overflowing.

Then I finally spoke.

“So. Tina. You didn’t show.”

I forced a laugh—but it came out as more of a strangled sob.

“Fuck, I wish you were here right now. I miss you so much.”

I took a sip. Then another. And another.

“Remember that time in third grade? When you threw up on Jenna Bartley on front of Seth? She was soooo pissed. Every time we passed her in the hallway she looked like she wanted to strangle you.”

Only the soft gurgles of the stream replied.

“Yeah. We had some good times, didn’t we?” I took a long sip. The crickets had stopped chirping—or maybe they’d never been chirping in the forest, only in the neighborhood. I didn’t remember.

“There was something I never got to tell you.” I swallowed, the lump in my throat growing. “I meant to. But I was scared. And I kept waiting, and waiting…”

I sucked in a deep breath. I knew I was just talking to thin air, but my heart was pounding in my chest. *Just say it.* My hands trembled.

“Tina, I… I think I was in love with you.”

The water gently lapped over the rocks.

“I don’t know. But the way I felt about you, it was different from the way I felt about anyone else. Even Anthony. The night he broke up with me, I was bawling my eyes out, but… somehow I knew it was all going to be okay. Because I had you.”

I took a sip straight from the flask.

“I didn’t want to say anything because I didn’t want to ruin our friendship. And I wasn’t even sure if that’s what it was, you know? I mean, I don’t like girls. But… I liked *you*.”

A tear rolled down my cheek.

“I *loved* you.”

And then I heard it.

A soft *snap.*

I jolted upright. Then I sucked in a deep breath. *Calm down. Probably just a deer.* There were a ton of deer in these woods. I mean, an actual *person* wouldn’t be out this late, right? In this little patch of unknown woods behind a suburban neighborhood?

Right?

I glanced left. Upstream. Water rolling gently over the rocks, catching in the moonlight. I glanced right. The riverbank I climbed down, my shoes sitting on the stones—

*Scrrrrp.*

Every muscle in my body froze. Because that sound—that was undeniable. It wasn’t a deer, or some woodland animal, or anything else.

It was the soft scuffing sound of a shoe on concrete.

Coming from right above me.

*Someone’s on the bridge.* I held my breath, my entire body shaking. *Don’t make a sound. Don’t. Make. A. Sound.* There was no way anyone would know I was down here. No way—

Except for my shoes on the rocks.

*Scrrrrp.*

*Should I run?* But the water was a foot deep, or more. Too slow. By the time I got to the riverbank, they’d already be there.

*Stay here. Wait for them to pass.* I slowly, carefully, sucked in a shuddering breath. *Probably just some drunk teenager, like Tina and I were. Or some high-as-fuck person stumbling their way home.* They probably didn’t even notice the shoes.

*Don’t make a sound.* I gripped the rough cement with my hands. Tried to stop my legs from shaking. Tried to stay as silent as I possibly could.

But it didn’t matter.

*Cling-bling!*

My phone’s text sound echoed off the concrete—and the limping footsteps immediately stopped.

*No. No, no, no.*

Dead silence rang in my ears. No crickets, no rustling of animals, no insects buzzing. Nothing. It was like whoever was up there… their presence had scared everything away.

*Scrrrrp.*

The footsteps resumed.

But this time, they were going the *other* direction.

Towards the riverbank.

Fear pounded through me. I lunged for my purse. “Come on, come on,” I whispered as I rummaged through old lip balms and broken pens. I finally pulled out my phone, unlocked it, and began to dial 911—

*Splash.*

*Oh fuck oh fuck they’re in the water—*

“911, what is your emergency?”

“I’m under the bridge behind—”

And then it happened.

I lost my balance on the concrete ledge. I scrambled for purchase, but I was already falling. The phone went flying out of my hands and plunked into the creek.

I fell face-down in the water.

Sound cut off. The cold water shocked my body like a thousand tiny needles pricking my skin. My hair fanned around me, tangling over my face.

*Phone’s gone.*

*No one knows you’re here.*

*Run. Run as fast as you can.*

I pushed myself up, sputtering.

A figure stood at the other end of the bridge.

Tall and thin, silhouetted by moonlight. Watching me. I couldn’t see its face, yet somehow—its shape, the way it stood…

“T—Tina?”

She didn’t move.

My arms shook underneath me as I pushed myself to stand. Stars swam in my vision. I leaned against the concrete ledge, feeling like every ounce of blood had drained from my body.

*There’s no way that’s Tina.*

*Tina is fucking dead.*

*Get out—get out of there now.*

My mind was screaming. But I couldn’t force myself to move. It was like I was hypnotized, like I wanted so badly for it to be real that my body was frozen. “Tina,” I whispered, the sound echoing off the concrete in ethereal hisses. “Tina, is that you?”

She slowly tilted her head.

And then she began walking towards me.

*Splash.* One step. *Splash.* Another. My heart pounded in my chest as she closed the gap between us, her face still hidden in shadow.

She stopped two feet away from me.

This close, I could almost make out the contours of her face. Her green eyes. Her curly hair. I could almost smell that vanilla-cinnamon-earthy smell, just like on the night we made our pact—

She raised her arms.

And then, in a split second, pushed me down.

My head plunged underwater. I opened my mouth to scream—and sucked in a mouthful of water. *Not Tina. It’s not Tina.* Pain shot through my lungs. I pushed against the rocky floor, as hard as I could.

I broke the surface.

The tall, thin silhouette stood over me. Curly hair hung over her face. Teeth shined in the darkness as her lips pulled into a smile.

“It’s your fault,” she said in a low, gravelly voice.

I tried to scream—but all I could do was cough up the water I’d breathed in.

“It’s your fault she’s dead.”

And then my head plunged back underwater.

*Tina’s sister.* Her same tall, thin build. Her same curly hair. No wonder I’d thought she was actually Tina, standing there at the other side of the bridge.

“She was on her way to you!” Tiffany’s voice was muffled above the surface, but I could still hear her as I tried desperately to pull my head out of her grasp. “She was going to surprise you. Drive all night so you’d have the whole weekend together. But you didn’t give a shit about her, did you? Didn’t have even two minutes to text her back?”

*I loved her.*

“She had friends. She had me. But all she wanted was *you.”*

My eyes blinked open underwater.

I reached out my arms up. Found Tiffany’s wrist on my head. Dug my fingernails in as hard as I could.

She yelped in pain.

And then she let go.

I pushed myself up. Kicked off against the rocks. Ran as fast as I could through the water without looking back. I scrambled up the riverbank and broke into a sprint, coughing and lightheaded but pushing forward for one reason.

Tina.

\*\*\*

It’s been three years since Tina died.

Tiffany served a short sentence for assault and is living thousands of miles away on the west coast. I’ve moved to Dayton after graduating, working for the same company I had the internship with. I’ve started dating someone recently who seems really great.

Life has been good.

Except for the fact that Tina is still gone.

Every July 11th, around 11:30 PM, I make my way back home. I sneak into the woods and go down to the old creek. The path is overgrown now, but I still force my way down, even if it means fighting a few thorny bushes.

Then I sit under the old concrete bridge and listen to the murmurs of the stream.

Wondering if somehow, somewhere, Tina is listening with [me.](http://www.reddit.com/r/blairdaniels)

As I stood at the edge of the dark never ending forest sweat streaming from my forehead stinging my eyes I saw before me a path and started trekking through. 
I called out to Jesse but got nothing in return.
 It was so quiet that you could hear a fly piss.
All I could hear was the thump of my heart beat radiating in my eardrums. 
I don't know what I'm facing. 
But I do know it's cunning, fast and one hell of a hunter. 
I look at my watch [1:40 am] it'll be daylight soon. Maybe I'll have the advantage. 
I clutch my shotgun close and keep moving. 
It was my husbands. I remember when he first got it from his brother for Christmas to hunt with. He never got around to using it. But if I can find this thing I'll make damn sure I get good use out of it. 
I trekked on for what felt like hours until I came across a small clearing with 3 tents and what seemed like a
Person inside. Huge Bright lights luminated the surrounding area and a hum of voices arose above the tent.

[ MAN ] "did you find it yet?"

[ MAN OVER RADIO ] "negative sir no sign of UHC1 sir"

[ MAN ] "god damn it castor FIND. IT. or I will have your ass!! If that thing gets far enough to civilization then we've screwed the pooch!! I will not look like a god damned fool Infront of the man Are we clear??" 

[MAN OVER RADIO] "10-4 sir"

[MAN] "good, now do your fucking job. I don't want to start over more than I have to."


I hunched lower into the bushes to get a better look at the man speaking. He was dressed like a MIB character. Puffing a lucky strike. Gun strapped to his waist in a holster. This was much bigger than I thought. I slowly rose the shotgun into view and stepped into the light. 

"WHERE IS HE" 

I said in a loud voice
He shot around as if someone just spat on his mother's grave and started to draw from his holster. Then stopped mid way. 

"WHERE IS MY SON" I said

He smirked the calmly said "Ma'am now let's just talk about this. You aren't supposed to be here this is governme-"

I SAID. WHERE. IS. MY. SON. I know you have something to do with This-This fucking creature" 

I said growing more and more angry by the minute.

He inhaled then threw his cigarette to the ground. Then exhaled and said 

"ma'am this does not concern you I advise you turn and go home and lock your doors" 

I, now completely livid inched closer and raised the shotgun to his head

 "it became my concern the moment that thing took my boy" I gritted through my teeth

"Listen lady, this thing is far more than your little Mossberg can handle. If you aren't going to heed my warning then a little advice to you, it's as fast as a mustang. Smart as a trained assassin. And as evil as a red eyed rattlesnake. Your son is probably long dead by now so I suggest you turn and-" 

I cocked the shotgun and blew a shot next to his foot

"I am DONE playing games with you. How do I kill this thing. Tell me everything you know or this coming breath will be your last" I spat 

He threw his hands in the air and shook his head

"I told you what I know on its profile. as far as killing it you'd have to get close and shoot it in the heart but I suggest you don't try to kill it and maybe just try and save your brat and yourself and get the hell out of dodge. Like I said. This is above you lower your weapon and let's talk about this like civil adults." 

I hesitated to lower my weapon. Then slowly let it down. 

 Then he spoke again

"Good. Alright. Now I need you to tell me what happened" 

I then told him a summary 

"We moved here a few days ago and ever since this thing has been hot on our trail. It's made sure we aren't able to contact help or leave. And the last time I encountered it was when it snatched my son and took off." 

"Well that's unfortunate. What's your name" 

he says while he takes out a cigarette and lights it nonchalant 

I grit my teeth again and say "I don't have time for let's get to know each other that thing has my son and from what I've learned it seems I really don't have much time." 

"Fair enough" he musters
"Well luckily for you we're looking for the same thing. I need it. You want your son. So I say we team up and find this thing. I've sent some of my men out and haven't heard anything since our little meeting. I assume they're probably dead by now. Follow me." 

He says. Puffing his cigarette turning on his heels and walking away. We surface at a map in the tent he was just in and he points to the red dots on the map

"These are it's hot spots. We've tracked it to this very forest so far and haven't really gotten much done. It's killed several of my men already so I assume our chances of all of us getting out of here are slim to none. But. If we can outsmart it. Then we may have a slight chance. Grab some gear and we'll head on our way." 

We began walked into the never ending forest once again. I don't know why he wants this thing but I don't really care. I just want to see my son alive. So I follow cautiously. 
We walked on for a while until we started trailing the blood scattered about the forest floor. 

"We're close" he says

Then sure enough as if it heard us. an inhuman screech rung out amongst the trees. My heart felt as if it just downed a can of four red bulls. But I kept my composure.  

I raised my gun and the man did the same. 
Ready to face whatever this was. 
And then I saw it. 
 Hunched over making a full coarse meal of what I can only assume was one of his men. 
It was disgusting. It's arms longer than it's body. Long legs creased in a squat. Skin grey and rigid falling away with it's spine sticking out inches from it's back. Black stringy hair covered it's face. Sloshing disgusting wet squelching as it devoured it's catch. It happily ate away at the man's carcass with gluttonous ease. 

The suited man rose his gun and shot 4 times into it's back. it screeched an unholy sound so loud it was damn near deafening. And it lept into the air and up into a tree. Then fell limp from 8ft and smashing into the ground with a cracking thud. 

"Is it dead??" I asked out of breath at what I had just witnessed

"Not hardly" he answered
"But its knocked out cold for the moment. Tranquilizer bullets" he lifted his gun and smirked proudly
I sighed then started calling for Jesse. 
My heart lept for joy when I heard a weak muster of 
"Mom?" 
I ran the the trunk of the tree and found a hulled out hole in the ground with Jesse wrapped in a wet slimy substance. I ripped it open and pulled my son free. 

Meanwhile the suited man took out chained handcuffs and cuffed the creature.
He then pulled out his radio and phoned a chopper then patiently waited for his ride to arrive. 

I held my son close. He was breathing shallow but I knew he'd be okay now. WE would be okay now. 
He staggered for a moment then started to walk upright. 

"Ma'am" the suited man called out to me. 
"Thank you" I nodded 
He smiled then spoke again
"Oh and one more thing" 
I turned to look at him 
And everything flashed and then went dark. 

I awoke with sweat and tears in my eyes. Heart racing. Breathless. I nearly broke my neck getting out of bed and ran to my son's room only to find him sleeping soundly in his bed. 
I sighed then walked down stairs. 
"Was it really all a dream?" I murmured to myself
"Stress must really be getting the best of me" 
My temples throbbed
I walked over to the window to see that it was quite pleasant outside. I peered down to the window sill and saw three scratches. 

"Huh. Must've been an animal trapped in here. Hope the little guy got out" 

I Then peered back outside. 
 and stood for a moment
"Hm" 
"I think I'll take a walk"

Then off into the yard I went. Down the rickety steps. Around to the back yard. And down the nice little path behind the house. 

And off into the woods.

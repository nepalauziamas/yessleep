I first started sharing my story two days ago in the post titled [Feathers in the Attic](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/vngwif/feathers_in_the_attic/), and yesterday I posted an update called [I know why the caged bird kills](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/voa3x0/i_know_why_the_caged_bird_kills/). Be sure you’re up-to-date with my ~~living hell of a life~~ story before reading further. Thanks!

I turn to face my bedroom door, feeling a bit like a toddler whose night light just died in the middle of a midnight storm. My fear is laced with nostalgia. The countless nights spent in this house of horrors. The incessant noise of the wings. It’s all something I’ve taught myself to forget, to explain away, but it never quite left me. This dread is muscle memory.

I wait for something else to happen, for the laugh to repeat. I try to find the courage to make some sort of move. My body is in statue mode, waiting for the dangers in the house to pass on their own as they always did when I was younger, but something tells me things are not so simple now.

The hallway light continues to flicker and the silence in the house feels manufactured, like the pin-drop quiet before a final act of a really good play. The type of event Jonah might take me to, if I ever see him again.

Something rough brushes my ankle and I snap out of my stupor, jumping in alarm as I twist my body to escape. My right foot lands wrong on the second step, and I hear a nasty snap of the ankle as I tumble down the dark stairs. My flight is rapid, and I try to grab at the walls to slow the fall. My left knee takes the brunt of the landing, causing me to break out in a series of anguished wails.

I try to lift myself off the landing, but my injuries have a sick symmetry to them, the pain flaring up in playful tandem, teasing between my right ankle and left knee cap. I can’t decide whether to laugh or cry, knowing my defenses are now entirely made up of my upper body strength. I manage to push myself up to a sitting position and lean against the nearest wall.

*Did something actually brush my leg?*

It’s dark, but the light from upstairs illuminates the entrance hall just enough for me to plan an escape. I waste no time in dropping to the floor and using my elbows to pull myself through the old newspaper piles, straining to see the door through the rising dust as I slide over the crinkling filth.

I am almost there, almost out, when a desperate thought hinders my escape. The object from my dad’s drawer. I don’t have it. I must have dropped it when I fell down the stairs. I turn back, my elbow pads now a bloody mess of carpet burn and mildew. Frantic, I run my eyes over the dark floor. I can’t see it anywhere.

I lift my head to glance at the stairs, and shrink back. I have been lulled into a false sense of security by the silent house. As I look up, I see two bare human feet walk into view at the top of the staircase. Everything above this person’s calves is obscured, but I can see enough to know there is something very wrong with how they’re walking.

It’s like all the bones in their feet have been snapped and altered in position, their debris moving under the skin at jagged angles. I feel sick, watching the ankles slip and slide out of place as they reach the step where I dropped the object. I still can’t be sure of exactly what I was holding, but it looks like some sort of notebook. Maybe a journal. The broken feet stand next to it, one on either side, teasing me to make a move.

“Ava?” a muffled cry barely reaches my ears as I resume my slow escape. I don’t recognize the voice and it feels like it’s coming from another planet, reaching my ear drums through countless balls of cotton.

My strength runs low as I reach the door and try to pull myself up to open it. I get about halfway, pressed up to the cold splintered wood that digs into my face as I reach for the handle. Before I do, a sharp force hits my forehead from the front, knocking me back.

A flurry of beeps and a strong chemical smell are what bring me back. I am lying somewhere soft and comfortable, a little cold but in a good way. Before I open my eyes, a dark sort of joke plays out in my head. I assume I’m at a hospital, but when I open my eyes, I’ll learn that I’m actually in some sick bastard’s basement, waiting to get chopped to pieces. A small laugh rises in my chest and is instantly stifled by intense shooting pains that ripple through my upper body.

I open my eyes to see that I am in a hospital room after all. Jonah is splayed out awkwardly in the nearest visitor’s chair, using his tattered old backpack as a pillow. He is ugly sleeping, with drool bubbling at the corner of his mouth every time he takes a deep snore. This is how he sleeps during exam week, when he’s absolutely exhausted.

I cringe in guilt as I think of the immense amount of shit I’ve put him through by ignoring his calls for a week. He is afraid of flying, so he must have driven here, barely sleeping. I wonder how he found me, but it probably wasn’t that hard. After all, I spent eighteen whole years of my life in this tiny town. He could probably walk into any supermarket, tell them my last name, and get a napkin map drawn leading him straight to the house.

I try to move my body and it’s a really, really bad idea. So much hurts. From my head, to my back, to the damned knee and ankle. Physically, I am absolutely destroyed. Emotionally - I am vindicated. I am not crazy. It was not psychosomatic. It is all real and always has been.

“Oh thank Mary you’re awake,” Jonah wet-mumbles in disorientation as he sits up too quickly in the chair, “I was so worried Ava, what the actual hell is going on?”

I am thankful for my beat up condition just then, because I truly don’t know how to answer. How much can I reveal without being shipped off to the psych ward? I wrack my brain for the right words, pretending to be in too much pain to speak.

“It’s all gone a bit wrong,” I finally croak as Jonah’s eyes search mine for a more satisfactory answer.

“I just don’t understand,” he leans back in the visitor’s chair, digging his fingers into the frayed arm rests, his dark blue eyes running up and down the tile patterns on the floor, “I thought you came here to see your sister, to bury your mother, and to aid the police investigation by telling them everything you know about your father. Instead, you ghost the hell out of me and everyone who cares about you back home.”

Jonah pauses to do a long exhale exercise he learned from one of the psych-influencer accounts he follows. Although I care for him a lot, I do not enjoy these dramatic displays, and I’m not loving how he is making my recent trauma about him.

“And when I do finally make it out here,” Jonah continues, “I find that there has been no service for your mother, no one knows where your sister is, and the police are still looking to speak to you. After which I literally drive around trying to find you for days, only to knock you out with the front door of your childhood home. Please help me understand. I know my tone is pointed right now because I’m tired, but I honestly just want to know what happened and how I can help.”

I look at Jonah’s thick, dark hair and the sharp line of his jaw. His long neck leads way to prominent, broad-shoulder collar bones and I think of how my stomach set aflutter the first time I saw him. I struggle to feel even a hint of that magic as I look at him now. And it's not his fault. It's this place, my old reality. It's where beautiful things come to rot.

My boyfriend of nearly three years is waiting for an answer, but I just withdraw. I don’t know what to say, and luckily I don’t have to think about it for long, because someone knocks on the door to my patient room. Jonah jumps up and lets them in, apparently recognizing the uniformed officer that enters. He looks familiar to me too, though I can’t quite place him. Something about small towns makes everyone look the same. I probably went to school with a cousin or sibling of his. Someone with the same white hair and wide nose.

"Miss Fugler, we have been trying to get ahold of you for a while now," the officer walks to stand at the foot of my bed, "I am detective Kleimer and I am the lead investigator on your mother's case."

I want to say it's nice to meet him, but I don't have the capacity to lie right now. I nod in silence, already dreading whatever comes next.

"We have finally determined the cause and approximate time of your mother's death," he continues with little emotion to his voice, "the state laboratory has established cause of death to be blunt force trauma to the head from an unknown weapon. Time of death is approximate, but narrowed down to about twenty-four months ago."

A numbness spreads through my aches and beatings as the horrible reality  of this man's words sinks in.

"How is that possible?" my voice rings high, "My mother disappeared over a decade ago."

"That's what we are trying to figure out," detective Kleimer says, pulling a state-issued notepad from his shirt pocket with one hand, clicking a ball pen with the other, "We are trying to establish a timeline of your mother's whereabouts since she went missing, as well as a list of suspects with incentive to harm her. We need to talk to both you and your sister about your mother’s disappearance."

"A list?" I practically snarl, feeling my damaged ribs crack to the tune of my rage, "Are you kidding me? It's my father, the man you have in custody. There's no way it could be anyone else."

"Actually, with the new timeline and evidence we’ve uncovered, we no longer have enough probable cause to hold your father," detective Kleimer furrows his brows as he deals the final blow to one of the lowest days of my life.

"We will be releasing Finch Fugler from custody by the [end of the week.](https://www.reddit.com/r/peculi_Dar/comments/vnkyf3/feathers_in_the_attic_series_hub/)”

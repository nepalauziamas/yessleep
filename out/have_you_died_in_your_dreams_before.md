Dying in your dreams that really a common thing most of you had a dream of falling from a high building but 

you always wake up before you hit the ground but for me I have continued after that 

All of this started when I move to my new house in Cairo In the center of the city. 
 
A new house , new memories, new city .

I was excited about it so much that , that my mother felt it strange as she said: "aren't you going to miss your friends " 

I responded :"this is the 21 century I can text them any time " she smiled to me and said what a time we live in 

And before I respond she said :"oh here we have reached our new home "
I looked at the new house with eyes full of happiness 
My mam tapped my shoulder and said "aren't you going to say anything."

I took a breath and said " home sweet  home "

I was happy and I didn't know what will happen in the week after .

This whole city was new to me but one time when I was lost and i asked for the way to my home I asked a man seems to be in his 30s 
And when he heard my address he said:" you don't really know the way to the baron palace " 

I asked him :"what is this place I don't know it "

He said :" then you don't know the rumors about this palace ,fine I will tell you this place have been knowing for a long time that it's a place where satan worshipers gather to make their rituals wich made by a sacrifice " 

I said while I am trembling:"what is the Sacrifice???"

You really don't guessed it he said 
It's human giving as a sacrifice to satan 

For money , power , highness they will kill even the children 

I heard all of this in disbelief saying:" why my new home is near those monsters " as I was thinking the man give me the directions I went to my way home  but i stopped in front of the palace for the first in  front of the palace for the first time in fear

I suddenly heard someone saying behind me saying :hey kid how are you ?

I shouted for help :"someone help " 

He said : hey ,why are you shouting 

As I heard the voice I become calm as it was my neighbor Gamal 

He calmed me down and said to me you seem pale let me go with you to the home but first tell me why you was afraid like this .

I told him what the man told me,then he said :"it's just rumors my guy don't be afraid "

I felt comfortable and said yeah that's right it's just rumors 

After that I went home , had dinner, and I went finally to sleep. 

It's just me now in my dreams 

Wow what is this place? 

Where am I?  

Am I in a palace , this must be a dream 

"It's my dear friend " these words just make me about to faint , I looked around but there was no one there until a single candle lights in the darkness of the room 

I said :"hello who is here "

And the voice said :"nothing more than his servant "

I asked where are we ? 

He said moving towards me :"welcome to the baron palace "pointing a Lance towards my chest and saying :" and you my friend  is the Sacrifice for our lord satan
In this moment I had no choice the only thing is running away from him running any where but when I enter a room I return to the same place and he just waits me laughing saying it's about time for you to surrender.

Talking with a musk of gold on his face laughing and saying to me don't worry you won't feel anything 

I really surrendered as he kept going after me and finally I sit down and accepted my fate then he come to me and say :"any words " 
And I said make it quick I can't see you well in the dark so, I won't run away 
I took my last breath while he is pointing with his Lance and with no mercy he strikes 

But he didn't hit me he hit my reflection in the mirror the shattered glass scratches his hand leading him to leave the Lance and with no hesitating I took the Lance and strike through his chest at this moment I wook up crying 

My mom came to ask me what happened I told here nothing just a nightmare, at that moment I heart crying outside the house and when I asked people gathering outside what happened they told that gamal is dead 
And that it seemed he was killed by a sharp thing looks like an old Lance.

Regardless of how mundane the world may seem throughout your daily routine I promise you, it's not.


There are things that walk, crawl, slither and fly among us that shouldn't exist, I kill them. 


My name is Colter Fray. It's my job to capture or kill (depending on the case,) beings of myth and folklore.


I started this thread to raise awareness, by telling you about some of the things most of you believe are only fiction. I'm not sure how long I'll keep it going. I guess It depends on how many people read it.


I'll start with the one I'm sure you're familiar with, Bigfoot. Now, the first thing I want to clear up is that there's more than one. It's not some mythical creature, it's a damn near extinct species thanks to us humans.


                 Entry 1: Bigfoot


I ate breakfast and allowed myself a moment to enjoy the sunrise while drinking a hot cup of black coffee at a diner in Georgia. Then I opened my laptop and got to work. It doesnâ€™t take long to find a case once you know what to look for.


Apparently there have been multiple sightings of Bigfoot in Tennessee lately. After digging deeper, I discovered a post on social media showing an image of two local men decked out in hunting gear in the woods who claimed to be tracking it.


This was concerning because their population has dwindled drastically ever since the Patterson-Gimlin film. Which was when the general public first became aware of the species' existence in 1967.


I pulled out my wallet, placed a 20 dollar bill on the table and left the diner to start heading towards Tennessee.


After a long drive, I reached the area in the Cherokee National Forest of the sightings. I turned on my satellite phone and put it in my pocket so that I could call May, my contact inside the organization once I've dealt with the beast, then jumped up inside the bed of my truck to grab the barely used tranquilizer gun out of the tool box.


Cases like this, capture cases, are rare. Most beings I go after aren't peaceful, and require lethal weapons.


It must've rained heavily before my arrival. The forest air was thick, hot and humid. I found it very difficult to stay silent while maneuvering through the thicket due to the wet, muddy ground beneath my boots.


I left no stone unturned as I searched the area all day long for any sign at all of the large ape's presence and found nothing.


The sun was about to set. I was drenched in sweat and irritated that yet another case would be added to the ungodly long list of hoaxes that plagued this beast's file.


It wasn't until I turned around to begin the long hike back to my truck that I finally spotted something. Directly in front of me, maybe six or seven feet away was a tree, with brown hairs pinched throughout a portion of its bark. I smiled as I made my way over to examine it.


A Sasquatch will sometimes press their back against trees like this to scratch an itch. Finding this told me two things.

One, the sightings were real and a Sasquatch actually is, or at least was, in the area recently.

Two, I need to find it before the locals who are hunting it do.


Thankfully, since I'm on It's trail now, I can start tracking it.


Several long silent hours passed. Now a flashlight and the full moon are the only things that light my path as I continue quietly moving forward trying to catch up with a giant that is capable of moving In almost complete silence. Then suddenly, as if I crossed an invisible barrier with my last step forward, I caught my first whiff of the ape's awful odor, I grinned. I was getting close. 


A few steps later, a man's yell broke through the silence to my left.

"I told you Jim, there it is!" 


Then a shot was fired, I ran towards the sound. making it around 50 yards away from them before they stopped cheering long enough to hear the mushy splashing of my footsteps which forced me to take cover behind a large tree. 

"What the hell was that?" Said the middle aged burly man who's name was apparently Jim, in a hushed whisper yell.


I peeked out and saw their rifles lined up directly at the tree shielding me.


I shook my head and slightly chuckled under my breath at the thought of how lucky these bastards were.


Like I said earlier, in most cases the beings I go after are bloodthirsty monstrosities that require lethal force. These two were lucky enough to get caught in the middle of a capture case. If it wasn't, I wouldn't have a choice, since they're armed I can't get close enough to subdue them. So I would have to kill them. But since this is a capture case, I was armed with a tranquilizer gun. I looked up and seen that the tree had many large, strong looking branches.


"Come on out from behind there boy, what the shit are you doin' out here," Not Jim yelled.


As his sentence ended, his friend collapsed onto the wet forest floor beside him. I watched as he looked down in disbelief, the man didn't get a chance to react, while he was looking down at Jim, processing what just happened, I fired one into his neck and watched as he fell, landing on top of his partner. I climbed back down from the tree that I had ascended moments prior during their confusion to my presence.


I made my way over to where the Two men now laid. I raised the rifle to scan the area through the mounted scope and scowled when I found the big guy, his hairy massive body appeared to lay lifeless on the ground.


I called May to arrange transport and requested for one of our specialized veterinarians to be sent out with them. While I made my way over to the sasquatch.


When I reached him, I noticed that 'he' actually turned out to be a 'she', and She was massive, no doubt the biggest female squatch that I've ever seen. She had to be at least 8'5. I checked to see if she had a pulse, and was shocked when I found that she did, however it was very faint.


I pulled the rag from my back pocket and applied pressure to her wound and that's when I realized... That she was pregnant.


A mixture of emotions coursed through me. Anger, because of those fucking hunters, sadness, because this peaceful girl never bothered anyone. she did not deserve this.


I began to hear the helicopter, echoing along the ridge.

"Stay with me girl, they're almost here you're gonna be just fine."

When it landed, two specialists rushed over to examine her. I backed away to give them room to work and Hoped that they'd be able to save her. My satellite phone began ringing. I looked down at my bloody hands and wiped them off on my jeans before pulling the phone out to answer. It was May, she was just letting me know that my fee transferred successfully.


I stayed until they got her safely loaded onto the helicopter, then I started the long hike back to my truck. 


Next time I'll tell you about a few of the more sinister beings that I've had to take out. I started with this one not only because it's the most known cryptid, but also to let you know that not all of these mysterious creatures are malicious. Some are simply misunderstood, some just want to be left alone.


This post is getting pretty long so I think I'll end it here. Stay safe out there.

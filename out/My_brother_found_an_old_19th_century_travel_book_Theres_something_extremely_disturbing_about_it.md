"Have you read the book, Norassa?" 


A question my brother, Timothy asked. It was an odd question, particularly since it was left as message on my phone. It was plain, simple question but one that would lead to ruin. 


There was no call from Timothy, the day I received his peculiar message. I checked on my phone's log. It was just the envelope icon, there displayed, as if it was taunting me to open it. 


Norassa, a name foreign, alien to me, yet familiar. 


"Norassa." I said aloud, staring at my phone. As the word left my mouth, a vison came flooding in. Bright yellow sands, crystalline blue water, craggy cliffs and atop the cliffs a city colored black. I'd been there, somehow, deep down I knew Norassa. 


I called Timothy, on the third ring he answered. 


"It's an old travel book, like really old," Timothy answered as if he already knew what I'd ask.


"Like those pictured travel books, dad use to have. You know the ones that were popular before the internet? This, this book is like early 19th century old, James. Full colored hand drawn maps, it is a thing of beauty. There's some chared pages, here and there. It as if someone tried to burn this beauty. Norassa, it feels familiar, doesn't it? Tell me it is not just me, James"


"You mean like we've been there, right?" I asked Timothy. 


"Yes," he said in excitement." Exactly what I thought, too. It's like a long forgotten memory, the yellow, almost white sands. I can smell the sea air, just thinking about it."


"Where did you find the book?" My curiosity, had peaked. As he spoke, bits of memory came back. I remembered playing in the sand, building castles in the shadow of the black city. 


There was maybe a minute of hard static. Timothy was speaking but I couldn't make it out. I believe he said something about that black city from my memory, something about a tower or something about a king. I could not make it out, nothing but a garbled mess. As quickly as the static came, it left. 


I could hear Timothy, again. His voice was now a high pitched shrill. 


"Imogarlop is waiting." 


Then Timothy hung up. I tried to call back, the phone, rang and rang, no answer. 


Several weeks went by, Timothy had not returned my calls. I had all but forgotten about his strange call. I woke up, one night, in a sweat. My head was hazy with a visage of a black city. Norassa, consumed my mind.


Had I dreamed of Norassa? The yellow sands and clear blue water, the faint smell of sea salt. My stomach turned as my vision became clearer. The craggy, shale grey cliffs rose from the shoreline. Norassa with its black obsidian walls, burned into my retinas. Towers, blacker than the city walls, rose high above Norassa. The towers twisted in perverse, unknown shapes. Somewhere, in those towers, I knew Imogarlop slumbered. 


I could not sleep, the rest of the night. I revolved to call my father that morning. Maybe, I thought, he knew of the place called Norassa. 


"Hello, James," my father greeted when he answered my call " what a pleasant surprise. It's not your mother's birthday, or a holiday." 


There was a slight sense of sarcasm in his voice. 


"No." I cracked a smile at that.


"Do you need money?" My father's tone shifted, this time had turned serious. 


"No, no, Dad. I had a question." 


"Well out with it, James"


"Okay. Timothy called me the other day. We both seem to have this strange memory. Maybe we vacationed here at some point, I don't know. Does Norassa ring a bell?"


There came, a pause, that seemed to go on for days. 


"Where did you hear that name?" My father's voice now audibly shaken. 


Before I could tell him, he continued. 


"Did, did your mother tell you about this?  Did she put you up to this? I swear I've never told anyone about that place. Listen to me, James, tell no else about that place, it's damned."


Before I could ask more, my father continued. 


"Dale, your uncle, had read about Norassa in a book or that's what he claimed. I don't know the name of the book, he never told me. Something about a king and a play that can be never performed. The play, he told me, causes people to go insane. Dale really liked the name, Norassa, it had almost become an obsession for him."


"We were about ten at the time, James. We were dumb kids. Norassa evolved and got intertwined with our playtime. It was all fiction or so I thought. We had wild imaginations, Dale and I. Pretending we were brave knights battling dragons and fighting through the black walled city of Norassa. We imagined a horrific beast of a monster had ruled the city. Imogarlop, The Unspeakable, Dale had called the thing." 


"We grew older, my imagination, shifted to school work and my efforts to get into med school. Dale slacked off in school but never forgot about Norassa. He had notebooks filled with drawings of the black city and Imogarlop, The Unspeakable. He was talented and probably could have become a respected artist." 


"The images of Imogarlop, still haunt me to this very day. The crown of bone, blood and skin he wore. I remember the eyes, hundreds of them they all seemed to be staring right at me." 


"Dale was drafted into 'Nam, I lucked out and got a full ride to med school. After the war, Dale wasn't the same. They called it shell shock back then. He just couldn't shake the demons. He ended his life, July 19th 1985." 


"Dad, who's Dale?" I asked, I finally got a word in." I thought, you were an only child." 


Another silent pause, then he spoke again, without acknowledging me. 


"Dale had something on his person, when he died, James. A worn black leather book, embossed on the cover in gold letters read, Norassa. I kept the book hidden, in my desk drawer. There was something about the book. An urge to read it, I had to read it. Yet, there was something holding me back. A primal feeling, that book was no good. "


"I had dreams for weeks after his death. I had ventured into the city. All Norassa's citizens, stared at me, they all pointed to the tallest of the towers in the city's center. All of them, spoke with one voice, in unison; 'Imogarlop Waits.'


"I tried to burn the book, James. I tried to rid myself of the damned thing. I couldn't take it, so made a fire and threw the thing in. In the flames the book flipped open, I saw beautiful colored maps. Hand drawn like they did centuries ago. By instinct, I pulled the book out of the fire, I fanned it off. If it was at that point I realized, the book had graves a hold of me.  I knew I had to get rid of it. There was something wrong about it. I knew my dreams had a connection, somehow. So I found a used book store, several hundred miles away that bought the book for ten dollars. 


"It was cheap, I know but I had to rid myself of it. I knew if I sold it to a closer book store, I'd try to get my hands on it again."


Confusion, rushed over me. 


"I don't understand," I said. 


The hard static, like from Timothy's call, returned. I couldn't hear a word, my father said. It was all unintelligible garble. For a brief moment, through the garble, I could hear Timothy's voice very clear. 


"Imogarlop is waiting."


The call, then, disconnected. I tried calling back, like Timothy before there was no answer. I did, the only thing, I could think of to do. I called Timothy. 


This time he answered on the first ring, as if he was waiting. 


"Meet me at Whitney's Diner," was all he said before he hung up. 


I didn't even hesitate, I got in my car and drove to the diner. Whitney's wasn't anything special. It was trailer designed with attempts to appear like a 50's era diner. The diner was a grease trap but a favorite among the locals none the less. 


As I walked in, Timothy was in the far back booth, his back to the front door. When I got the table and sat down, I realized something terribly wrong. His hair was a matter grey mess. Deep bags and dark circles around his eyes, he looked as if he'd been crying for days. 


He just stared me, until he pulled a book from his jacket and placed it on the table. It was a black worn leather book with embossed gold lettering, Norassa. I noticed his right hand as it lay on top the book. Eyes, someone had drawn eyes in various shapes and sizes all over his hand. 


I reached out and his retracted before I could his hand. 


"The book is yours now. I'm sorry, the book made me do it," that was all Timothy said as he got up. I tired to stop him, I tired to get him to stay but it was too late. Timothy walked out of the diner, down the stairs and into the busy street. 


The police report labeled it was suicide. There was no intoxicants in his body. My father shot my mother after I got off the phone with him. He then downed a bottle of sleeping pills with some vodka. 


There is only me now, and that damned book. I'm having horrible dreams of Norassa. Dreams of the citizens calling me, pleading with me to climb the tower. There is only one thing left for me now and Imogarlop is waiting.

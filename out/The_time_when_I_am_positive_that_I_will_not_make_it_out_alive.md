 CONTEXT: This takes place in 2011, I was signed up by PLAGF (People's Liberation Army Ground Force) as a part of the United Nations Peacekeeping Operation in South Sudan.  


This happened around May, near the end of the month. One night, I was doing my night shift at our post. I was the only one at that time since the other person went to facetime with his family.  
Our First lieutenant was super chill, just 1 person have to be present, while 2 is recommended. I saw a beam of white light, which is super confusing as the nearest village is abandoned for god-knows how long. So I acted like nothing happened, and decides to rest my eyes for 1 minute. During that rest, like 38 seconds in, I heard a scream. Like a full-on panic scream coming from a kid.  


Now, at this point, I am super creeped out. As soon as the other dude is finished with his face time, I called him in while I take a water break. As I was walking back to the post, I got a walkie-talkie call. Now, thankfully all the resting troop's walkie is turned off, otherwise, everyone won't be sleeping that night.  


In that talk, I heard the dude asking me questions like "Can you come to the post? I need you to hear this." Of course, I responded with "You talking about the scream?" He replied, "You heard it?" Now at this point, I know I wasn't the only one that is going crazy or having a mental problem. So I went to the First lieutenant with the dude and asked him about the village.  


Now, if one person asked him, he of course wouldn't care. But 2 people, plus they are on guard? He will have to do something. Now when he heard us complain, he thought we were joking. We asked him to guard with us, to which he agreed. We were on guard for around 3 minutes, he was about to walk away as he told us to never prank him, he heard it.  


So now, 3 people have heard it. I asked him about the history of the village, which was unknown, he does not have an explanation for that as well. So I kindly asked him if I can take one of our squad's armored vehicles, Dongfeng CSK-131 (This was in 2011, so we do not have a 37mm autocannon. Instead, we have a 12.7mm machine gun that need to be operated manually.) I took the CSK-131 specifically since it is mine-proof, protects up to a 30mm autocannon, and when you use 'Fortress mode' the metal plate will be flipped down to "hug" the window, which can protect from AP 12.7mm machine gun rounds.  


He was hesitant at first but eventually agreed for me to scout. I took the keys from the first quarter and climbed into the truck. As soon as I fired the engine, I was greeted by the roaring of the Chinese Diesel V8 engine. As I drove out of the gate, the wind suddenly was blowing, like very hard. You can see sand particles flying, and other dead plants along with it.  


I went to the village, which at that time, was the scariest 3 miles I have ever driven, it took me around 23 minutes due to the terrible abandoned road, and dodging potholes. I was always on 2nd gear, so I can stop in time, or change lanes. I drove on the abandoned road since at least I won't have to worry about stuck in the sand, and other 'surprises'.  
As soon as I arrived there, I saw nothing. Just plain, abandoned road with abandoned/already collapsed huts there.  


So, I grabbed my QBZ-95 rifle and turned off the engine. I grabbed the keys, shoved them in my empty magazine holder, and hopped out. I was aiming my rifle around, I did not grab my sidearm since what can a 9mm pistol do? That is a spare (QSZ-92 for gun nerds).  
I was searching houses one by one, then I saw footprints, like fresh-newly created footprints molded in the mud, leading to a collapsed hut. So I went there, I was scared of course, because I am afraid of being knocked out. I approached it slowly, while looking both right and left, making sure no one is near.  


I approached the roof of the collapsed hut and lifted it, and I saw a kid, around 10 years of age, just hiding in there. That kid pushed me back, which I guess is a reasonable thing to do if you were in his position. So I grabbed my rifle's flashlight and pointed at my left arm, which has my Chinese flag, and the unit I'm in.  


The kid wasn't convinced, saying something I do not understand, so I turned around, and walked towards my truck. He followed, when I unlocked my truck, I opened the back door for him, and he got in. I hopped into the driver's door, and pointed at him, using my hand, I was able to ask if he is alone or if there are more people. He pointed to himself and gave me a '1', which I thought there was another kid, so I pointed towards it, and I said '1?' He shook his head. So I started the engine, and I was right at first gear so, towards the end of the village, I can turn my truck around, when I suddenly saw 3-5 adults, in the dark, with AKM.  


Now do not ask me how they got it. I was a little scared but thought nothing of it. But later, I was proven wrong. As I drove for around 4 minutes just exploring the abandoned village, out of nowhere, there are around 4 Toyota Tacoma-ish trucks behind me, with their high beams on.  


I thought nothing of it until I started hearing 'Fireworks going off'. Then I realized, we were being shot at. I stepped on the clutch to shift from 1st to 2nd gear and stepped on the gas pedal to the bottom. The car sped off, but it was too late. The one thing that I have on my mind is that thankfully, I am inside a CSK-131. If I am inside the EQ-2050, even though the acceleration is faster, I am sure those 50 caliber bullets will pierce the window, as the car does not have the metal plating for it.  


But it is not the time to celebrate, right as I am about to make a sudden right turn, I saw another beam of light. And sure enough, it was their re-enforcement. I asked the kid, who is screaming his heart out, why they wanted you. He wasn't responding, as he was still shivering from fear.  


I tried to use my phone to call for backup, but it got no signal. I am also lost, since I have driven like additional 10 miles, at around 58 MPH to try and lose them. There are multiple roads, and all seem to be similar in some way, so I am just, lost. I think I am far enough from the attacker since their trucks seem to be far enough. I pulled over, turned the lights off, and quickly explained to the kid about the signal. Since the radio is at the back, I told him with hand gestures that once there is at least 1 bar of signal, which I pointed from the 0 bar right now, he will knock on the window.   


So, with the Toyotas closing in, I decide to turn on the light, do exactly what they didn't expect me to, and sped off.   


Now, shifting from 2nd gear to 3rd gear works like a charm, and so does 3rd to 4th. But from 4th to 5th, it wasn't always as pretty. So I just kept at 4th gear, going 56 MPH, and I remember wishing for Norinco to upgrade the CSK-131 to make it so that the turret with the 12.7mm machine gun is remotely controlled.   


Now, around 20 miles in, these guys are not giving up. Instead, I think I angered them in some way. But then, I heard the kid scream, and pound the window. So I took my radio and sent an SOS Signal (Which consists of the Unit name, where the location, and why.) Since we do not know our location, I chose an open road, going from 50 to 32 MPH, and turned on my phone. I sent them my current location, and then, I heard the guard saying 'You need backup?' and to my surprise, it was the First lieutenant.   


So I immediately asked for re-enforcements, which right now, is around 2:30. I was expecting a 'are you sure' thing, but I did not get a response back, so I checked the radio status, and sure enough, it got no signal. I was pretty pissed off at this point, either the antenna is broken/damaged, or something with the internal of the radio. Either way, I cannot stop to check, as they are starting to shoot at me again.   


So I accelerated, of course, but one of them got in front of me, again, but, this time, boxed me in. This time, I saw a dude with an RPK was standing on the roof, firing, but did no damage. They tried to open the door, but it was locked. When they realized the door wasn't opening, they surrounded us.   


I thought of a way to piss them off, so I decided to flip them off and stepped on the gas.   


I was prepared for the bumper cover to break, but it was stronger than I was expecting. So, I plowed through 2 trucks and drove off. 

  
Then, I heard that kid scream again, and I used the radio for the SOS signal again, which was then picked up.   


I gave them my location, and they told me to turn around, as another unit with 5 troops is in, so I did. After around 10 minutes of driving at 50 MPH, I passed one of them. So, I turned around, and sure enough, the Toyotas started firing at them.   


Then, all of a sudden, since they aren't after me, they thought the other truck was me, I told them to turn around. I opened the hatch towards the machine gun area, and I fired at them.   


I shot their car and killed some of them. They sped off, and I followed the unit towards the base.   


There, we got the kid some food, and I asked a translator to ask him where his family was, and why he was by the abandoned village. Turns out, the kid's family was raided by other people, and he ran towards one of the collapsed huts.   


Hearing that story, makes me wonder. Wonder if that traumatized the kid.   


When I saw my First Lieutenant, I was ready to get punished as I did just got the car full of bullet marks on both the doors and everywhere else. But instead, he brought me some ramen and told me to rest as it is 3:47 AM.   


I then asked where the kid was, they said they would ask for permission to get that kid to a foster center, and that I should be going to the bunks to rest. I went to the bunks, but can't sleep. So I just lay there, thinking about what just happened, and wonder if these Toyotas will reappear as we have a supply restock for the villages that are across our location.   


It has been 12 years now, and I still wonder if that kid has a nice family and if he is graduated from school.

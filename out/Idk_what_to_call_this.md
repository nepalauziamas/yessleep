I found my cat in a dumpster a year ago on 07-26-21. He’s been the sweetest baby ever since. He randomly started attacking a few select people I brought over, I’d always put him up. The weird thing is he only ever attacked people in my life who later on severely hurt me. It’s almost like he knew. He loved my sister, but my sister brought over this friend that even I had a bad feeling about. 


He’d always go straight for the friend. Several spiritual family members have basically begged on their knees for my mom to stop letting my sister go around this girl. Every time my sister does, she becomes somewhat weirder. I’ve noticed her drawing ritual type structures all over things in her room. Mom plays it off as a phase. Recently he’s gotten to where when my sister will approach me, he stands in front of me and starts hissing. 

I’ve been hearing my sister recently mutter weird “chants” that’s all I can really call them. I hear enough to know they aren’t English, and at first I thought I was tripping massive balls when they sounded almost backwards. I noticed a weird light coming from her door, so being the nosy big sister I am, I cracked it open a little to peak through. She was on the ground, hands above her head, looking straight at the wall. 


There wasn’t anything that should’ve caused the lights coming through the bottom of her door. They was almost like flickering, like it was luring me in. Before I could even close the door her head snaps towards me in the most inhuman way I’ve ever seen. I’ve never seen a smile like this appear on anyones face, it literally reached her eyes. In a voice that wasn’t hers, she yelled “you aren’t safe anymore, you’re a goner” 


I’d never heard anyone be able to achieve how loud her voice was. I was for sure she woke our mom up. She didn’t, mom didn’t hear it, no one did, only me. I then shot up. It was morning time and I was in my bed. I went to go feed my cat, because I always care for him first. He was nowhere to be found. We have cameras outside, there was absolutely no footage of him escaping. We searched the entire house, even my sisters room, no traces. I tossed and turned that night, I finally managed to get to sleep. I awoke in the middle of the night to my sister standing over me. 


The same ungodly smile on her face. My body froze, this is my little sister. I grew up with her. She looked into my soul, and in the same ear piercing yell she screamed “I told yo. You ain’t safe bitch” I shot back up and it was the next day. My sister has been acting somewhat her usual self today, but I noticed she’s been watching my every move. Literally watching every single thing I do. My cat still hasn’t returned. 


Is she possessed? I don’t want to think that, but did this “girl” possess my sister? I’ve heard of stuff like this but it’s happening to me in my own life. The emotions I feel are so mixed.

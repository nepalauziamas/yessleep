“He’s got her. Oh, God, he’s got her.”

I sunk to my knees. The world reeled around me. *If he killed my dad…* I couldn’t bear to think of the horrible things he would do to my Ali. Tears stung my eyes. *I have no idea where they went. No way to find out. No way—*

The *Legend of Zelda* tune filled the room.

Slowly, with shaking hands, I picked up the phone.

**UNKNOWN NUMBER**

“H-hello?”

“Hello, Adam.”

My voice. The exact same tone and timbre. And yet… the restrained glee I heard in it was completely different.

“Alaric—I know everything. Please, don’t hurt Ali.”

“I’ll think about it,” he replied, casually.

“Please, don’t—”

“I think we should meet. Brother to brother. What do you say? At the old arcade, where we used to play together?”

I only remembered playing at that arcade alone.

“Only if you let Ali go,” I said, my voice shaking.

“I’ll think about it, brother.”

The way he said *brother* sent chills down my spine. “Please. Don’t do anything to her.”

“Hmm…” A pause. “*If* you’re willing to come here alone, no police, no Mom… then, *maybe,* I’ll give you Ali.”

Relief flooded me.

I pocketed the phone and looked up at Mom. She was frozen by the window. “What did he say?” she whispered.

“He wants me to meet him.”

Her eyes widened. “No! No, you can’t!” She grabbed my arm and clung to me, pulling me back as I tried to step out of the room. “He’ll kill you. And he’ll somehow get away with it. And—”

“He’s got Ali, Mom. I don’t have a choice.”

I ran down the stairs, then ducked into the basement. I opened our small gun safe and pulled out a revolver.

Then I said goodbye to my mother.

We hugged in silence on the driveway, to afraid to actually speak the words. Then, with one last wave, I peeled out of the neighborhood.

The arcade had been abandoned for at least a decade. Weeds popped up in the cracks of the parking lot, slowly crawling towards the building. Chunks of brick crumbled off the exterior and the windows were broken, shards of glass rising up like pointed teeth. A tilted, stained sign still read *Neon Arcade.*

Chain-link fencing surrounded the condemned building—but the gate hung open.

I pocketed the revolver. Then I walked towards the building, slipping through the gate. A raven *cawed* and took flight.

I entered the building.

The inside was dark. The only light came from a large hole in the the ceiling over an old Pacman machine. I slipped my hand in my pocket, fingers wrapping around the gun. “I’m here,” I called out, my voice echoing in the dust. “Now give me Ali.”

A strangled whimper from somewhere behind me.

I whipped out the gun and reeled around—but there was only darkness. Only rows of dusty old video games that would never see another player. Only a claw machine filled with moth-eaten animals, faded beyond recognition.

“Alaric!” I shouted.

A rustle.

And then Ali burst out in front of me. She stumbled into the aisle, her hands tied behind her back, a gag over her mouth.

I ran to her, untying her wrists as she cried behind the gag. As soon as they were free, I pressed my keys in her hands. “Run. Take my car. Get as far away as you can. And—”

She ripped the gag off.

“*He’s behind you, Adam!”*

I wheeled around.

I was looking at… me. Yet it wasn’t me. The man standing in the darkness of the arcade was the same height as me, with the same skinny build. But the way he stood so still, staring at me with gleaming eyes… that wasn’t me.

I’m not sure it was even human.

“Go,” I whispered to Ali.

“I can’t—”

*“Go!”*

She gave me one last, pleading look before running out of the arcade. I turned around to face Alaric—

The aisle was empty.

I reached into my pocket and pulled out the revolver. I held it in front of me, aiming, my hands shaking.

“Looking for me, brother?”

He was standing *right behind me.*

I was staring into my own blue eyes. Although, this close—with his face inches from mine—I could see slight differences. Just like in the photographs. His eyes were a hair too far apart. His cheeks were slightly thinner. He was missing the scar on my chin, that I’d gotten falling off a bike in fifth grade.

And then he grabbed me.

Pain shot through my body as he shoved me to the ground. The gun slipped out of my hands, skittered across the floor. His lips—*my* lips—twisted into a horrible smile. Before I could move, he was crouching down to the stained carpet, reaching for the gun—

“No!”

Ali’s voice.

*No, no, Ali—*

I lunged forward and grabbed the gun. “Ali, *get out of here!”* I screamed as I stumbled up. I whirled around, but I couldn’t see either of them. Rapid footsteps sounded in the next aisle—but I had no idea who they belonged to.

And then—silence.

“Ali?” I whispered, my voice shaking.

Silence.

“Alaric?”

*Thump.*

Motion caught my eye.

But what I saw in my peripheral vision was not Ali—or Alaric.

It was tall. Incredibly tall. Its fur, or skin, was pitch black—the color of the sky on a moonless night. Its arms hung at its sides, so long they nearly dragged on the floor. And its face… its face was a scrambled mess of human features. Several eyes, all different colors, blinking rapidly. Two mouths, oriented vertically. Opening like gills on the side of its face.

Then my eyes focused on it—and the creature instantly condensed into my own form.

I took a deep breath. Aimed.

And pulled the trigger.

*Snap.*

Alaric stumbled.

And then he collapsed. I ran over to him, panting, the revolver shaking in my hands. A stain grew on his chest—but it was a deep, colorless black. Not red. He looked up at me, with *my* blue eyes, and his mouth twisted into a smile.

“Brother…”

That was the only word he managed to get out before his eyes glazed over.

\*\*\*

It’s been almost six years since that day at the arcade.

Ali was waiting for me outside, unharmed. Despite the loud gunshot, the police never showed up at my door. But I did see a little article a few weeks later, tucked away on a local news website. Some urban explorers broke into the arcade and found tufts of fur and bones that weren’t easily recognizable. Being reasonable people, they’d turned the stuff over to the local cryptid society instead of, you know, a lab or something.

Now there’s a resurgence of bigfoot sightings in our town.

But life for us has been pretty amazing. Ali and I sold our house and moved a few towns over, to a rural little cottage nestled in the woods. And then we found out we were pregnant. Now we have an incredible four-year-old named Ava and two tabby cats, Anna and Elsa.

You can guess who named the cats.

Sometimes I think back to that day. What would have happened if Alaric killed me. Our wonderful little Ava never would have been born. Ali would’ve been a widow. Or—even worse—maybe Ali *wouldn’t* have been. Maybe Alaric, or whatever that thing was, would’ve come back home and pretended to be me.

Just the thought sends shivers up my spine.

“I’m going to bed,” Ali says, leaning over to kiss me. “Are you sure you can’t come up?”

“Nah, I have to finish this. It’s due on Monday and you know I’m not going to get any work done tomorrow, with my mom visiting and all.”

She grins at me. “Your mom is such a good grandma.”

“Ha. She spoils Ava a little, if you ask me.”

Ali laughs and heads up the stairs. I listen to her footsteps fade, then transform into the sound of creaking boards above me. I sigh and turn back to my computer.

It’s near midnight when I hear it.

*Thunk, thunk, thunk.*

Three knocks at the front door. Soft and polite. I frown, slowly getting up from my chair. *Did Mom decide to come tonight, instead of tomorrow morning?* She’d surprised us a few times like that before. But never so late at night…

I walk over to the door and peer through the peephole.

My blood runs cold.

It’s a little girl, standing on our porch. Hands tucked into her pockets, humming to herself. Smiling as she stares at the door. Dark hair, pale skin.

And about four years old—just like Ava.

\*\*\*

It was some time before Dr. Small returned to St. Katherine’s Orphanage. The children waited outside every morning for that black vehicle to come rolling down the driveway with it’s strange tall driver and unconventional Doctor. And each morning they returned to their lessons with a lack lustre brought on by disappointment. The first Tuesday in January came and passed, however no silent adoption took place that month. I joked bitterly with myself that even shadow demons took the holiday season off.

On the day of the funeral we dressed all the children in black and took a bus to the chapel. Dr. Small, much to my surprise, met us there. He wore a long black suit that contrasted uniquely against his light hair, his expression made of stone he paid no mind at all to me and I paid very little to him.

In truth I don’t know who told him of the funeral nor could I see any reason he should attend. Sister Helen was the eldest of us and had passed in her sleep, as far as I was aware, Dr. Small didn’t even know her. However, as Sister Mary wheeled Eric off the bus I understood

Eric wore an annoyed expression, as always he had wanted to walk, but Sister Mary had insisted he use the chair and was scolding him as she wheeled him along. She didn’t want him falling over during the service. Meanwhile Dr. Small looked surprised to see the boy. I saw the emotion play across his expression, astonishment turned to relief. Then his gaze came to rest on me, hatred lived there and I realised he must have thought I had kept news of the boy’s survival from him. 

In truth, I hadn’t exactly rushed to tell him. But it was not my fault that the Doctor had shown up, uninvited, to a funeral with the assumption that it was for Eric. I wondered briefly if the man would leave right away, however he stayed and sat silently in the church for the duration of the wake and service. Though I half expected him to spontaneously combust. 

Once it was all over and done with we began loading the children back into the bus. This is when Dr. Small approached me, “The boy survived.” He commented falling into pace with me. 

“Yes.” I answered simply, recalling the morning I had awoken with a start. I had fallen asleep against Eric’s bed during the night and initially I hesitated to check on him. I didn’t want to look up to see his corpse and so I had allowed myself a moment to remain purposefully unaware. I imagined that I could still hear him drawing laboured breaths.. and slowly I came to realise that I could hear him still breathing. He was alive. It was a miracle I was sure. 

“You neglected to write that he recovered.” Dr. Small accused. 

“And you neglected to instruct me to do so.” I retorted. 

He smiled at this, a cynical annoyed smile, “I see. Then  I won’t neglect to inform you that I will be escorting Eric back to St. Kathrine’s in my own personal vehicle today.”

I felt distaste in my gut, “His chair won’t fit in your transport.” I came up with the excuse quickly.

“He won’t need his chair, he will be seated.” Dr. Small responded in finality and so it came to pass that I watched the Doctor’s driver lift Eric into the back seat of the car. I don’t know what happened in that car. They drove ahead of us the entire way and when we arrived the Doctor helped Eric out the car. 

However, from then Eric seemed.. Different. He was far more reserved and I caught him awake late at night on several occasions, he sat staring out of his bedroom window. When I asked what he was doing, he responded that he wasn’t doing anything, that he just couldn’t sleep. 

Now of course I asked if the Doctor had touched him in any unsavoury way. 

“No?” He responded with such confusion that I believed him. I began to feel as though whatever had happened, I was significantly wrong about what it was. During the day he began to fall asleep while in lessons. As a result Sister Beatrice struck him with the back of a ruler so hard that it cut his knuckles, but he didn’t cry. He stared back at her with a vicious glare, it was almost, murderous. 

This wasn’t the first time Sister Beatrice had used such methods against the children, however, none had returned such malice before. I began to worry that the hatred Dr. Small spread had once again infected my child. For the time that the Doctor had been absent Eric had returned to a sweeter nature. Now that the man visited him daily, his mood was foul once again. 

There were many nights that I lay awake thinking about Eric. About his change in behaviour, about the change in his nature and about the way in which anger seemed to consume him little by little until there was almost nothing of him left. There are many nights still that I wonder what drove him to what he did. 

Of course I noticed some.. Unpleasantries in his life. The other children teased him, there were occasions were they would steal his brace. Other times were I believe they may have taken control of his chair to wheel him around, but I always found out before any harm came to him. Or perhaps I didn’t. Perhaps Sister Beatrice was too hard on him during her lessons.. I can’t say for sure. 

What I do know, is that night it happened is one I wish I could forget. A like to many other nights I awoke suddenly from my sleep, I couldn’t say for certain what it was that woke me, but I quickly became aware that smoke filled the air. I could see it swirling in the dim light coming in from outside and the bitter smell of it burned my throat. 

Immediately I began to panic, pulling on my robe I hurried to wake the others. I ran down the hallway shouting as loud as I could for everyone to wake up. I opened every door along the way, urging sleepy children to climb out of their beds and make haste out of the house. 

I hurried to Eric’s room, throwing the door open I found that he was not in bed. The other children in his room were there and starting to wake with varying levels of concern in their expressions. Working as quickly as I could I ushered many children out of that burning house. Each time I ran back in the smoke with thicker, I kept a cloth over my face to keep the smoke out but before long I was gasping for breath. 

Urgently I tried to find Eric, I began to see flames flickering at the far end of the hall. I couldn’t imagine why Eric would be there, but I had it in my mind that he had somehow fallen somewhere and was unable to escape so I continued to search. I wasn’t prepared for when I would find him. 

I reached the last door in the hall, it was Sister Beatrice’s room and the door was slightly ajar. Flames tickled the edges of the frame and the smoke was thick. “Eric? Sister Beatrice?” I called, pushing the door open. The fire danced wildly with the new oxygen and I took in the scene before me in shock. 

Eric stood in Sister Beatrice’s room beside the open window, he was relying heavily on his brace and it looked as though he were planning to jump out. He looked up in surprise when I entered. His clothes and hands were covered in blood, Sister Beatrice’s lifeless body lay on her bed with a kitchen knife plunged into it. It looked as though she had been stabbed several times, and her body was beginning to burn. The smell of burning human flesh is disturbing in an odd way. It smells a lot like any other meat, only you feel strange knowing that meat is someone you once knew. 

It’s difficult to describe the ways in which your mind tries to stretch all the facts to fit and make sense. I couldn’t quite comprehend what I was seeing.  Then I realised something strange, no flames touched the boy. They all stopped in a perfectly rounded circle and leant away from him. The floor there was darker, blackened. It was a shadow I realised, a shadow that was repelling the flames. 

In his free hand Eric held a candle and the curtains beside him seemed to be completely burned away. Had he set light to the curtains? Had he stabbed Sister Beatrice to death? I stared at him with was much astonishment on my face as he stared at me with. 

He looked at me, Sister Beatrice’s body, the candle in his hands and then back to me, “I didn’t-“ Eric started his eyes wide with shock, when a support beam from the ceiling gave way. Crashing into the room in a spray of sparks and eliminating any hopes I had of reaching him. 

“ERIC!” I called panicked, there was no way for me to get into the room and it was with reluctance that I turned to leave. I had intended to run for help, though I couldn’t imagine who could help me. Part of me knew it was a lost cause, while another part of me hoped still that he would leap from the window. 

I ran outside, the cold air stung in my damaged lungs. My plan at that point was to run to the other side of the home and urge Eric to jump from the window, I would catch him. That’s when the familiar black car came screaming up the drive. It pulled to a stop sending a spray of gravel. To my surprise Dr. Small stepped out of the drivers side and I rushed toward him. 

“Eric, he’s still inside..” I didn’t want to ask this man for help and I didn’t truly get the chance for he ran straight into the building without acknowledging me. I watched as the flames curled away from him just as the did away from Eric as he disappeared into the inferno. 

I waited anxiously with the other sisters and the children, it’s hard work to calm everyone down. In the background we could hear fire sirens approaching though I doubted they would be able to do much. The mansion was by this time completely engulfed in flame. I knew in the pit of my stomach that neither Eric nor Dr. Small would reemerge from such a fire.  

Another portion of the house collapsed and I screamed, there’s an agony in being completely helpless. Knowing someone you love is dead or dying and there’s nothing at all you can do to help. That’s when I saw the flames shimmer and a figure emerge from the fire. 

It was Dr. Small, he had not a mark on him and in his arms he was carrying something. A child, Eric. Though the boy was covered in grime and his clothes were slightly singed he did seem to be alive. I don’t know why I had expected that the man would carry Eric back to me. At the time I never considered that he wouldn’t.

However, Doctor Small carried Eric to his car instead and placed the boy in the back seat. Then he simply drove away into the night mere moments before the firetrucks arrived. I only saw Eric that one last time, his expression was lifeless. No spark, no anger, nothing. Like looking into a void. I relinquished my faith that day for the ‘god’ I worshiped never once helped. However, a man I firmly believe to be the devil saved the orphaned little boy I cared for and no faith can replace what I had seen with my own eyes.

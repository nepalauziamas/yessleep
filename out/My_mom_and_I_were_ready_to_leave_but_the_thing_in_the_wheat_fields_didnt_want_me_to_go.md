Growing up, the word ‘no’ was illegal in my house.

So, when my mom asked, “Isn’t there something you’ll miss about this place?” all I could do was hang my head and shuffle my feet. She sighed and shook her head and I slipped out onto the porch as quickly as I could. Nothing good came from that sigh.

Outside, I stared at the old windmill that turned in jerky starts. Behind it was the hazy midday sun, and then nothing else until the horizon. I stood out on this porch I would never see again and searched around for some emotion, some feeling that would tell me the only home I had lived in up until now meant something—but nothing came. Any regrets or woes I had were swallowed up in the jittery excitement of a dream coming true. Tomorrow we would start our new life in the city. Not the big city mind you, but big enough when compared to a shack trapped in the middle of nowhere, whose only neighbor for miles was a wheat field that stretched past what the eyes could see.

The wheat field I thought, or more precisely, the maze inside the wheat field. When my dad had planted the wheat, he was careful to leave paths between the stalks to make it easy to get from one side to the other. As a child, this had taken my imagination by the reins and driven it wild. I would often journey into the fields and take whatever turns I came across, acting as an explorer traversing a maze housing deadly secrets and perhaps a minotaur or something.
	
I looked back at the sun in the sky, then at my watch (the city kids would use their phones to tell time I had heard, so I hoped that my mom would get me one of those before school started) and decided a quick trip into the maze for old time’s sake couldn’t hurt. 

Happy now mom? I found something to miss about this crappy old place.

I went back to my room and dug through the “things to throw away” box and found my old maze explorer kit. It was just a tiny little pouch to the much older me but as a kid it had seemed a certified utility bag full of gadgets and tricks that any explorer would kill for.

I dove into the wheat fields and started taking turns as soon as I came to them. I was much taller now, tall enough that the wheat no longer towered over me as it had, but they were still huge and blocked out everything around me. I was in my own little world again, just like I had been so long ago. In this world, I didn’t have time to worry about what I would miss, or how different city life would be—if I dallied, the minotaur would get me, or I would get lost in the maze, or perhaps something even worse would find me… something as old as this farm, which had apparently been passed down for generations upon generations.

I explored for at least an hour and realized that I was now sufficiently “lost.” Of course, you could never actually be lost in a field of wheat. All you had to do was pick a direction and walk towards it and eventually you’d hit a road or the house or the far barn.

I was standing in a four-way intersection of sorts, where two different paths had converged and looked for where the sun bled through the wheat the brightest. I began walking in that direction. 

For the first hour, my thoughts were back onto mundane things. Tomorrow I would drive four hours to the city with my mom and I then I would never, ever have to come back to this place. Tomorrow I would see my new apartment for the first time and my new school the day after (a real school! No more home schooling for me). I hoped I would be able to make actual friends, and not just play with my poor cousin who hated this old farm nearly half as much as I did.

For the second hour, I tried to focus on something else, but worry began to seep in.

When the third hour was nearing its end, I found myself fighting panic.

I grabbed my explorer’s supply bag and pulled out the tiny compass my dad had bought me back when he first caught me in the wheat. I remember thinking he was mad (he was always mad about something) but he just quietly handed the compass to me and told me “you can never get lost with this. Find south, and walk that way, and you’ll always find your way home.”

But today the compass would not show me south. It spun wildly and then would stop, pointing in a random direction but anytime I would start lining it up with the “N,” it would start spinning wildly again. 

I turned and turned, tried to remember what direction the sun set in but with the wheat as high as it was (did it grow taller since I came in?) I couldn’t tell which direction it was even in. There was a black movement in the corner of my eye. The stalks rustled.

I stood, frozen, staring into the spot where several stalks of wheat gently rocked back and forth, as though they had been… disturbed. I tried to gulp with my dry throat and listened as closely as I could for a sound, but the wheat was still.

I looked at my compass, and too my surprise, the red arrow was pointing to S. It took me a long while to get my courage up, but I did start walking again. Right toward the spot where the black shadow had appeared so briefly. 

Just a trick of the light. The wheat moved because my bag hit it while I was spinning. But my bag wasn’t long enough to reach the wheat there and I knew it. I just pretended I didn’t.

As I walked, the wheat seemed to grow taller, and the shadows definitely grew longer. I was sure I was walking South now as the shadows stretched toward the east. But every shadow seemed to me to be watching me, poised to move. Poised to lunge. I walked faster.

My watch was strange now. I had been counting seconds to keep my calm but five minutes of counting had apparently cost me the better part of an hour. The wheat was still and quiet and the shadows harmlessly stretched longer but the sunlight was disappearing rapidly. I needed to get home and fast.

A sound again. This time from the east. I started walking so fast that it may as well have been running. The sound again, longer this time, from the northeast and it sounded like movement. I was running now, nearly sprinting and the sound increased in frequency. 

Behind me in the north, to my side in the west. Now the southwest. Now…

I stopped. The sound was in front of me now. Rustle rustle it said, and the wheat all around did just that. I was sweating wildly, and my breath was coming from me in gasping near-sobs. My heartbeat was loud enough to wake the dead but still I could hear it coming, getting closer and closer… I thought to run but remembered the pocketknife in my explorer’s bag. It had been another gift from my dad, a secret from my mom. One of so many secrets from my mom.

I had it out, the tiny blade at the ready just as night fell in full. In the starlight, I could make out a spot in the wheat before me where the shadows drew around something darker than the blackness of the maze. I held onto the pocketknife for dear life, but my knees were ready to betray me.

“This way” a voice said from my left. The voice was familiar, but that made no sense. I ran toward it anyway. 

Whatever had been in front of me was now chasing me. I could hear the sound of wheat rustling at first, and then it sounded like they were bending and warping. I looked back and sure enough, stalks were falling limp to either side in the wake of whatever was coming. I couldn’t see it, all I could see was that it was a shade of black so dark, it seemed to devour the moonlight and starlight that fell upon it.

It was getting close now. My legs were starting to faulter, I had never been an athlete. To my right, I heard the familiar voice again and I turned sharply just in time to hear the wheat around where I had been standing get sliced clean in half. I didn’t think I could run any faster but somehow, I did.

It wasn’t fast enough.

A cold, wet thing grabbed the back of my shirt. Fortunately, it was an old t shirt and a chunk of it ripped away allowing me to keep running. Unfortunately, I stumbled with the sudden movement. 

It grasped my arm and kept me from falling, then started to drag me backwards toward the wheat. I pulled and screamed and hit at it but my hand seemed to pass into nothingness and came out damp and hot and chilled numb. Just as my feet gave out and it started to drag me, I saw a light out of the corner of my eye, from just behind me. The thing let me go, and the familiar voice whispered in my c’mon kiddo, run.

I did.

I came bursting out of the wheat field drenched in sweat. I rolled across some grass and looked back to see the blackness “slam” into the wheat, which rocked forward like a wall ready to fall over—but the wheat held, and the thing stopped where it was. I saw it move back and forth as a shadow across the stalks at the very edge of the field, but it could not break through whatever threshold was there. Eventually, it stopped, and seemed to recede back into the wheat field.

I turned, wondering where I had ended up and I did a quick double take. I was on my dad’s favorite hill, overlooking the house, the wheatfield, and the rising moon which was already halfway through the sky. In front of me, just as it had been the last time I had come to this hill, was my dad’s grave. A simple mound with a cross stuck in it that said, “here lies -- --, a more dedicated man there has never been.”

“That doesn’t make any sense” I said, and the familiar voice, now next to me, responded.

“Kiddo, you’re gonna find that most things in this life don’t make sense.”

I turned. Bathed in moonlight, so much so that he looked to be projected from it, stood my dad.

“What” I said, and not as a question. He just nodded.

“You’re goin’ to the city tomorrow” he said.

“We are.”

“You’re gonna love it.”

“Ha. That doesn’t sound like something my dad would say. How do I know you aren’t that thing tryin’ ta—trying to get me?” I asked him.

He shrugged “you’re right, it’s not something I woulda said to you. But it is something I shoulda said to you. I loved this place” he said, looking down at the house “and I ain’t talkin’ about the wheat or that old shack, ‘cept maybe the ol’windmill. I loved it ‘cuz it was where the two of you were.”

“Oh” I said “you sure coulda fooled me.”

“Now though, the two of you ain’t gonna be there anymore. So I’ve got no real love for this place no more. Now, I can say with all my heart, you’ll do just fine in that big ol’city.”

“I doubt it” I said “You’ve seen the way I dress. I talk like you. I’ve never actually seen a smartphone! They’ll know I’m a bumpkin. They’ll call me a hillbilly.”

My dad laughed, and I finally believed that it really was him. He laughed so rarely, especially as he got older and his hair came out and his skin grew sallow… but it was one of the best sounds in the world. I started crying.

Dad made to pat me on the shoulder but stopped, then turned away. I thought I saw a tear in his eye too, but that was impossible. Even if he rarely laughed, he absolutely never cried. We stayed like that for a while, just under the moonlight, watching the home we had once lived in.

“By the way dad, what even was that thing?”

He shrugged. “No idea. Your great, great, great” he took out his fingers to help him count “great, great, great, great grandad wrote some old notes about how the guys he got this land from warned him about it. Says he got an exorcist to trap the thing. Didn’t say what kind of exorcist.”

“Well why didn’t you warn me about it?”

“’cuz I didn’t believe it existed! Your great grandpa and your grandpa never talked about it if they saw it. I only ever saw it on the night I… On the night your mom and you said you were movin’ to the city, with or without me.”

I got quiet at that. But thinking, I made a connection—“Is that what killed you?” I asked my dad.

He shook his head slowly at first, then faster. 

“Nah. I died exactly how you think I did. An accident, and an embarrassing one at that. Do me a favor, ya’hear? Tell your new city friends that I died fightin’ a bear.”

“There ain’t no bears around here dad” I laughed “only deer.”

“Then tell’em it was a real big deer. With antlers like a… a tree. Of knives” and he made a set of knife-tree-antlers with his hands on the sides of his head.

“Alright dad” I laughed. I sat watching my knees for a bit and then started “hey dad?”

“There you are!” my mom shouted from behind us. I turned to see her and noticed my dad was already gone… and so was the wheat field that should never have been there.

“I’ve been looking everywhere for you, what have you been doing?”

“Nothing mom, sorry to worry you.”

“I swear” she said, but she stopped and took a look at the scenery, then last at dad’s grave. “C’mon, let’s get you home. You still need to pack!”

The next day, I watched as the car moved onward and that old home—our home—disappeared into the distance.

“Mom” I said “I know what I’ll miss.”

“Oh yea? What’s that?” she asked, seemingly disinterested.

“The way dad used to laugh.”

Mom turned and looked at me then, although I wasn’t ready to look at her. 

“Yeah” she said in a thick voice “yeah. Me too.”

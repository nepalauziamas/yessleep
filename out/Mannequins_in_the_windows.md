I know this sub can have stories that are fictional but are meant to be accepted as true, but this is something that legitimately happens to me, as you can see it is rather mundane just a little creepy. I don't know if there is a better place for stories like this, but anyways, here it is:

Just before summer started my family bought a camp on a lake, as my dad loves to boat and fish and my mom likes to just hang out in the sun. For reference, I'm 17 and I have a slightly younger sister as well. Now that we have the camp we go quite frequently, pretty much every weekend. To get there we travel by car from our house and we can go on a whim as it is only about 45 minutes away. There are many camps around this lake, and it is almost like a circular town. I would say it's close knit because of how close in proximity all of the camps are, but pretty much everyone with the exception of one nosy neighbor keeps to themselves. There's barely any interaction between campers, although there are many people that come and go on their own and there are always a few boats on the water. There is a couple of small resorts, a theater, and a golf course right next to the water as well. A little more creepily there is a large spiritualist campground thing that lines the road that leads down to the lake, as well as most of the grassy/forest area just behind the houses right on the water. I don't know what exact belief system these guys are following, but they seem kinda off to most normal people, regularly participating in "message circles" and other hokey events. They also seem to have this karate training thing and I often see grown men fully decked out in those stereotypical white robes training together in the woods. They pretty much stay self contained in their declared neighborhood and sometimes meat in this small and decrepit shack-like building. I don't know if it is better furnished on the inside, but the outside looks really crappy and I' not sure what goes on in there, although I assume it's the message circle thing I mentioned earlier. The larger area/town this is all in is rather rural, civilization always nearby but many fields and forests in between. So yeah, that's the setting of this area just for your knowledge for the actual story.

Just before we turn onto the road that leads to our camp address, there is a small field to our left with a single house in it. The house is small, appearing to be what people call a trailer, and the outward appearance isn't in the best condition. The yard maintenance definitely shows that someone lives there, it's just the house that is kind of rundown. It looks like a typical home that someone who doesn't have much money would live in. The house has three windows that face the road, the ones to the right and left have blinds  that are always closed, but the middle window always has a view directly into the house. Well, it would if it wasn't always blocked by something really creepy. On one of the first drives down I happened to look over at the house and I saw a human figure plastered against the window; it's face was pressed against the glass with both hands pressed on the window higher up. It jumped me a little because  I wasn't expecting it. I only saw it for a moment but something about it just seemed like it wasn't actually a person. I told my sister and we made sure to pay attention next time we drove by. This time we both saw it and we agreed it had to be some sort of mannequin. It was in the same position as before, and I noted that it was of great quality. It actually looked pretty realistic as far as mannequins go, but it's dull face/expression showed that it was not an actual person just being creepy in the window.  Ever since then, my sister and I kept an eye on that window to see it. I believe we saw it one more time before something else weird happened. 

This time the mannequin had changed. I didn't give this thing a lot of thought, but I was sure it looked different from last time. It was in a similar stance and position, but the features/clothing and hair were definitely different. Keep in mind this was happening June through August, so we're no where near halloween for this to be a festivity decoration. I thought that it was strange that whoever lived in this house would take the time to change the mannequin in the window, and it suggests that they are purposely doing this and spending at least a little amount of time/money on these things for seemingly no reason other then to creep out random drivers on the way to the lake. I believe that it changed one more time on our next drive down (keep in mind we go down like every weekend, so these things are being changed out rather frequently, and always in strange clothing as well) and it became a strange mystery that my sister and I liked to discuss. By now my parents had seen it as well and agreed that it did look like a strange and pretty detailed mannequin, and my mom definitely thought that it was changing as well, although my dad hadn't given it enough thought to have any input on it. It pretty much became a tradition on the ride down to camp; what creepy mannequin was going to be positioned in the window this time? 

One trip down though it was suddenly gone. As always we looked through the center window of the trailer, but it was empty. No mannequin just a plain and empty room. It was really weird because a mannequin of some sort had always been in the window throughout the summer. Seeing it eerily empty, with the room having no other real features, almost added to the creepiness of the whole thing somehow. This lasted for perhaps one more trip and we were beginning to wonder if the whole mannequin thing had ended. The next time we looked through the window I saw the creepiest mannequin of all of them. 

This one wasn't plastered against the window in the way most of the others had been. Instead it stood upright at the window, however in a stance that was somehow even more ominous. It's kinda hard to describe, but just imagine that "eerie stand" that creepy characters do in movies and you should get what I mean. This one was dressed probably the most elaborately in a semi-fancy semi-weird dress, with a red thing over her face that I'm not really sure what it was. Kinda like a veil, but you couldn't really see through it, and it was much more rounder. It was semi-transparent but not as much as veils usually are, as I could barely make out that the mannequin had a face at all. It was circular in shape and covered the entire face, like a cloth red haze. I'm sorry if my description doesn't make much sense, but keep in mind I only see it for a few seconds as I'm driving past, and it was a few days ago at the time of writing. At this point the whole thing seems really weird to me and since I have an imagination I am pretty creeped out by this whole thing. We haven't been down to the lake since, so that's the last I have seen of it for now, although I'm sure we're going down again this weekend so I'll probably get another glimpse then.

To recap: there is a slightly crummy house in the middle of a field with all of the windows always closed except for one, which has a frequently changing realistic mannequin that is always dressed in some bizarre way and put in unnerving positions right in front of the window, which sometimes randomly disappears to show nothing but an empty room. 

So yeah, that's what I see on my way to camp. I've always felt a little creeped out by it, so please let me know what you guys think of the whole thing!

When I was about 9, my family and I lived in a small, rural town. Everyone was close, and it was such a tightly knit community that parents could trust their kids to stroll through the town without the worry of harm.

But, of course, there was one place everyone was wary of, and always avoided.

Mary Bones’ ranch.

Mary Bones was married to Henry Bones. She was said to be a housemaid, Henry a wealthy ranch owner. 

They were a happy couple before Henry’s death.

Henry was found dead in the pasture, the cows grazing in the grass nearby. Mary, now a widow, didn’t take it well. She isolated herself, yelling profanities at anyone that dared to come into her property. The case of Henry’s death was brushed aside, never heard of again.

We were over at Terry’s house, my momma talking to his about whatever adults talked about and sipping ice cold lemonade. Me and Terry were jumping in the puddles outside, whooping and hollering as we battled for the highest splash.

We ran inside for lemonade, sipping it in the kitchen. 

“Bryce. I have an idea.” Terry whispered. I raised an eyebrow, my interest piqued. “Let’s go to Mary’s ranch. Prank the old widow.”

I opened my mouth to say it was a bad idea, but Terry was already up and heading towards the back door. I sighed, pulling on my boots and following.

…

We peeked our head around the wall, watching Mary rock weakly in a rocking chair. Terry giggled, and we ran to the barn.

The sun was setting, the air getting colder and colder. Terry creeped into the barn, smiling. I followed, shivering. 

“I’m gonna let out her animals.” He chuckled, releasing about 10 chickens from a stall. I frowned. We were only supposed to be looking, not messing with the stuff. 

Terry rolled his eyes, dragging me to a ladder. We crawled into the loft, waiting.

…

Nearly an hour later, Mary hobbled in. She looked around, looking scared. She  shuffled quickly to a stall. 

The one Terry had emptied.

“Where’s my chickens? No. Cmon, no, it’s coming! Where are they?” She stammered.

Loud growling suddenly echoed at the doorway. She jumped, staggering fearfully behind a hayloft.  A huge… something lumbered into the barn. Mary grabbed a lantern and turned towards the beast. Only then did I see what it was.

The monster was three or four feet taller than the average man. It looked like a wolf/dog but larger, and more humanoid. It looked like a hyena also, something I’d seen in a book once.

It growled, globs of saliva dripping from its large maw. It sprinted towards the frail old lady, tackling her to the ground. I looked away, but I heard Terry gag and puke. I heard tearing and wet squelches, then it stopped. 

I listened as the beast started snuffling, then heard heavy pawsteps. I army crawled to a pile of hay. I hid inside, watching as Terry hid behind a box. 

Terry shifted his weight, the floor creaking. The monster roared, leaping into the loft and pouncing in Terry’s direction. I heard a scream, and more noises. The beast left, dragging Mary and Terry’s corpses with it. 

I got up, trembling, climbed down the ladder, and began sprinting for my life. I heard a howl, an angry growl, and pounding pawsteps behind me. I felt hot, sticky breath on my neck. I sprinted over the property line, and the steps stopped. I looked back, watching as it retreated into the forest. 

I went home, telling my mother and Terry’s that I had lost Terry in the woods. My mother took he home, comforting me as I weeped.

Once I got older, I moved away the second I could. 

If only Terry hadn’t let out those chickens.

hi all, my name is nick kazanski. i’m a 2nd generation american. decades ago my grandfather came here from ukraine, sadly he died a few days ago. as much i was grieving i was tasked with looking through his things. but i’m not here to talk about my grandfather, i’m here to share something i found with his old documents. i’ve transcribed and translated it all to english. take what you read as a warning.


PROJECT [REDACTED]

Hello this is Agent Kazanski, it’s the first day of [REDACTED], we’re in the Chernobyl Plant for this project; I have no idea why they would ever do research in such a place. They haven’t started the experiment yet. So far it’s not very clear to the agents what test they will be conducting in this two week long period, we’re mostly here to guard. It seems like today they will be filling out paperwork, at least from what I can see. I will continue to update my personal files as I find out more. That’s all for today.

Today is day two of [REDACTED]. The people in lab coats were bringing in large containers with blacked out glass and huge canisters of some mystery substances. Weird sounds are coming from the containers, a low guttural sound is the best I can describe it. Tonight I’ll be guarding alone, maybe I can check out what’s in there. 

Day three of PROJECT [REDACTED]. I shouldn’t have tried to checked what’s in those containers. I wasn’t able to see anything inside since an alarm went off when i opened the airtight lid. My boss yelled at me for a good 20 minutes about not prying but I know he’s curious about it too. They took me off the night shift for now since I can’t be trusted. Now I wonder why there are alarms, what must be inside?

Today is day seven of [REDACTED], I haven’t found anything within the past few days hence why I haven’t been updating. The other guys are getting curious too now, we’re planning to sneak in tomorrow after we find out how to disable the alarms. I have nothing for now, hopefully I’ll have a bigger update after tomorrow.

Day nine. It’s 3 am, we checked out the contents of the containers a few hours ago, Now i understand why there are airtight lids and alarms… oh god I really shouldn’t have checked. 
There are these, what should I even call them, monsters? They had long crooked arms tangled around their own necks and faces. It was like the greyish skin on those limbs were stretched and pulled to their limit, as if it grew another inch it would just all tear. The long nails of those monsters were stuck in their eyes and the mouths on their semi-human faces were hanging limp and open, almost like a feeding snake. And oh god the smell, the distinct smell of burning flesh, just like the men i’ve seen be affected by radiation poisoning. I think these creatures have been affected by the radiation here. let’s just hope they don’t get out. 

As soon as I gasped they looked straight up me, even with their long nails in their eyes. The monster grinned at me with this slack jacked smiled. It didn’t have teeth, just blackened gums and holes started ripping in it’s cheeks. I had to close the lid and throw up on the ground next to it. I shouted for the other men and immediately shut and locked the lid. I’ll update when i learn more. 

It’s day ten of [REDACTED]. I went into the head researchers office while she was on lunch break. It took quite a lot of digging but I eventually found some files relating to PROJECT [REDACTED]. 
They were talking about how these creatures came to be here in Chernobyl. Apparently they were only ever found here around the plant, so i guess my suspicions of these things being affected by this place were right. 

The people in researchers think that these creatures are the result of the homeless people here accidentally stumbling over the radioactive waste. I think they must be doing something insane here, because what kind of fucking radioactive waste does this to a human. I also don’t think there’s a way to kill these things, I’ve read through the documents several times and I haven’t found anything about disposing of them after the experiments. I’ll ask about it during my next day of work. 

It’s day twelve of PROJECT [REDACTED]. Yesterday was my wife’s birthday so I didn’t come to work. Now that I’m back I’ll share some of the rumors I heard from the other agents after asking about the disposal of the monsters. Apparently they’re planning to blow up the plant to get rid of them. I’m not sure if this is something one of the higher-ups said or if it’s just a stupid rumor, but I’m getting my family out of here tomorrow. My mother lives with us but i don’t know how we will get her out. Shes unable to walk so i don’t know how we’ll get her down 5 floors to get out. I hate the thought but we might need to leave her.

This is day thirteen, the second to last day to the end of [REDACTED]. The monsters have escaped. We’re so lucky to be leaving within the hour. It seems that one of the other agents must of let one of the lids unlocked. These monsters seem to be intelligent, because the rest of the containers were found to be unlocked by the end of the night. The guards who were at the scene were attacked and left for dead, no one dared to enter back into that space. This will probably be my last update. The train is here to take me out of this godforsaken place. 

EMERGENCY UPDATE- The project is over, but the monsters aren’t gone. I don’t know how they would think more radioactive activity would kill off those things, since they were created by the exact same thing. I saw on the news that Chernobyl has been destroyed, but my intel tells me the monsters aren’t gone. They roam the abandoned city and I’ve heard they’ve been violent to the survivors. I hope they haven’t gotten to my mother yet. 
Soon i will be leaving Ukraine with my wife and the child in her belly to get as far away as a can from the monsters as i can. 
Kazanski out. 

END OF FILE

with this i advise no one go to chernobyl without ampoule protection, if you would even go at all. 
this may have just been some story my grandfather made up to pass his time, but i’d still be cautious. 
i’ll be updating with other more detailed documents he brought with him to america. that’s all for now, bye.

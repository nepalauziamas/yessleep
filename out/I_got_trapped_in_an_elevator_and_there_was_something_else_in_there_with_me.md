I kept glancing at my watch as I knew that I was going to be late. I had spent too long procrastinating about what I was going to wear on the date and had completely lost track of time. I reached the end of the hallway and repeatedly hit the elevator button in the hopes it would miraculously speed it up.

I considered taking the stairs as I watched the numbers slowly rise as the elevator made its way towards me. I had been ecstatic getting a top floor apartment when I initially moved in but it had quickly lost its charm as it takes so long to get out of the damn building. 

The elevator finally arrived and I practically jumped inside the second the door had opened. I  pressed the button for the ground floor and waited for the doors to close. One of my elderly neighbours stepped out of her apartment and she waved at me to hold the door for her. I pretended like I didn't notice her and I could see the look of annoyance cross her face as the doors finally closed and the elevator began moving.

The same music was playing through the speakers that has probably played on repeat since the first day the building opened. I was unintentionally humming it away to myself as we made our way downwards.

The elevator began shaking and I was suddenly thrown forward against the wall as it stopped. I smashed my head against a wall and quickly lost consciousness. I awoke a short time later in pitch darkness.

I tried to push myself to my feet but my feet gave way beneath me. I pressed my hand against my head and could feel blood oozing down my cheek. I took a couple of quick breaths to try and steady myself before once again trying to stand.

It took me almost a minute to stand upright and I had to hold onto the railing as I was afraid of falling once more. I reached forward in the hopes of finding the buttons but I was disoriented and couldn't find them in the darkness.

I finally remembered that my phone should be in my pocket and began digging in my pockets in a desperate bid to retrieve it. After searching every pocket in vain I began to run my hands along the floor as it may have fallen when the elevator stopped.

I was in the middle of searching the floor when I brushed against something in the darkness. I could hear the unmistakable sound of movement as whatever it was moved away from me. 

My heart was thumping in my chest as my mind kept picturing demonic creatures preparing to mutilate and eat my remains. I waited until the sounds of movement had ceased before trying to find my phone once more.

I almost let out a scream of joy as my hands located the phone. I yanked it off the floor and brought it up to my face as I prepared to phone for help. I felt my heart sink in my chest as I spotted the battery was down to 1% and was about to die.

I knew that I didn't have time to make a phone call and spun the phone around so I could see what else was in here with me. The battery failed almost instantly but the sight that illuminated will haunt me in my dreams until the day I die.

It lit up a girl with long black hair who hung from the top of the elevator and was reaching towards me. Her hands were only inches from my face and had long razor sharp nails that appeared ready to claw my face open.

I threw myself to the ground as I was once again in utter darkness. I pushed myself against one of the walls and hoped that the girl would be as disoriented by the darkness as I was.

I felt my entire body go numb as I felt something rub against my cheek. It took me a few seconds to realise she was using her tongue to drink the blood that was on my face. She stopped after a few seconds and I knew that her face was right in front of me.

I tried not to make a sound while listening to the sounds of her breathing. The cold air from her breath was causing goosebumps to break out all across my face. 

Her hand began rubbing against my cheeks and her nails began cutting into my skin. My body had shutdown and I barely registered the pain as her nails ripped my flesh open. I only began to react as one of her nails began digging into my eye sockets. 

I began screaming as she forcibly tore my right eyeball out of its socket. She then let out a hiss as the elevator suddenly began moving once again. 

I lay there on the floor of the elevator as the doors opened in the lobby. My one good eye stared at the number of people staring in, whose faces went from celebration to horror as they looked at my mutilated face. 

No one believed me that there was something in there with me and assumed that I had a psychotic break and inflicted these injuries on myself. I gaze at myself in the mirror every morning and wonder if she will ever come and get the other eye.

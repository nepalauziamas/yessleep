Just to give some information, I was part of a search team. I’m not a part of it anymore after what happened. Some time ago, we were alerted of a hiker that went missing in the woods. So a search party of about 40-50 people was arranged. The woods are fairly big so having that many people helps to scour the area. About 5 people were put to a singular group.

The area of the woods mine and another group was sent to search was an area of trees that stayed dead. The forest is just completely dead in that area, no animals and no plant life. I never liked this part of woods, ever since I was child I felt like I was being watched in that part. I, along with the others, started the search. My group went in one direction and the other in the opposite direction.

Throughout the whole time there, I felt chills down my spine as if something was watching me. I tried to dismiss the whole thing and focus on searching for the missing hike. The farther we went in the more I felt my stomach sink lower and lower as my heart rate sped up. By the time it was nearly dusk, I had nearly worked myself into a panic attack, but I tried to stay calm.

It was getting dark now so our group leader led us back to our meet up spot where the other group was already at. Both leaders decided to call it a day and continue searching tomorrow. Everyone agreed, looking very much worried. Perhaps they had felt what I felt. After about 45 minutes, we all felt despair. We spent 45 minutes trying to get out when it took a shorter time to get back to the tree edge. It wasn’t like we didn’t mark the trees; we marked the trees we passed, but now we can’t find the marked trees. 

It was like the trees were moving and distorting our sense of direction. We had tried using our phones to call for help but there was no signal. So we continued on walking. I tripped on a tree root that shouldn’t have been there. I fell over and when I went to get up I noticed a voice recording cassette tape. I picked it up and alerted the people in my party. 

We decided to listen to it since we saw nothing else to do. We had succumbed to the fact that we were trapped in the forest. We decided to listen to it. 

\[Beep\]

“\[Heavy breathing\] Listen, I don’t have much time left before I’m fully consumed, but to whoever finds this, Get the hell out of the woods as fast as you can! \[Coughing\] I had only come here to hike but things went downhill fast. After about 2 hours into my hike I noticed something off. The scenery had changed from the green, luscious forest I had entered; to the dark, dead forest I had found myself in. I tried finding my way back but no matter what I tried I couldn’t. Night had fallen and now I was for sure stuck. \[Coughing\] 

I tried to sleep but I couldn’t and then it attacked. Vines had stabbed into most of my body and was wrapping around me. The pain was unbearable as I felt my arms and legs break. It’s the trees, the trees are alive! \[Coughing\] I’m now being absorbed by the tree roots. One last thing, to whoever found this, if you make it out of here, can you tell my family I love them. \[Coughing\]”

\[Beep\]

That was the end of the recording. We looked around at each other and to the trees that surrounded us.

One of the people spoke up, “S-surely that wasn’t real, r-right?”

“Why else would someone record that? The shits and giggles of it?” another person retorted.

“Hey, don’t try to start anything, we all need to find a way out of here, regardless of it it is real or not,” I stated

Everyone nodded their heads in agreement.

“B-but how are we going to get out if the trees can move?” Another person asked

Everyone just looked at the ground and stayed silent. We didn’t know how we would get out. 

“G-guys, I feel something on my le-” someone said right as they were dragged away.

We heard their screams as the sound of bone crushing followed. Their screams stopped abruptly as we were all shaken to our core. We were too shocked to even scream. We just stood there staring in the direction of which our teammate was dragged off to.

It wasn’t long before another person was dragged away with their screams being cut off abruptly. This knocked us out of our shock and just started running. As I ran, I could hear the sounds of others screaming, knowing that they were taken. I just ran as fast as I could. There were now about 4 of us left just running. 

The person off to my right screamed. I looked up just in time to see them get impaled by the tree branch. Their blood fell on me, covering me completely. The other two grabbed me by the arms and dragged me along as they ran. I ran with them but I was still shocked. My body moved on its as my head went blank. 

The sun was just peaking up above the trees as we saw the woods edge. I heard one of them say something as our running sped up. I guess the thought of surviving snapped me out of my shock enough to notice all the police cars and the two helicopters that flew above us.

Many things happened after that, that are just a blur to my memory. It’s been almost 2 years since that incident and I’ve finally felt confident sharing my story. I go see a therapist for the lasting damage the incident left on my mental state. But I am doing well. The other 2 people that survived are doing well also. Strangely enough, the incident pulled us together and we are now close friends.

I guess we felt that we could only ever truly understand each other, after sharing something as traumatic as that. I don’t know if I will ever truly move on from this but knowing I have 2 other people who feel the same way makes dealing with this a lot easier. And to everyone that reads this, please stay safe no matter what it is that you are doing.

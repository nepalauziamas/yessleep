 !!TW: descriptive violence!!

Ever heard the tale of Santa? I'm sure you have. Everyone has. But what if I tell you that's not right? The story they tell you isn't the right story. 

They just made a more "kid-friendly" version so they won't scare the kids. Now, you may not believe me. 

I understand, but just read this story, for the time being, k? K.

On the night of Christmas, two kids lie in bed. Susie, the older sister, heard a noise and woke up. She knew it was Santa, so she woke up her little brother Andrew. 

"Andrew! C'mon, It's Santa! He's here!" She said. Her brother got out of bed and they both snuck out of their rooms. 

They snuck down the stairs and saw the silhouette of a very large man. They both looked at each other and whispered.

 "Santa!" They quickly but carefully traveled down the stairs and into the living room. They saw the silhouette of... Wait. That's not Santa.

 It's huge. It has hundreds of sharp teeth and a billion eyes, and it looked slimy and monstrous. 

The siblings were scared and shivering from fear. They dove behind the two recliner chairs in the living room.

They both watched in terror as the creature extended its long tongue and wrapped it around the cup of milk, glugged it, and threw it, shattering it completely in a loud crash.

Instead of extending its tongue, it walked and grabbed the plate of chocolate cookies and dumped them in its mouth, shattering the plate as well. 

Its slimy tongue licked its large mouth and teeth. The children trembled in fear as terrifying thoughts danced in their heads.

Andrew began crying and the creature heard it. It turned to the recliners and walked toward them, snarling its large teeth. 

"Naughty Children, up past bedtime. You should be punished." The creature extended its tongue from its mouth and it lunged at Susie but she dodged it. 

The children began screaming and crying. They ran up the stairs as the creature crashed into everything chasing after them.

The kids screamed and they cried and they internally prayed to the gods above that they wouldn't die on this fateful night.

Susie ran as fast as her legs would take her, but Andrew didn't run fast enough. The creature grabbed his leg with its mouth completely tearing his foot. 

The monster got ahold of Andrew's head and squeezed it until it popped like a weasel. Screams and cries echoed, Susie only ran faster. 

She finally got to her room and dashed it, slamming the door. She climbed into bed hiding under the covers and pretended she was asleep.

Her fear only grew as she heard the bedroom door open and the snarling of the creature. She whimpered and cried out of fear.

The creature pulled the covers off of her and tried to grab her head but failed instead and scratched her face. Susie grabbed a pencil from the side of the bed and stabbed it in one of its eyes and pulled it out, taking the eyeball with it.

The creature recoiled in pain and screeched. Susie hid under her covers again shivering and crying. 

Morning came and the police had already raided the house when Susie awoke. She told the cops everything and they took her to safety.

They never did find the creature's body though. 

It's a shame knowing they didn't believe her and only blamed her for the death of her brother and parents.

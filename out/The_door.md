Hammond woke up today with a feverish desire to impact the world in the best way possible, to reach out and make a positive change in someone's life even if they are just a stranger. "Now, it's time to make breakfast! I'll start the day right so i can be productive. Two eggs, a handful of blueberries and strawberries, some toast and a cup of warm coffee sounds nice." Hammond began prepping his meal in a kitchen which seemed energized, and a place of comfort that would springboard anyone into action in their daily lives. It's a small kitchen with a nice view of the living room's double windows,  permitting a view of the horizon. Right next to the entrance was the door to the apartment, off white and almost a beige color, courtesy of the previous tenants who had an affinity for smoking in large quantities. Hammond glanced at his front door as he walked past with a plate full of morning goodies and his steaming mug. Turning his back to it quickly and facing the living room he thought, "and the day begins". 

The clock reads 8:59am and Hammond lays his empty plate and mug at the kitchen counter top and slips on his shoes. "There is definitely a certain kind of allure coming from outside today! Must be fate calling me to a fantastic day!" Stepping outside feels great for Hammond. The long hallway echoes with his footsteps so loudly that it almost sounds like another pair of feet. He turns slightly and notices there is indeed someone else in the hall but they aren't moving. They're just standing at their door. Hammond rationalizes to himself,  "Heh they must be waiting on someone to let them in." Finally, he's on the elevator and headed down to the ground floor! The metallic groans are telling of a long history of usage but it's never errored for Hammond while living here. "Surely it won't error today." A small light flicks on just under the 'close door' button that Hammond never noticed before. It reads, maintenence. "Surely not today,  please not today." 'Ding!' Hammond rushes out the door,  a bead of sweat forming on his brow.

"Someone help please! We need and ambulance!" Shattered glass is littering the building lobby, a car is parked in the window, and a woman is holding someone in her arms, covered in blood. She screams for help but no one seems to react! "What is everyone's problem?" Hammond begins to speak, "Ma'am what happened? Is he breathing? Does he..." He trails off. As he gets closer he understands why no one responded. The man she holds has passed. It should be clear by the amount of man there is left lying there but hope and desperation does wonders to the mind, especially in times of panic. Emergency responders rush in tending to the woman and escorting everyone out of the building. Hammond is hurrying to get away from the horrific car accident out into the street. He's completely outside and he completely loses his lunch. "So much for my 'healthy start'." He wipes his mouth and continues shakily down the sidewalk. "OK, not the best preparation but on to an open interview I guess." 

The bank is a small, local business but a potentially lucrative job for Hammond. He sits in an office across from a man clad in business attire. "There's no doubt in my mind you are qualified for this position Hammond", he says "but I'm concerned about your personal life. You have no support it seems. No emergency contacts, no prior colleagues to contact, and I'm sorry to say that there has been a troubling smell since you've walked in. I'm sorry but we just don't have a place for you here." Hammonds face is beat red and he responds, "O-ok. Thank you f-for your time." Like the traumatic experience earlier, this is one of Hammonds greatest fears. "I am worthy! I am! I am..." Hammond heads outside in an embarrassed, weakened stroll. The smell of old food and musty city fills his lungs. Across the street he sees an entrance to a diner with a beige-ish colored door. He stares at it wondering, "why today? Why me, of all people?" 

I snap out of my  trance and say aloud, "Tomorrow Hammond. Tomorrow I'll get started on my fantastic day." I walk away from the hallway leading to my front door and leave my plate and mug on the counter where I've left many others from previous mornings. The kitchen smells of old food and rot. My shoes set in the same spot they always are. Plopping down on the couch I think, "Ya I'll do it tomorrow."

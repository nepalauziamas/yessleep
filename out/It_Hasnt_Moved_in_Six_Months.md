When I was a boy I lived with my granny, I was always her favorite and I could do very little wrong in her eyes. She had a nice farm with the basic animals that you would expect such as cows and pigs, there were chickens, other birds such as peacocks. I loved my granny more than anything, but unfortunately time always marches on and soon she passed. The house was left to her son, my uncle. 

  As I have said time marches on and soon my uncle, still being fairly young for and old man suffered from a heart attack and died. Oddly enough he did not want to leave the house to anyone, but with all the memories that I have over there, I felt the need to keep the house. I fought tooth and nail and borrowed more money than I feel comfortable having on me, but I was successful. Seven months ago from now, moved into my childhood home and could not be happier. 

  My first month there was just memory lane, soon enough the excitement wore down and I started to notice any renovations needed for the house. My uncle was not very good at maintaining homes, so I had my work cut out for me. As I began working I discovered a hidden room that was boarded up and covered with drywall. I decided that I should see what's with the room, so I tore down the boards and opened the door. It looked like a nursery, cradle and all. 

  I explored this new room and saw what looked like blood stains, but I really could not be sure. That's when I heard it, a weird tapping sound. I looked around and walked out the door feeling my heart beating faster. I feel like maybe I was imagining things, so I went to make coffee using the same coffee maker that my granny had from twenty rooms. I drank my coffee and turned on the television, sunk back and relaxed as I drifted off to sleep. 

  I woke up to the sound of a newborn crying, it echoed as if it was in my ears. I looked around for the source, but was not able to find it. I went to the hospital thinking there was some other issue. After waiting for hours, hearing people coughing up phlegm and other disgusting noises, I was finally seen just to be told that they were not able to see any problems with me through hours of testing, even being taken in for a psychological evaluation. I went home and rested again. 

  I woke up to that same sound and the same sound as when I entered that room, and I heard it get closer and then I saw a strange claw slice through my ankle. I stumbled off the couch crawling away and that is when I saw it. I don't even know what it is, all I know is that it looked like a small wet mummy coated in some kind of blood. The fingers were long and claw like, it resembled something from some cosmos horror movie from the eighties. It crawled towards me screaming louder. I made my way towards the room and stayed in the room and it just stopped at the threshold. 

  I looked at it with curiosity seeing the almost human face all coated in some red moisture on its boney structure barely covered with sinew. I realized it won't cross, so I grabbed it and pulled it towards me, it fought vigorously until I slid it with me. I saw it's eyes roll back and the movements stopped, the creature froze and felt as if it was drying out. I dragged it into the center of the room and went to a store nearby to set up a camera to watch it. I changed the lock on the door and locked it up never entered it again. 

  I have been checking the creature everyday and for the last six months, the creature has not moved at all. I am still cautious, but determined. I will not lose my home and I will not let this thing torment me as it might have tormented my family. I am currently scouring the web trying to find information on this thing and I will destroy it!

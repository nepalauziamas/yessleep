every couple years or so me and my husband go out to a cabin with my best friend Jenna and her fiancé Rick.  it’s supposed to be a fun little thing we do at the beginning of winter where we go to this campsite, we skate on the frozen lake, build snow men and fight with snow balls. all while very drunk on whiskey, but you get the idea. anyhow we were on one of these trips and one night i was feeling i’ll and decided it would be better if i headed to bed instead of staying up late. after a bit of protest from Jenna, Rick and Simon (my husband) i went to bed at about 8:00. around 3 hours later Simon storms into the room smelling like alcohol babbling about something that starts a huge fight between us.  i can’t even remember what it was about but i stormed downstairs and started crying on the sofa. Jenna walked down stairs half sober and i vented to her how i was sick and couldn’t do this right now. she listened patiently and suggested that it may be better if we left a bit early to cool off so we decided to go home  earlier then scheduled then we packed our things and left. 

we were driving on the empty highways where we couldn’t hear anything but cold wind rustling the trees. i remember contemplating if i was to old for this cabin tradition because throughout the whole trip i couldn’t stop thinking of my daughter Louise. getting drunk and playing in the snow seemed like to much effort and it might be better if we changed locations and stayed at a hotel instead. then suddenly the tires screech and we go headfirst into a pine tree. my first thought is to look at my husband who’s bleeding everywhere and start crying hysterically begging him to wake up. i check his pulse and he’s dead. i start thinking how my daughters going to not have a father her whole life and how i just killed her dad when a sudden wave of euphoria washes over me and i realise that i’m going to die too. i’ll miss my mom and Louise and i’ll never forgive myself for making her an orphan. i see how Jenna is going to cry when she hears the news and that was my last thought before i closed my eyes.

keep in mind this highway was extremely country ish. there was no police station for miles and even if they heard about our crash the second it happened it would’ve taken at least four hours to drive out and save us at which point we would’ve both been very dead. if not from the crash, from hypothermia. 

that’s why i was very confused when i woke up in the hospital the next morning, doctors were everywhere. i was frantically trying to piece together how on earth i was alive while backing away from the men and women in white coasts and surgical masks. but nothing confused me more when my husband walked in. i work in medicine, from all the injuries this man had last night not to mention the lack of a heart beat it would’ve taken at least 3 years for him to even partially recover, yet he walks into the hospital room without a scratch.  he comes closer  and although he looks almost identical to my husband,  i can tell something has changed i scan his face up and down and start listing things in my head
no dimples
darker eyes
straighter, whiter teeth
darker eye bags 
slightly paler skin
then he’s speaks, he sounds completely different. whoever this guys is, he is not Simon. the next few hours were kind of a blur. but when we’re walking to our car which was conveniently parked in the car park (also completely untouched) “Simon” was telling me how i was in a coma for weeks after falling down the stairs and how i might’ve had some “hallucinations”. but i wasn’t hallucinating. i am a very lucid sleeper. i know when i’m asleep. if i was in a coma i would’ve recognised it. the timeline he told me also didn’t match up. after i told him about my dream and how he was supposed to be dead, he laughed in my face and tried to gaslight me into thinking we went on the trip last year meaning we couldn’t have done it this year. which wasn’t true. i remember sitting at my desk last year wishing i was at that cabin. we also planned for months about packing lists and etc. he kept telling me i  was "delusional" and "crazy"but nothing he was saying made sense?

The biggest red flag was when we went home to my 4 year old daughter and after i hugged her for a very long time, she looked up at Simon  and i could tell she saw it too. After he left she whispered in my ear "is that really daddy?" i looked around to see if Simon was near by  and whispered back "Darling, I'm not sure." 

its been 12 years since this incident and I'm starting to believe it was a dream. i’m ninety percent sure he is my husband. although little things have changed. my daughter is 16 now and has forgotten all about it but her question will stick with me forever. i feel kind of upset knowing shell never know the Simon i knew.

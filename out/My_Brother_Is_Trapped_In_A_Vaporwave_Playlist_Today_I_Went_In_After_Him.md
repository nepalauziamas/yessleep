[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/uour37/im_back_from_the_cursed_playlistand_maybe_truth/)

It wasn’t hard to find time alone with my comatose older brother Seth. My parents seemed both surprised and relieved that I’d stepped up. The only challenge was making sure that the night shift nurses didn’t catch on to my mad-scientist setup: a set of headphones for each of us, plugged into the laptop where the cursed playlist was stored.

At first, I tried playing the music for Seth only, with alarms set for different times. The only sounds in the dark hospital room were beeping machines, my brother’s shallow breathing–and the faint, eerie rhythms of the playlist. At any moment Seth might sit up in bed–pale, shrieking, incoherent–and I couldn’t tell if I was excited or terrified by the prospect.

I felt the same way about diving back into the playlist myself.

Strangely enough, I couldn’t fall asleep during the track I’d played before, no matter how hard I tried. It was like the instinctive, animal part of my brain knew what falling asleep to this music might mean, and fought it as hard as possible. I’d kept myself awake for almost a full day to make dozing easier, but it was still a few tracks later when I finally nodded off…

*You’ve been here before.*

*But where is ‘here,’ exactly? A lobby–or rather, a blend of them. There’s the potted plants, carpet squares, and tabletop children’s toys of a dentist’s office–but also the luggage trolley and reception desk of a hotel. There’s a bunch of those business-award plaques, but they’re all blank, nameless. And of course, there’s the background music.*

*Of course, no one is here.*

*No one that* you *can see.*

*Instead of darkness outside, there’s light–the blinding sun of a summer afternoon. You can only make out vague shadows beyond the glass doors and windows, which are locked–of course.*

*Walking past the empty reception desk, you feel like you’re breaking some sort of rule.*

*In front of you, two brass elevators. To your right, an office door labeled ‘MANAGER.’ To your left, a hotel hallway lined with rooms. The lights are off, except for glowing red ‘EXIT’ signs. The rattle of an ice machine somewhere puts you on edge, and the smell of chlorine burns your nostrils. Something’s dripping down there, and a yellow CAUTION: WET FLOOR warning blocks your path.*

*That’s right–now you remember this place. A family trip. Mid-90’s. You and Seth were allowed to go to the pool alone for the first time, but you got lost and couldn’t find your hotel room…*

*Did you* ever *find your way back? Or have you always been here, wandering these endless frigid halls?*

*The pool room is dark but the water is lit from below, and you feel drawn toward its aquamarine depths…*

*You hear a splash. You realize suddenly that no, you don’t really want to know what’s at the bottom of that pool. You back away quickly, but not quickly enough. You slip on the*

*\[WET FLOOR\]*

*and feel yourself sliding impossibly toward the aquamarine water. You claw at the slick title, scramble with your feet–no use. It’s like the horizontal floor has become a vertical slope. Your fingers wrap around the door jam and you hold tight as though you were dangling above an abyss…and when you turn around, you see a lightless tunnel at the far end of the pool. It reminds you of a carnival ride, and sure enough you see a few abandoned-looking rafts bobbing inside of it.*

*Another splash. Is something moving in there, or is it just the tunnel, licking its hungry lips?*

*Waiting for you to let go, to keep sliding until you disappear into that inviting aquamarine water.*

*You use the door frame to pull yourself back up. Gravity returns to normal. Somewhere, an ice machine rattles–and the music plays on.*

*You go back to the elevators, trying not to look behind you.*

*PING.*

*A brass door slides open…like it was waiting for you.*

*The sound of conversation echoes from the poolside hallway. The end of a party: raucous laughter of drunken adults, running children’s feet–but how could so many people have fit into one tiny hotel room? What were they doing in there? Another peal of laughter. You don’t want to know.*

*Whatever’s coming, you’d prefer not to share a ride with it. You slip into the elevator and jam the ‘DOOR CLOSE’ button until you're shut inside a brass cocoon that slowly rises–although you can’t remember choosing a floor.*

*Wall lamps, carpet, closed doors. You can’t see an end to the hallway in front of you.*

*The random numbers and letters on the doors change when you’re not looking. 86D becomes B1911. C3 becomes…wait. 347A. That was your room back then. If you close your eyes tight and really, REALLY focus…*

*You’re standing in front of it now.*

*As you reach out for the handle, the door creaks open.*

*PING.*

*Behind you, the elevator.*

*You have mere seconds to avoid whatever’s inside–*

*You make a choice.*

*The room seems empty at first, and you’re grateful for the solidity of the door behind you.*

*Thick curtains, wall unit blowing cold air, paisley bedspreads and anonymous furniture. The television is on, people on waterskis with too-bright smiles advertising a suntan lotion you half-remember. You don’t see the figure pressed against the wall until it’s too late.*

*“You made it,” Seth gasps. “You came back…”*

*Apart from the fact that he’s standing, your older brother looks the same. His eyes, though, tell a different story. A story of weeks, maybe months, spent wandering these endless halls and avoiding their inhabitants.*

*Now that you’re together, the danger seems doubled. Your eyes dart nervously around the ceiling.*

*“I set an alarm,” you say. “If we’re together when it goes off…”*

*“An alarm gets you out of here,” Seth sighs, “when* ‘here’ *is ready to let you go. Not before. Haven’t you noticed that time works differently in this place?”*

*“You mean…” you stammer. There’s a knock at the door. It starts faint, but gets louder and louder until you can see dust rattling from the hinges. You have a feeling that it's not going to stop until it breaks down the door…*

*“Come on,” Seth whispers. “This way.” Your older brother leads you into the bathroom. It has a toilet, a shower–and a tile corridor extending impossibly far into the distance. You recognize it right away: the hallway to your high school shower room. “Our memories change things here. It’s our only way to fight back.” Just like with the door, you realize.*

*Floor-to-ceiling grimy yellow tile.  Dim lights. The smell of soap and spray-on deodorant. Somewhere, a shower is running, and in places the slippery floor almost seems misty. Occasionally you glimpse lockers or bathroom stalls, but each time Seth whisks you away, deeper into the maze.*

*“When you start to see signs of life, that’s this place trying to trap you,” Seth gasps. “I think that’s its goal: it wants to trap consciousness here, to feed off of it…forever…” You’re not sure why he’s so tired, until– “I can’t drag much more out of this memory. I need you to take over…remember a way out of here…”*

That’s what I was trying to do when rough hands shook me awake.

“Hey!” the nurse snapped. “What’s all this?” I realized with horror that she’d taken the headphones off of Seth. “I don’t know what all this is…,” she went on, “or why you’re all…*wet*…but in the future you need to clear things like this with us first. For all you know, this stuff you’ve set up could be interfering with your brother’s equipment!”

I was too shocked and disappointed to speak. I’d been so close to freeing Seth!

All I could do was take the notes above and plan out my next move…

Because it seems like every time I go back for my brother, the playlist gets more dangerous.

At the time i was around 14 years old, my parents split up when i was only a year old and my dad has been struggling with child support ever since then. So every fortnight my mum would let me go to my dads house for the weekend. 

Nothing really weird happened until my dad moved to a little plot of land not so far away from my mums house that was about 10 acres. And because my dad worked as a lumberjack most his life, alot of equipment and tree logs were just hanging around on the property. 

We were mostly surrounded by alot of descent people, they were really quiet so we just let them be. And it was a big bonus because there was a shop not that far from where we were so we could just walk there to get some food. 

After a couple of weeks of my dad being at this new place, it was around 7:30 and it was almost pitch black outside. So as i was sitting down near the front of the house whilst my dad was taking a shower, i was just having a hot chocolate and enjoying the silence and fresh air of nature. Thats until it got too silent, no insects, no wind, just pure silence. I was obviously caught off gaurd by this so i looked around to still see the empty darkness of the treeline that follows the fence around the property, i looked down to my dog that was laying right beside me. Now that i look back he actually seemed a bit startled with his ears and tail standing straight up and the white teeth being shown through a growl he was doing.

I looked back up to the treeline and seen something that i couldnt quite understand, they were... keys? You know that glare from metal when you point it towards a light, thats what it looked like, i could hear the dangling of keys being tossed together. But it wasnt a branch that was holding them up, it was fingers...

I observed the white, still and dead skin being held up by a decaying arm, i froze. My body tensed up as i stared at this unhumanly long and distorted body hunched over looking straight at me. As soon as i knew it my dog started to bark the loudest i have ever heard a dog bark, but i still didnt move. After an intense death stare with this... thing, i quickly picked up my dog and threw both of us into the house. I was sweating like hell and i peered out the window to look at it again, it wasnt there anymore.

After that, Another month went by and i didnt tell anyone about what happened, i ended up going out to the treeline the next morning and eventually found the keys hanging on a loose branch. I honestly kept thinking to myself if this was just a brain f#ck or if this actually happened. Im 24 years old now and my dad still lives on the property to this day. But my dad has been acting strange lately, like he bought a shotgun and he hangs it up just above the door. He says its for "hunting purposes" but i think he seen it aswell. I just hope he is safe...

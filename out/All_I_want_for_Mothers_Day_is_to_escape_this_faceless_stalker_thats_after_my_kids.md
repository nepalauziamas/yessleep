  

This wasn’t supposed to happen. I’m just a stay at home mom. A housewife. Gah, I don’t even live in a dark looming mansion in the middle of the woods where some tragedy occurred. I live in the suburbs in a freaking culdesac. There’s an elementary school two blocks away! How did I end up in the plot of a horror movie here, of all places?!

Sorry, I’m a bit frazzled. To say I’m running on very little sleep is the understatement of the century. I’ve actually done my damnedest not to even blink longer than necessary since this has happened. I need to be alert, and protect my family from… her? It? I don’t know, but I can’t let whatever it is near my children.

Let me back up a bit. As I said before, I’m a typical stay at home mom living a very typical life. I have two children. Four year old Elijah, and nine month old Olivia. My husband Jake has a decent paying job that allowed me to leave my teaching position when Eli was born, and I’ve been all about my family ever since.

I honestly love being a wife and mother. I have always wanted to stay home with my children while they are little and I’m so happy I get to do it. But I think many, many parents can relate when I say it’s easy to sort of… lose yourself. 

I spend my days doing for my kids. Taking Eli to preschool, changing Livi’s diapers, mealtimes, teeball practice, tumbling class, play dates, snacks, art projects, endless games of pretend, etc. There’s always something going on. And after the kids go to sleep, I consider it of the utmost importance to keep my marriage alive. Talk to Jake about his day, spend quality time together, make sure we keep the intimacy going even through the rough times. Any time to myself is spent either cleaning the house or crashing in front of the television. I never get to really do much for myself anymore, and the woman I was before getting married and having kids was starting to feel like a stranger.

Until I began my nightly walks.

It started when Livi was about six months old. She had finally begun to sleep through the night, and I was so excited to finally get some decent sleep again. However, I had also been dealing with some unrelated family drama which had resulted in a pretty bad fight with my sister. My whole life, I’ve struggled with insomnia that gets really bad when I’m stressed, and the family conflicts had me tossing and turning hours after I had gone to bed.

Frustrated, I finally threw the covers off myself and crept quietly out of the bedroom. The argument with my sister was replaying over and over in my mind, and I paced the house thinking of all the ways I could’ve avoided the conflict, or the comebacks I wish I’d thought of at the time. The squeak of a floorboard brought me back to reality and reminded me that I couldn’t pace as angrily as I’d like without waking my family. So before I knew it I’d slipped on my sneakers and jacket, and made my way outside.

I wasn’t really thinking. Just needing to “walk it off” and took off marching down my driveway, into the culdesac, and up the street. I kicked at the pebbles and grumbled, allowing my frustration to take over. But the longer I walked, the more my stress was fading. It was a beautiful night. Warm, with a pleasant breeze. I took some deep breaths as I walked, and found myself feeling much more positive about the situation. When it suddenly hit me exactly what I’d done.

Now, my neighborhood is safe. Like I said, I live close to a school and had automatically headed in that direction on autopilot, since that’s the path I usually walk with the kids on nice days. As I stood there on the sidewalk by the school, I knew that I wasn’t in any danger. I wasn’t going to be kidnapped or murdered. And there were plenty of streetlights, so I wasn’t in some dark, intimidating alleyway. So there was no real reason to fear. But still, I was a woman out walking the streets at 2:00 am. There’s an intrinsic fear in that situation. It felt unfamiliar, and I realized I probably hadn’t been out at that hour in a very long time. Heck, have I ever just been hanging out outside by myself in the middle of the night? Certainly not since college, and certainly not sober.

That’s when I realized something else. I hadn’t told my husband I was leaving. He would be worried if he woke up to find me gone, and likely upset that I’d just taken off into the night like that. He’s the old fashioned type and would definitely consider it unsafe for me to be out at this hour, no matter how safe the neighborhood was. 

And the kids! What if they woke up? Jake is such a hard sleeper, he barely registers when Livi’s coos and fussing comes over the monitor. He probably wouldn’t budge until she builds up to wailing, which would wake Eli, and then we’re all in for a bad night!

For a second I felt a rising panic, and… something else. Something that reminded me of the woman I used to be before I was Eli and Livi’s mother. Before I was Jake’s wife. Back when I was just… me. 

What I was feeling, was rebellion. And it was oddly thrilling. I wasn’t supposed to be out here. I was breaking some sort of rule with this little excursion. I was suppose to be at home, sleeping next to my husband. Ready to jump up to soothe a crying baby at a moment’s notice. Being out here in the middle of the night wasn’t where I belonged. And yet. This was exactly where I wanted to be.

Maybe it seems silly to you. After all, what’s the big deal if some bored housewife can’t sleep and goes for a walk one night? Sure, there was a risk that the kids could wake up and I’d return home to mayhem. There was the risk my husband would be annoyed I’d gone out without telling him. But in the end, I really wasn’t hurting anyone, but I was still getting to rebel in some small way. Maybe if I was a better writer I could convey the freedom it seemed to give me, the itch it was scratching that I never knew I’d had. But all I can say is that it was the first time I’d felt like myself in a long time.

I walked around the school. I looked at the trees and enjoyed the way their shadows twisted in the moonlight. I watched a couple of raccoons diving into a dumpster. I listened to the crickets chirping around me. I’d find myself instinctively walking with a little bounce like I often do when soothing a fussy Livi. At one point I was lost in thought and halted right in the middle of the road, whipping my head around wildly searching for Eli, before remembering again that I was, for once, on my own and not responsible for any small children at the moment. And each time I had this realization, I’d smile and savor it.

I had a truly nice time. I felt so at peace by the time I strolled casually back up my driveway, some twenty minutes or so after I’d stormed out. It hadn’t been a long outing, but I felt oddly replenished. I locked the door behind me and crept to Eli’s room, then Livi’s. A quick peek showed both their small, sleeping forms in their beds. I tiptoed to my bedroom, where Jake’s steady snores assured me that he had also slept through my short walk. I smirked to myself as I slipped between the sheets, feeling like an ornery child who had gotten away with something naughty. I don’t remember falling asleep. Next thing I knew, Livi’s cries crackled over the monitor and I awoke to morning light filling the room.

I had a great day after that first night. You know how they say you can’t pour from an empty cup? I felt as though my late night outing had filled the cup that I hadn’t realized was running low. I had more patience with Eli that day as he got up to his usual antics. His constant questions and requests did not wear on me as they so often did, and I found I had more energy to chase him all over the yard with his sister squealing happily in my arms. I took the kids to the park and actually played alongside them, instead of sitting on a bench nearby to scroll social media.

So that’s how it began. Once or twice a week, I began to take a little walk in the moonlight. My body had grown accustomed to waking up with Livi, so I would often randomly wake up around 1:00 or 2:00 am, listening for her cries only to hear the sound of her rain machine over the monitor. When I couldn’t go back to sleep, I’d grab my jacket and slip out the front door.

I never mentioned it to anyone. The secrecy was oddly thrilling for me. I enjoyed having something that was just mine. And when I was outside, walking past the rows of dark, quiet houses, I was just a woman. Not a wife or mother. Just a person, enjoying the small pleasure of a late night stroll.

It was great until a few nights ago. Now I will remain firmly in my home as soon as the sun sets.

The school is surrounded by a walking track. During the day it is heavily populated with students running laps for gym or neighbors walking their dogs. But in the middle of the night, it’s all mine.

I was daydreaming as I walked, peering at the school and imagining Elijah and Olivia attending there one day. When a sound I’d never heard on my walks before interrupted my thoughts.

A woman’s voice. Humming.

The voice was coming from in front of me. Some ways ahead, sitting on the bench, I could see the silhouette of a woman. 

Moving closer, I got a better look. Long, flowing white hair spilled down her shoulders and into her lap. It obscured her face as she sat with her head slightly bowed, as though praying. Her hands came into view as I moved even closer. Long, thin fingers over which pale skin stretched tight. Her long, thin dress fell right above her bare feet. And she swayed slightly as she hummed an unfamiliar tune in a low voice.

My very first instinct was slight annoyance, which I quickly squashed. Just because it was 1:30 am and I certainly \*expected\* to have the track to myself at such an unusual hour, doesn’t mean I own it. She had just as much right to be here as I did, I begrudgingly reminded myself.

My second emotion was suspicion, which I also attempted to squash. Sure, it was pretty weird for this random woman to be out this late. But couldn’t the same be said for me? 

She hadn’t seemed to notice me approaching and I was glad for that as I spun on my heel and started back the way I’d come. 

Now, I know this is where many people may say alarms had gone off in their head, and that was why they were veering away from the mysterious woman. I’m ashamed to say that at this point in time I wasn’t driven by fear, but social anxiety. I hadn’t expected to see another person and I didn’t want to risk any sort of chit chat. I’m awkward enough during the day, thank you very much. I didn’t need to find out how much worse I would be in the middle of the night.

And had I continued on my way home… I often wonder if things would’ve been different. If I’d just kept my head forward and gone straight home, curled up next to my husband, and let sleep take me… would I be writing this now? Or would my biggest worry be getting Livi through the horrible teething process, or teaching Eli to not play so rough? I miss when those were the types of stressors I faced. And I often wonder during weak moments these last couple of nights— as I try to stay awake to stand guard over my children— if I hadn’t turned back, maybe… just maybe life would be bearable. 

But the fact is that I didn’t go straight home without an issue. And my life has been spiraling ever since.

The humming stopped… and I looked back. And the woman’s head was no longer bowed. She was looking straight at me. And something was… wrong.

I couldn’t quite tell what was off in the dark, but suddenly she was standing up. The movement was so sudden I hadn’t actually seen her moving to make the transition from sitting to standing. One moment I was looking at her, and she sitting on the bench. Then, just like that, she was standing a few feet in front of it, her tall, gangly body facing towards me, with long, skinny arms dangling much further past her hips than one would expect to see.

As I stood frozen in place, she moved again, and again very suddenly. Suddenly, she was a few feet closer to me, bathed in the glow of a streetlight. And I saw. I saw what was wrong.

She had no face. It was as if someone had plastered smooth white skin perfectly over where he face should be.

And she raised her long, spindly arm, and pointed to me. I couldn’t move. I just stared, as a low deep rumbling emitted from her… mouth??? Gah I don’t know, but suddenly she was making this low sound that seemed to be sending vibrations through my body, and she was beginning to sway slowly on the spot.

One more blink, and she was about five feet closer to me, and that’s when I finally found the momentum to run.

I booked it down the track towards my home. I didn’t dare look back until I rounded the corner leading to my culdesac.

The woman was not chasing me, and I breathed a sigh of relief. Until I got closer to my home, and saw movement in the shadows.

Two silhouettes emerged from the bushes below Eli’s bedroom window. One was very small, and holding the hand of a very tall woman with flowing hair, who was cradling a much smaller form. The realization hit me all at once.

It was her. And she had my children.

Immediately, my fear evaporated and was replaced by an intense primal need to protect my little ones. This thing thought it could just take my children?! My babies?!?

Yeah, that wasn’t going to happen.

I took off after that faceless hussy with a roar I never thought I was capable of creating. At that moment, I really didn’t care that she was clearly supernatural and who knows what she was capable of. My focus was on my kids and doing anything possible to save them. Those two are my world and if she wanted them, she was going to have to kill me first.

Looking back, I think my instinctual reaction of motherly protection was what actually saved them. I don’t think she expected it, because she dropped Livi (who thankfully landed on the bushes and only received two minor scratches on her back) dropped Eli’s hand, and was gone.

I hurried to my kids, not knowing nor caring where the entity had gone, and held them close. Livi didn’t seem to register being dropped but was miffed about being woken, grunting and whining in protest. Eli was slowly coming to, as if waking from a very deep sleep.

“What’s wrong mommy?” He asked innocently, as I hurried them inside and locked the door.

They both fell back to sleep almost instantly. I kept them in my bed, and watched them all night. The next day, Eli remembered nothing of the night before, and Jake hadn’t heard a peep.

Oh, I told Jake all about it. Don’t think for one second I would witness a faceless lady trying to kidnap my kids and NOT tell him. But I was infuriated by his response. He gave me a sympathetic look and asked if Livi had been regressing in her sleep and perhaps what I had experienced was a very vivid dream brought on by a lack of sleep. Because apparently, he’s a freaking idiot.

“You’re a freaking idiot!” I snapped at him before storming off.

We didn’t speak to each other for the rest of the day. But by evening time, I was cooled off and actually starting to consider that perhaps he had a point. Livi hadn’t been regressing, but isn’t it possible that going on walks, sometimes for up to an hour in the dead of night, was catching up to me? And that I had some sort of… waking nightmare?? I mean it seemed far fetch, but so did Faceless McGee coming after me and my family so…

That night, after the kids fell asleep, I approached Jake and put my hand on his shoulder. He looked at me, and I touched his cheek, standing on my tiptoes until our foreheads touched. He relaxed, and pulled me into a hug. We learned early in our marriage that neither of us are good about apologizing out loud, so this was our nonverbal way of saying I shouldn’t have lashed out, and we were getting passed it. He pulled me to the bed, where we made love. We then split a bowl of ice cream as we watched one of our favorite comedies together on the couch until about 10:00, when we decided to call it a night.

I went to bed feeling optimistic. I double checked on both of the kids and made sure all the windows and doors were locked, but I had actually managed to convince myself that I had perhaps imagined the whole thing.

I, too, am a freaking idiot.

There was no noise to wake me later that night. That’s another thing that scares me when I think back. There was no clear indication anything was wrong. The house was silent and dark when my eyes suddenly shot open. But somehow I still knew… something was wrong.

Elijah’s room. I had to get to his room. Now.

I hurried into the room and threw open the door. I was not surprised to see a tall woman looming over his bed, her back to me as she reached for him. Her long, spidery fingers pulling back his Super Mario bed covers.

“DON’T YOU TOUCH HIM!” I shrieked at the top of my lungs. 

Again, I believe the element of surprise is what saved me. She hadn’t expected me to catch her. I reached for the light switch, but she was gone before light flooded the small bedroom. Eli was sitting up, rubbing sleep from his eyes. Livi was crying in the next room. And Jake was lumbering into the room behind me, slurring “who’s there? I have a weapon,” as he brandished an old slipper like a sword.

In a split second decision, I decided this wasn’t the time for the truth. Not with my baby crying, my four year old looking at me with fear filling his big, blue eyes, and my husband swinging around a slipper and demanding the intruder come out and fight like a man.

I quickly blurted out that I was so sorry, I had a nightmare. And it must have been the ice cream! No more ice cream right before bed, heh heh!

I made sure Jake had woken up enough to stop wacking the clothes in Eli’s closet with the slipper, and then (after many apologies for waking everyone) I asked him to lay down with Eli, who immediately cuddled up to his daddy, while I went to console Olivia. Soon, the whole house was back to a peaceful sleep… except me.

My children’s rooms are right next to each other. I kept both of their doors open and planted myself in a chair in the hallway, making sure I could see both of their beds from where I was sitting. And that’s where I’ve been every night since that incident.

My new routine is that I pretend to go to bed beside Jake. I wait to hear his steady snores, and then I go to the safe where he keeps his gun. I take it with me to my chair in the hallway, and I watch. And I wait.

Tonight will be my second night of this and I feel myself fading. I have energy drinks, coffee, even caffeine pills. But at some point, the human body will just crash. And I think that’s what she’s waiting for, and I don’t think my raw maternal rage will be enough to scare her off this time.

Please, if anyone has any information about this woman or how to stop her… I’m begging you. How do I kill this thing? I need to know NOW.

Because she can’t have my babies. She just can’t. I will die stopping her, and I’m starting to accept… that’s very likely to be what will happen if I don’t get some answers.

Please help me. Because as I’m writing this, I’m feeling my head dropping and my eyes closing. I can’t stay awake much longer…

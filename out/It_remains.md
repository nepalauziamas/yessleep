It first arrived around 10pm BST, it was just there. Lurking on the path, just outside our garden.

We have a well kept garden, a bit overgrown in some places but its big and I'm the only able bodied person in the house. But when it arrived. The grass started dieing. The leaves fell from the tree. The bushes withered away. The garden quickly succumbed to his presence. 

I ignored this. Put it down to my own delirious mind playing tricks on me, after all I was tired. Exhausted even. But I woke this morning at around 5am. It was almost sunrise and I could see a slither of light creeping over the horizon. To reassure myself it was nought but a dream, I checked where it last stood. The grass was as dry as the Sahara. The tree had all but collapsed. The bushes were empty husks of what they used to be. Nothing more than a vast maze of twigs ascending from the ground.

I am not some dumbass in a horror film, I decided the best course of action is to stay away from it. I can't call the cops, technically its not done anything illegal - yet. I don't fancy confronting it, it towers over our hedge, which is almost 6 ft tall. Its features are unrecognisable and impossible to make out. 

To be safe I invested in a camera, installed it overlooking where it stood and set up a live feed in my room. A costly endeavour but one that payed off. I could now watch it day and night.

Time passed. By 11pm the sun had fell and it was still lurking there. It had remained perfectly still, staring at my window, for a full day now. Sleep felt like an impossibility. How could I rest when this thing simply waits for me outside? 

I forced myself to sleep another night. This time of unrest and fear. This thing now haunted my dreams. It was as though it followed me everywhere. Even now I know its there and whats to stop it from simply being... here. 

When I awoke the camera feed was nothing but static. In a fit of panic I jumped up, rapidly dressed myself with the first articles of clothing I could find. I had to check it was still there. I had to check that it had not left. Or worse... I hurried over to the window I watched it from before. The camera was just underneath, but something was wrong. The wires appeared to have been severed, quite cleanly, by a blade. None of the footage was recoverable. All I had was the footage I'd already backed up. A short clip of it simply standing and staring. And a longer clip of what appeared to be nothing.

I left for work around 9am. This thing wasn't there anymore. It had left. Or moved. Either way, it appears to be leaving us alone now.

Work was a drag, as always, and I tried to finish early to get a chance to leave early. I wanted - nay - needed to see this.

Upon returning home i headed straight for my room. I needed to see where it was. I peered out of the window. Nothing. I searched everywhere I frequent and never found a thing. I wanted to stay up and figh ifBy 2am my body was catching up with me. I could hardly keep my eyelids open, let alone defend the house, so I devoted myself to rest for the remainder of the night. It would be gone by the morning. Surely...

It remains. 

The time is now 2:38pm and I intend to document it as much as possible. Any suggestions with how to proceed is greatly appreciated

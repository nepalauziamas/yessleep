I closed my eyes as I entered the room and slammed the door in the face of that abomination. I was tired, and nearly lost hope of my life ever returning to how it was. I had no idea what was going on outside of the wilderness we had been exploring, it may have even ended for all I knew. The only thing that mattered was that *my* world had gone to shit at only 15 years old.

I kept my eyes closed for god knows how long, but then all sound faded. I opened them, there was just a black void around me with absolutely nothing illuminated. Hell, I couldn't even see my own hands in front of me.

As I turned around to see what was behind me, there was a television on a table. I walked up to it extremely confused, and then it flashed on after a series of screen glitches. Text appeared on the screen, I'll put what I saw below, and I'll try to recreate it to the best of my ability.

After the text finished, the TV turned to static, and the loud white noise broke the silence.

I stood there confused, what even was that? Who was the text referring to? Who is "They"? Why am I here? But I had little time to contemplate as I heard pounding on the door behind me, and I was suddenly back in the room that I entered. The creature was trying to get in so I ran as far as I could through the next door before slamming it shut.

When I entered the door, I was in another strange void, this time, it was an open area with clouds below my feet. I wasn't on the clouds though, oh no, I was **above** them and somehow walking on the air itself.

I looked around only to see nothing else, just endless clouds before I began falling and landed face-first onto a cold floor. I looked up and I saw the elevator I used to enter the abandoned complex beneath my dad's house. I was in this complex at the entrance. I pressed the button to call it as I didn't want to experience that mess again.

The elevator arrived and I stepped inside, relieved that it had actually come. The doors closed as the light for it began to flicker on and off.

I heard the ***ding*** of the elevator as I was back in the basement of that house. Why was everything somehow tied to the place where I first entered into this madness?

Anyway, I stepped out into the basement, and I got the feeling that something was… off. I decided to open the door that led in from the outside, only to be somehow even more confused with what I saw outside. There weren't any trees, there were no paths, no snow, just an empty, featureless white void.

I quickly closed the door, not wanting to see that void again, and went upstairs again. There were no lights turned on inside the house, but it was still lit up by the thin whispers of light that crept in through the closed curtains. I went over to the front door of the house and ran straight into a brick wall.

I was suddenly back in the real world again, and I heard a voice speaking to me in that familiar Russian accent; it was Vova. "Samantha, where the hell are you?" I responded, "To be entirely honest I don't know. I have no idea where the fuck I am or what is even happening, I keep leaving this reality somehow." "...Shit. I think I know what's happening." "Well, what's going on then? If I'm gonna spend the rest of my life this way then I had better know what the hell I'm dealing with."

He paused for a moment, he then continued, "I can't really say everything right now, but this isn't what you may be perceiving. That strange world was made from the depths of your memories, take whatever..." he then faded out, and I was back in that strange ethereal reality.

The front door was now opened, leaving me wondering why this was even happening. Along with this, a new indescribable feeling took over me, and I entered an almost trance-like state of mind. This compelled me to walk out into the void, and I kept walking on the path I chose for what felt like hours before I actually got somewhere. There was a single blue-colored door that appeared with nothing else surrounding it.

The trance-like state broke and I decided that I needed to leave this void. I entered only to see... well... my mom's house. It was just as I had left it when this whole mess began.

I walked around for a bit and found my mom! Well, it wasn't *really* her now that I look back on it, as it was probably just a reflection of her. "Hey," I spoke aloud, no answer. "Hey," again, no response, "HEY!" I shouted out, but she didn't even react.

I was confused as hell, and I began trying to touch her to get her attention, but my hand just passed straight through her. I tried everything, I even tried to harm her but nothing worked. I just went over to a couch and sat down, coming to terms with the fact that this was essentially my "new normal" for the time being.

That's when a voice broke the silence.

"She doesn't miss you, don't you see her? You're nothing more than a helpless child with your grown-up friends too busy fighting their own beasts to come help you. And look, she doesn't give a damn!"

The voice was hard to describe, it was like both a male and female voice at the same time and in unknown accents.

"N... no. This isn't... this can't be" "What's wrong, little girl? Scared? Hehe, it's a tad bit too late for that don't you think?" Even though I know now that the voice was lying, it was like a wasp sting to the uvula at the time.

"Shut up, SHUT UP!!!" I shouted as I stood up, deeply hurt and offended. I wandered around while the voice mocked me for all of my failures so far, but then I found a polaroid camera on the kitchen table. I lifted it up, and for some reason, I felt like I had to have it with me.

I began to walk upstairs when I stopped, I noticed that in the window, there was a figure watching me. It was a red humanoid that was mostly obscured by the void along with some unseen fog. [I managed to snap a photo of it](https://imgur.com/RDISXse), and I also took the original and produced [an edited variant](https://imgur.com/a/q3DtuXk) to make the figure more visible (you can thank my dad for teaching me how to do that, but that isn't important right now).

The figure faded once I photographed it, but I still knew that it was just behind me for practically my entire time in the twisted reflection of my mother's home. I couldn't take it anymore at one point and just went to grab any form of weapon.

But then, I was not in that home anymore, rather, I was in a room that resembled the typical movie screens you would find at theaters. At this point, I was almost ready just to collapse and accept my new fate, almost all of my hope was gone anyway. But then, a new voice cut through the silence that almost resembled the one I heard mere minutes ago, but without the male undertone present.

"Greetings young lady! Would you care to sit back and watch something for a while?" The voice asked me, it had a sickly sweet tone to it.

Without saying a word, I took a seat as far away from that figure as I could. Then the screen began to play a video, it began with a title that read "*What happened to Samantha's mom?*" In a sort of lobster font. My heart sank as the video began to play. It showed my mom in bed as she got up and went into the kitchen, she then started pouring a cup of coffee for herself while she looked noticeably... empty.

It was like the very essence and life she had left was sucked out of her. I began to feel repulsed as I watched because as much as I despised her for leaving my dad, it still hurt to see her in this state. A large shadow began to form behind her as she finished pouring, it was 8 feet tall with the same antenna and misshapen body structure as the gray men.

That's when she turned around and... oh god, I hate remembering this part, the gray man grabbed ahold of her and sliced into her stomach as she screamed, it then inserted its tongue inside and began to pump its DNA in much the same way as the Skull Horse did to that poor lady a while back.

It then threw her to the ground as the screen cut out, and I was near the point of vomiting. I was left in complete shock at what I saw, my own mother who had brought me into this world was just attacked and transformed as I watched helplessly from an empty array of seats.

A chuckle sounded right next to me, and I knew that it was from the figure. I didn't have to look over, and I just looked down at the floor in front of me.

"You know, if you hadn't gone into that basement, none of this would've happened right?" I felt my eyes begin to sting, "Shut up... You're lying! I... I did nothing wrong that da-" "How could you be so sure? Do you think that it's a coincidence that everything started as you went down there? They followed you back in their incomplete state, and they took another way out. Now look at them, unfinished and clunky, they wander the wilderness because of you. This is all your fault, everything that happened is because of you."

The words of pure malice from this being echoed in my ear, but they felt like a bullet to the heart.

"Really? How can YOU be so sure?" I asked, standing up. The figure audibly smirked and said, "I'm the one who's been after you brat. Don't you get it? I *am* the queen that has been mentioned so much. And you released my subjects into the world before they developed any intelligence, and now you caused this mess, along with me unable to currently emerge from my physical stasis."

It dawned on me, that I was speaking to the queen of this hivemind that had been haunting me.

"What... the... FUCK is wrong with you?!?!" I shouted as I turned to face her, "WHY HAVE YOU DONE THIS TO SO MANY PEOPLE, WHY HAVE YOU RUINED SO MANY LIVES?!?!?!?!?!?!"

Another audible smirk from the queen, "Oh, I couldn't have done this without YOUR help, so don't give me all the credit."

I can only really describe what happened next as a blur, as I don't remember exactly what occurred. But I remember being transported to a place that resembled Vova's mansion. I was already over being confused by this point and began to just walk inside. But then a message appeared in my mind somehow, like I was hearing thoughts from someone else's mind.

>DO NOT TRUST HER  
>  
>DO NOT TRUST THIS PLACE  
>  
>FIND THE GATEWAY BACK

&#x200B;

This was... confusing, to say the very least. I wandered around the empty halls of the mansion, as I got truly lost in all of the lavish furnishings. I felt as though this was going to be it, my hope was completely gone by this point as I sat on a random couch.

That's when I fell through the couch, and into another place. I was in a room constructed from some sort of golden material, with a dim blue light that clung to the floor which served as the only light source. And the floor was covered in water that went up to my ankles.

I looked around confused, only to see doorways that led into the exact same rooms and some hallways. There were particles in the air as well, the particles were green in color and floated around aimlessly.

As I looked around, I saw a thin layer of mist clinging to the labyrinth and I began to walk, remembering the message I received before. Then, a cracking sound broke the relative silence. I stopped dead in my tracks and turned around, and there was a creature following me. It was skeletally thin, and by that, I don't mean as in just skinny, oh no, I could see almost its entire skeleton through its skin.

The snout of the best was long and its fangs were only visible from the reflective saliva that coated them. The beast was hairless and was like a 7-foot-tall human-wolf hybrid. It snarled as it began to crouch onto all fours and run towards me, and I took off.

The maze-like structure was disorienting to me as I began to lose track of where I was as I just tried to outrun that thing. The beast then stood up and lunged at me, but then I was back in reality and falling into the concrete floor just as I saw Vova, dad, and Paul running toward me. The last thing I felt before passing back out was the sensation of being lifted off the ground as Vova started carrying me somewhere else, as the other two tried to find some medical supplies.

Yeah, it wasn't a small fall either, I'm still debating whether or not I got a concussion from that or not.

Well anyway, I landed in the weird labyrinth area again and the monster was on top of me. I felt its sharp claws digging in as I desperately tried to pull it off. It began biting and I panicked, I then had an idea. It was a stupid, risky, and deadly idea. I reached for my leg as it began to reposition me, and I removed my shoe.

As it went in for another bite, I jammed my shoe directly into its eye before yanking back.

The monster screamed in agony while holding the mangled mess that was once its left eyeball. I booked it out of there and began wandering the maze. The cuts it made on my chest were large, but they didn't bleed. Well, I was in an alternate world after all.

I wandered the repeating hallways before finding one area that was about 60 feet wide and 40 feet tall; it was another hallway, but something felt unique about it. But before I could move I heard a cracking behind me. I froze up, and I turned around only to see the monster behind me.

The monster's eye was now completely gone, and a trail of fresh blood trickled down the empty socket. In one swift motion, it bent down, twisted its torso a full 180 degrees, and assumed a spider-crawling stance. It then ran at me while laughing as though it were a clown at a birthday party on laughing gas.

I ran down the hallway, but it always followed behind. My legs gave out and I collapsed, but I wasn't ready to give up.

I had been running away from my problems my entire life, and now this thing was making me run even more. I was done. I played dead for a second and watched the disgusting thing look all confused as I laid down limply.

With one hand I then grabbed its jaw and pried it open, and then grabbed the top jaw with my other hand. The monster screamed and thrashed but I didn't care, and I was going to get my revenge.

I began to pull more and more as it screamed, until *pop*! Its jaw fell to the ground and made a splash as it hit the water. I then grabbed the jaw and bashed it in the head.

It screamed as it tried to grab ahold of me, but all in vain as I began to cave its skull in. This freak tried fighting back but I eventually won, and it died in a brutal way.

I then began walking along the hallway, and I walked, and I walked. The surroundings though... they slowly changed into something. They became darker, and then eyes began decorating the halls.

Then, the voices, oh god the voices. They whispered of everything I had done up to this point, pointing out my every sin, telling me of how it was all my doing, and other things that I can only describe as whispers from the devil himself. I began moving on as the voices got louder and louder, but I reached the light eventually and the voices died out.

The light consumed my vision, and I then woke up in a makeshift bed within a mineshaft. Vova and Paul were talking while dad was leaning over me. 

"Oh god... you're awake!" He shouted, "Yes, I am." I said in an almost stone-cold way. I knew where we were going next. Vova then said, "Huh, not like you. Did something ha-" "I was in the alternate realm." I interrupted. "I know some things, one is that mom will never come back the same again, and the second is what the queen is. She told me that she's in a state of stasis."

"Huh, well now we-" "Dad, I'm not done yet. I think I know where to go, and I know where she is at." I don't remember the chunk of memory I lost, but I knew that we were nearing our final destination.

Paul then said, "But Samantha, what do yo-" "We're getting closer to their hive, I can feel it in my body, I can sense the queen being kept in a developing body... wires... I see endless wires and tubes." I said, but then a new voice cut through the silence.

"Well, you are right about that Samantha." Jack's voice echoed through the cave halls.

"What the..." "Yes, I know Samantha that I might be a bit scary, but I have regained control over myself for a bit." He said, in a casual tone of voice. "Listen, I am speaking over a microphone so that way Charles doesn't hunt me down too, but you're right about one thing: you're getting close to the main facility--the hive. In fact, this is the last place you will need to go before getting there, but this place is highly dangerous."

I looked into the caverns and then responded, "I'm ready to do what it takes. even if it means ending my own life."

Vova looked down at the ground, and he had that sad look on his face. "Well Samantha, something you should know is... well..." He then paused, before continuing, "Part of my transformation life-linked me to the queen of their hive, so if she dies then I die too."

He inhaled shakily, "I've made plenty of mistakes in my nearly centuries-long life, and stopping her might be my last, but I would rather die than spend the rest of my life knowing that I never even tried."

I looked at Vova, and then the caverns again, then I stood up and began hugging him. He had a look of confusion and asked, "What..." but then I responded, "In case we never see you again, thank you for everything." He then paused, then smiled, hugged back, and responded, "I won't be gone forever, you will see me again someday."

Jack then spoke again, "Alright, are you prepared for this?" We all turned to each other and nodded, "Yes, we are ready sir."

Jack then made a final announcement, "Well then, here we go. It's time to end this all."

“The sun sets fast these days,” Aslaug said in a croaking voice, between two sips of mulled wine. She had been eyeing me in silence from across the massive kitchen table as I picked my itinerary for the next day. "You don't wanna get trapped out there after dark, is what I mean."

Well, duh, Captain Ominous. I placed a heavy ladle at one corner of the faded map in an effort to flatten it.

I sincerely intended to play it safe. While I couldn’t afford a guide, I figured I wouldn’t even need one if I just stuck to a local loop.

Obviously, it would have been safer not to go alone, but my new friends had kinda let me down the day before. This whole story happened the year my parents divorced, right after I left for college. I had convinced some girls from my Parisian university to explore Norway together during our winter break. We kept our expenses low by couchsurfing and eating a balanced diet of fish pudding and Freia chocolate milk. But by the time we reached Bergen, everyone else was tapped out, tired of wearing ski pants, and ready to go home.

I, however, had no plans to see family for the holidays. Not even to test whether divorcing parents give you twice as many Christmas gifts, as the legend goes.

So while my friends took a loser train back to France, I hitchhiked to Evanger, a village famous for its hiking trails. There I booked the cheapest lodging I could find, in a farm at the edge of town. The room counted two narrow bunk beds for one shower; but I was, mercifully, the only current guest. I even had access to the rest of the house.

Aslaug took another sip. Whiffs of cooked red wine and cardamom mixed with the scents of various herbs, suspended upside down from the wooden beams. The overhead lamp failed to properly illuminate the old map she had handed me; but the kitchen boasted both a stove and a wi-fi relay, so it was worth making an effort to be social.

“I’ll be fine,” I said. “I’m used to doing stuff alone.” I had been on snowshoe walks with my grandparents, when they were still alive. How hard could it be?

Looking up from her drink, Aslaug glared at me. “Just because you think you are alone, doesn’t mean you are.”

That felt way too personal. I shifted on my bench, which protested loudly, and muttered, “Everyone else had better plans.”

Aslaug’s wrinkled eyes narrowed. I pretended to focus on my own fuming cup. What did she even want from me?

“Well, since you’ve made up your mind, you’ll take my snowshoes and walking sticks.”

My head snapped up. Didn’t see that coming. I thanked her awkwardly, but she dismissed my protests. “I insist, young girl”, she said with a smirk. “Take the map as well.” She stood and made for her room, her slippers shuffling on the tiled floor.

“And if you find that you don’t need no map, no sticks, and no snowshoes either, I guess you can just throw them away,” she added in a practical tone, glancing at me over her shoulder.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Shortly before dawn, I left the house as quietly as I could, and found my trail at the edge of a sparse birch forest. As I stopped to fidget with Aslaug’s ancient snowshoes, I noticed someone observing me.

An albino cat had wandered out of nowhere, and trotted towards me when I met his bright reddish eyes. His fluffy tail waved like a little flag above the snowdrifts. I petted him for a few minutes, and got on my way, the snowshoes creaking like a rusty box spring. Undeterred, the cat followed me. He must have weighed next to nothing; he barely left any imprint on the snow. But despite his obvious advantage, he meowed loudly when I picked up the pace.

Little freeloader could probably smell my sandwich or something.

"Okay, fur-face," I said, rolling my eyes but secretly delighted. I removed my hood, and fashioned a handy "kitty bag" to carry him in. The trail climbed up a steep slope, and I already sweated despite the freezing morning air.

With Fur-face purring on my hip, we strolled by a whole catalog of winter wonderland clichés. Bergen’s region is famously cloudy, and the air was sharp with the smell of fresh snow. Yet on that morning, the sky was wide open. The pale sunlight sparkled on frozen twigs, and reverberated on white meadows. The firs’ dark green needles provided the only contrasting color in the mineral landscape. It was glorious.

Winter had suspended nearly all animal activity. I heard a woodpecker, doing what woodpeckers do high up in a skeletal oak. A few plump tits took flight, long before we arrived at the edge of a field. The lack of prey made it unlikely that a cat could survive off the land through the winter. Maybe someone in Evanger kept Fur-face as a pet? He had no collar or tattoo, though.

We didn’t meet anyone else on the trail either, save a few farms in the distance. Most tourists probably preferred to discover the fjords on pre-paid tours. After weeks of sharing cramped guest rooms and riding public transportation, I relished the open space and endless possibilities.

We had lunch next to a half-frozen waterfall. And since I’m a wuss like that, I let Fur-face eat most of my First Price sandwich. I would pick a few morsels of, um…whatever kind of protein that was, and hold them out to him on my fingertips. He dropped half of them in a puddle though, and bit me pretty hard in the process.

I didn't care. This hike was everything I could have asked for. I even snapped a few pictures to taunt my friends; but my smartphone had no signal that far away from civilization. I would have to send them when we got back to Evanger.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We had been out for four hours, and blue shadows stretched upon the snowy underwood of the pine forest we were crossing. Fur-face walked a few steps before me. Carrying him this whole time had given me a side stitch.

I was starting to doubt my course. Instead of turning down to the valley like it was supposed to, the track lingered through the firs. Some of the markers looked like they had been scratched off, either intentionally or by some wildlife damaging the trunks. Was I even still on the loop?

Hesitantly, I removed my gloves, and dug out Aslaug’s map. In the filtered sunlight, I could barely read it. I turned around to catch a better look - and tripped on the cat which, in true feline fashion, had picked the worst time to rub against my legs. He gave a blood-curdling shriek and darted between my feet. I fell on my back. My palm cut open on something sharp.

"Damn it, cat!" I yelled, looking around for him. He had vanished in the underwood.

I stood up on shaky legs, my pants damp with snow and mud, my hand burning more intensely with every second. "Cat? Psspspss,” I called.

Silence. The forest remained perfectly still. Dark trunks surrounded me.

I was all alone in the wild.

I mean, of course, I had been "alone" the whole time. But I hadn't felt like it until then.

A brutal, overwhelming sensation of vulnerability enveloped me, and settled deep in my bones.

I tried again to call after Fur-face - like that ever helps with cats. My voice sounded brittle and intrusive in the frozen landscape.

I picked up the map and walking sticks, but my gloves were soaked and muddy. No way I was putting them back on my scraped hands. As I fumbled in the dusk, I realized that I couldn't afford to waste more sunlight. If the track didn't branch soon, I would need to turn around.

The noises began right after I started walking again. They were just faint sounds at first. Normal sounds. Branches cracking. Twigs shifting against a trunk. The wind whistling in the trees? Snow fell from a branch overhead - but what disturbed it? I hadn’t seen nor heard a bird in hours. I strained my ears, trying to listen over the racket of the stupid snowshoes. Maybe I hadn't noticed how loud the forest was. Maybe I was getting a little dizzy, what with all that exercise and my subpar lunch and the blood now dripping from my fingers onto the walking sticks.

There was no rationalizing it away though. I just knew. Somehow, I could feel it. Something, or someone was following my every step. Like, not far behind me. Hidden among the firs. Stalking me.

Adrenaline spread through my veins. I could feel the pressure moving through my jaw, racing down my thighs. My stomach clenched. But I didn't dare observe my surroundings too closely, even less turn back.

So I kept walking. The light grew dimmer. And the sounds grew louder.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Cold sweat trickled down my spine, and I shivered. But I was too unnerved to pause and put my hood back on. More and more trees looked damaged, their bark lacerated, branches torn apart. On one of them, I could discern the markings of four gigantic claws. They were etched distinctly on a trunk a few steps away; yet I could barely register what I was looking at. What was this, “Jurassic Park - the Christmas edition”?

In an attempt to conceal my growing panic (but from who?) I casually unfolded the map again, and tried to read it while picking up the pace. Have you ever pretended to call a non-existent boyfriend while hurrying through a deserted parking lot, loudly confirming that “yes, I’ll be here in 10 minutes” just so that the creep following you would hear? Same thing.

It definitely was just for show too. Blood and melted snow had utterly ruined the map. A sharp crack, somewhere on my left, made me lurch forward. My panic and frustration were turning into blind fury.

“Oh come *on*!” I grunted, throwing the useless map behind my shoulder. My voice rang clear this time, and was immediately followed by the resounding crash of water onto rocks. I was so startled I turned around, half tripping over my snowshoes.

Two or three steps behind me, a raging torrent was running across the forest. Starting way up the slope, its wild streams smashed into the pines below, cutting the path I had crossed mere seconds ago. It was as if a dam had broken, waters sweeping away everything in their path - and ensuring I couldn’t turn back.

That wasn’t why I screamed though.

On the other side of the torrent… Look, I will attempt to describe it, but you won’t believe me, and I won’t blame you, because it’s pretty ridiculous.

It was, to put it bluntly, an enormous cat. It was looking down at me, slanted eyes glistening in the dusk. Its outstretched claws left long rakes in the mud. Deep in the shadows, I saw its raised tail twitch. I couldn’t make out the rest of its gigantic body, because it was flat on the ground, in a prowling position.

Hunting me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I don’t remember starting to run. I had left the path, and half tumbled, half glided down the slope, my lungs on fire, when the crash of uprooted trees made the ground rumble. The chase was only beginning. Cats, of course, are excellent jumpers - and even such a formidable obstacle as the torrent could only have slowed him down.

Carried away by my momentum, low branches whipping my face and arms, I could only pray that I wasn’t headed straight to a cliff. The rough, dark trunks extended indefinitely below and around me, unrelenting, unforgiving, concealing any horizon beyond the steep slope. Still running, I looked around desperately for a place to hide, a diversion, anything - when I glimpsed a metallic sheen behind the trees, far away on my left.

A car. It had to be a car. I remembered from the map that a road meandered through the woods down to the village.

“Help! Please!” I yelled in a broken voice. Giving away my position. Like a moron. The sounds of the chase above me immediately changed direction.

That sobered me up. If the car was on my left, the road might be crossing the forest somewhere below me. Jumping over gnarled roots, I peered at my surroundings. A denser patch of pines expanded in front of me - but it seemed there was an opening on the other side, which meant… if I was fast enough…

I never even saw the trunk I collided with.

My head rang, and pain shot through my nose. The blow to my chest left me breathless. I could still hear it behind me though, getting closer. The thrashing of an enormous mass pouncing towards me, and a deep, cruel growl that seemed to rise from the earth itself.

“No no no nonononono”

I scrambled to my unsteady feet, yanking the walking sticks from under a branch - when inspiration struck me. I lifted the sticks, took a deep breath, and threw them askew over my shoulders.

A furious roar resonated through the forest.

I dared to look. A long line of massive, sharpened wooden poles had sprouted from the ground. They stood close together, and as tall as the pines around them. Trapped on the other side, the monster growled again. It sounded like that high-pitched ninja cry that cats sometimes do when they fight? A savage blow shook the barricade on its entire length.

I didn’t wait for whatever came next. Still groggy, my chest aching, I made as fast as I could for what I prayed was the road. I couldn’t hear anything over the creature throwing all its weight against the poles.

Another glint of metal on my left, below me, much closer this time. The road couldn't be far, the trees opened up on a snowdrift a hundred steps ahead. Oh God, oh God, please please please…

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

If I had spilled on the pavement an instant later, the battered truck would have run me over. I threw myself in its way, my arms extended, forcing it to stop. Its driver, a 60-something burly man, passed his head on the window and yelled at me in Norwegian as I tucked at my snowshoes.

“Wait! Wait! Please wait!” I begged, making sure to block the road.

No time for the straps, I kicked off my hiking shoes instead. The pavement felt cold but blessedly solid under my wet socks.

“Girl, what are you doing?” My rather-would-not-be rescuer had switched to English. A resounding crash echoed through the woods and made us both look up. I knew what was coming. I picked up my snowshoes, turned around and - facing the driver who looked at me like I was somehow the craziest thing here - threw them over my shoulders.

From the driver’s expression, I knew it had worked before I checked. A large net of sturdy, thick ropes expanded between the close-knit pines. My shoes were caught in it, dangling near a branch.

Honestly, I felt like this was the less spectacular one of the three, but it did stop the monstrous cat when it plunged into it seconds later. With another shrill meow, it immediately started slashing at the ropes.

I rushed to the passenger’s door and climbed in the truck, my backpack forcing me to hunch over. The driver barely noticed; he couldn’t take his eyes off the creature, a look of pure awe and horror etched on his face.

“Let’s go! Go go go go go!” I screamed, shaking his shoulder. Thankfully, he came out of his trance and started the engine with a bang. The truck lurched forward. I struggled to close the door, get rid of my bag, and find the seatbelt.

We were indeed well on our way to a car crash - the driver wasn't even looking at the road. His eyes were riveted to his rearview mirror, and with his right hand he searched the glove compartment. The car swerved and I let out a yelp as I slid sideways. My eyes locked on the mirror. The road behind us was now engulfed in an expanding cloud of powdery snow, racing to the treetops. I made out the shape of the beast. It was bracing for a sprint.

"Here! Take this!"

My head snapped back. The driver stared at me intently, his face pale and sweaty. He shoved something into my hands. The thuds of gigantic paws hitting the pavement resonated in the distance.

"Take it!", he yelled. He pressed on my bleeding palm and I grunted, looking down. It was a pair of gloves, apparently right out of the shop. They still had a tag on. “What the f…”

"It’s a gift! A Christmas gift! For you! Take them, put them on! Right now! Now!", he repeated, squeezing my hands blindly as he tried to straighten out the wheel.

"Okay, okay, jeez!" I yelled back as I put them on, wincing. I held my hands up to show him I’d complied. The whole truck shook, metallic clinks signaling the creature’s rapid approach.

But that still ranked low on my driver’s sense of priorities. “And what’s the magic word?”

“The what?” I squealed, incredulously.

“Say the magic word!” he barked at me.

“Oh my God, what? Thank you?”

"You’re welcome", he grumbled, his eyes on the road, hands on the wheel, preparing to take a sharp turn. My whole body bracing for a lethal shock, I risked a glance in the rearview mirror.

The road stood empty.

Stray swirls of snow fell silently to the ground.

But right before we turned, I saw a small, fuzzy shape crouching on the pavement. A pair of glowing reddish eyes briefly reflected the car's back lights.

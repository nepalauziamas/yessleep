A quick backstory, I live with my grandparents due to my father and mother not wanting to take care of me. When I was about 9 or 10 I woke up in the middle of the night to go use the bathroom. As I'm walking down the hallway I see the bathroom light is already on, getting closer I see my grandfather in the bathroom.

He's standing in the middle of the room with has his arms to his side and he's staring at the wall. I tell him I was surprised to see him awake this late, but he doesn't respond. Feeling a little freaked out I ask him if he's ok, but still no response. I get closer and see his deadpan facial expression and I slightly shake his arm asking him again if he's alright and that's when I notice that he's not even blinking.

I run to go wake up my grandmother telling her there's something wrong, she rushes over to the bathroom yelling my grandfather's name shaking him but he just stands there. My grandmother immediately calls 911 while scream and trying to get any response from my grandfather. 

As a kid I dont really understand whats going on I have never seen anything like this before. At this point I don't know how long he was like this before I found him but it was about 40 minutes for emergency services to arrive.

As paramedics prepare to take him away he turns his head and ask what's going on. To all of our shock he's responding again. We ask him whats going on but he just acts confused and says he's fine. He refuses to go to the hospital despite my grandmother telling him that he really needs to go.

After the paramedics leave he just goes back to sleep like nothing happend. In the morning no one talked about what happened and everything went back to normal until about 4 months later when he was diagnosed with brain cancer. He died shortly after on 05/21/15. 

I forgot this happened until thinking about him recently. As a kid I didn't understand how truly terrifying this was. Yelling out to someone right in front of you and no matter how loud you are they can't hear you.





This is 100% a real story that happened to me. I feel like I don't need to explain that but this sub has a 500 word limit so I'm going to add some details about him here because I don't want to over explain the story. Feel free to stop reading because this has very little to do with the story.

My grandfather died when he was 47, he liked fishing, workshopping, photography, sky diving, and creating. He loved making things like wooden carvings, paintings, taking old toys from the 90s apart and putting them back together to make something new. He was really good at building sheds and even built our front porch. He was an amazing guy and I'm sad to see him gone.

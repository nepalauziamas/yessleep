There were fields I visited as a child. My home had many acres, with many little fields spreaded all throughout the property. As I explored when I was younger, I began to encounter people in these fields. Now almost all of them were very kind. I was often offered gifts by them and I’d received a handful of them from some of these people. It was only in hindsight as I grew up that I realized none of these people should’ve ever even been there in the first place. 

&#x200B;

This was nearly 20 years ago now and I’d all but forgotten about the child experiences of the people in the fields. But I’m writing this now because I’m pretty sure they’ve come back. 

&#x200B;

My memories of the people I encountered range from extremely foggy to relatively vivid. Unfortunately the experience I remember the most is the one I remember the most. Oddly enough it was my last experience with the people before they all but disappeared. I was playing explorer deep off on the property. I’d come to a field just outside of a small woodsy area. 

&#x200B;

As I arrived at the field I can distinctly remember having the feeling of being watched. My feelings proved to be accurate as I looked at the woods surrounding me and could see people off in the distance surrounding and closing in on me. I had no direction to go and so I froze, closed my eyes and prayed it was all a dream. I was terrified, beyond belief.

&#x200B;

I then felt a hand rubbing my shoulder. I was petrified but couldn’t help opening my eyes to see who it was. I was shocked when I woke up and only one man was in sight. He was wearing a brown leather jacket. He was rubbing my shoulder in a soothing way. He was looking around the woods surrounding us with a concerned and fearful expression. “Don’t look at them again and you’ll be safe okay?” the man said to me as he rose to his feet. “You have to go back home now, alone. I’d help you but… but it’s best if I stay here.”. 

&#x200B;

There’s one other memory I recall with a decent deal of depth. I was in the closest field to my house on the property, If I looked to my left I could see through the windows into my bedroom. I heard a frog and spent about 5 minutes before I gave up on trying to catch it. Before I’d make the call on whether or not to venture out further that day, I glimpsed at my room. There was a man I didn’t recognize standing in it. He was looking out the window straight into my direction. Now he was at least 100 yards away, but I can still vaguely recall a grin on his face. 

&#x200B;

This scared me immensely but before I could run back to the house a man in an old sweatshirt and strained jeans ran in front of me. There were scabs on his arms and open sores on his face. I almost screamed at the man who to a child looked like the first stage of a zombie infection. “You can’t go back in yet.” The man said to me in an out of breath voice. For some reason he was heavily breathing, like he'd just ran in front of me from a mile away. I disregarded his statement and tried to run around him and get back to my house. But the man ended up blocking me kicked me in the shin. 

&#x200B;

I fell to the ground as I felt the shooting pain. He then stood over me. I guess the rigid kicking motion was too much for his brittle, deteriorating skin because I can still remember seeing one of his scabs fall off and onto my shirt. 

&#x200B;

I feared I was going to be taken away and trapped forever. Kidnapped by an evil zombie of a man. But before he acknowledged me any further, he began running off away from my house. As I got up I could see the man who was standing in my house running with them. 

&#x200B;

I remember running straight into my room with a pounding heart, just to see if anyone was in there. No one was, and nothing seemed to be missing except for a toy wrestler of mine that I only realized was missing the next time I put on a toy tournament. 

&#x200B;

There were many instances with the people that my memories aren’t as clear on, but a firm knowing of the fact that the encounter did take place. The most common thing that was said to me was don’t tell anyone they were there. I listened, I didn’t know I was wrong not to. 

&#x200B;

As I previously mentioned, these events were 20 years ago, my family moved, I grew up, had an education. The people in the fields were for the most part forgotten. But a month ago I had what I believe was my first “second encounter” with one of them. 

&#x200B;

It was around 9pm when I heard a knock on my door. Wednesday night, work in the morning. “Too late to be a package” I thought before getting up and walking to the door. Damned modern apartment expects every resident to have a ring doorbell, therefore no peepholes. 

&#x200B;

I slowly open the door and see an eagerly awaiting man with an uncomfortably big smile on his face. It was like he was trying to tame down the worlds largest grin. Before I could say a word they were nearly shouting “It’s you! It’s really you! I can’t tell you how thrilled I am to see you!”. He shifted his shouting to a soft whisper and then asked “Am I the first to have found you?”. 

&#x200B;

I had no fucking idea what this person was talking about. But as I caught another glimpse of the person's freakish grin I was hit with a burst of deja vu. That’s the first time in nearly two decades that I felt the exact sensations that I felt as a kid in the fields. I slammed the door and shuttered. The memory seemed sinister, and the feeling made my body feel weak.

&#x200B;

I caught one more glimpse of the man through the window as he walked away. I saw tears in his eyes, he looked genuinely destroyed about my response to him. I can’t explain the level of confusion I felt, to be left thinking about dozens of absolutely bizarre and some downright terrifying surprises memories. And then to try and make sense of them while simultaneously trying to figure why they’ve come back! 

&#x200B;

Paranoia grew amongst me immensely at this point, I started to look twice everywhere I went. But I started getting the frequent feeling that I was being observed. My paranoia disproved all delusions however a few days later. I’d just gotten out of the car in my driveway and as I walked to the door I noticed something or someone lying on my doorstep. 

&#x200B;

There was a distinct odor, it penetrated my nostrils and I was immediately hit with a wave of feelings. Terrified, repulsed feelings. The thought of the man in the fields with the scabs and the sores. I walked a little closer only to feel my stomach completely drop. 

&#x200B;

It WAS the man with the scabs. Only, he looked like his body had only continued deteriorating since my encounter as a kid. His face sunken in so deeply it resembled more of a skull. Open sores occupied nearly every part of his head and arms. I wanted to scream but couldn’t make any noise, somehow he still noticed me and began to form a grin like that’ve the first man at my doorstep. I jumped over him and burst into my house as fast as I could, locking all the doors and windows as soon as I got inside. 

&#x200B;

There was one other incident since then, which in all seriousness, seems to have left me more disturbed than anything. As with all the other encounters this one took place at my house. I’d ordered a pizza delivery and got a notification indicating my food had arrived. As I went to pick it up the delivery driver handed the food off but looked at me dead in the eyes. He smiled, a light smile and then oddly asked “May I come in?”. 

&#x200B;

Now I was already in extreme paranoia at this point, so the idea of a random man coming into my home was alarming. I was about to tell him to leave when he said “It’s me, I saved you in the fields.”. It was the man I remembered in the brown leather jacket. The one who saved me from the crowd of people that brought along a sense of impending doom. 

&#x200B;

I remembered the comfort the man provided and I don’t know exactly what it was, but I immediately felt safe allowing him in. The conversation that took place left me raw, defeated, and incomprehensibly broken. I learned something I wish I never did, something I can’t believe I’m still alive after even just knowing. He told me exactly who these people were, or I guess what they are.

&#x200B;

I don’t mean to leave you guys so high and dry as I do feel it’s necessary and pressing for me to get that into the man told me, out to the world. But it’s 11pm as I write this and I’m hearing pebbles being thrown at my window. I hope I can update you guys soon, assuming this pebble situation gets sorted out.

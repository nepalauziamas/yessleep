I’ve read the comments. All of them. I just wish I could say that there was anything I hadn’t tried. I actually tried to get a divorce, but apparently, you can’t divorce the deceased. And you know, she was there when I started looking up ways to sever our connections. She was pissed. I swear to god, I’ve never seen such a mess. She ran around, screaming and destroying anything she could. Wallpaper was ripped from the wall, and dishes were thrown to the ground. It took me two days to stop her rampage, and at that point, she was absolutely paranoid. I couldn’t even leave the room for a second before she’d appear behind me. It took me about a month to calm her down, but I’ve completely strayed away from any tv show that even mentions divorce because it drives her up the wall. 

I called about three priests, and each of them tell me there’s nothing they can do because she’s not a demon. Not an angel, either. They can’t send her to hell, heaven, or anywhere. Now, we were never religious, but I thought at the very least she would react to the priest, but she continued as usual. She tried greeting him, but he didn’t notice her. I guess that was when I should’ve known that they couldn’t do anything to help. I even went away from Christianity, just in case, but the Rabbi couldn’t help and neither could the Imam. 

Eventually, I figured that it might just be me- even though I still had wounds from all of the broken glass I had to clean after her rampage. I talked to a shrink, got my meds, and then they didn’t do anything. I thought they had for a second one morning, but then I heard her walking around downstairs. And at first, I was sure I could live with that. I mean, it sure does cut out the grief. I mean, as soon as the police were at my door telling me she died, I heard her come in through the side door. At that second, I went to the kitchen to greet her, and she looked the same as always. It was only after the viewing that she was different. I was worried she was going to keep devolving, but I guess the cremation stopped that. I honestly thought that after the cremation she would totally be gone, but when I got home she was sitting in the living room. After I set her urn on the mantle, I went to the bathroom but by the time I looked again, it was gone. I asked her about it, and she said she tossed it. I looked in the trash of course, but I couldn’t find it. 

I don’t know why she decided to get rid of her urn, considering she bought it about five months before she died. She saw it when looking for something for her dad and decided it was just the prettiest thing. I found it quite macabre but who am I to judge? Besides, she was always a bit fascinated with the funeral process, even thought about going into the death business.  

But anyways, I know what you really want to know. How did she die? Well, that’s not the most simple question. She wasn’t sick, no, in fact she was as healthy as ever. The problem is I’ve heard three different stories. All of them start the same: On Monday, March 14th, she went out to a bar to have some fun with her coworkers. She left the house around 9:50, though she meant to around 9:30. She was really frazzled that night after a prisoner visiting the hospital escaped under her watch. She wasn’t accused of helping him, of course, but she felt guilty. I told her she might want to just stay home but she was adamant about getting out of the house. But past that, I’ve heard things from her friends, the police, and of course, her.

 Her friends say that she never actually made it to the bar, but because they knew she was stressed they never thought anything about it. But even with that, one of them pulled me aside and said she received a text from Elise around 11. So in other words, she couldn’t have died before then. But the police, who arrived at my doorstep at 12:28 a.m. said she had been dead for about two hours, possibly a bit more. Said they found her car at the side of the street, parked illegally and absurdly. Said that they investigated a bit and found her body discarded only about 30 feet away. Said that she had nine stab wounds, most of them in her torso. Said it looked like there was a struggle, that the killer had even ripped out her nails after- to get rid of DNA, they said. My wife, however, said that she was at the bar, and decided to leave after about an hour. On the walk to her car, someone tried to mug her but she only had a credit card. They tried to steal her wedding ring, but she refused and they eventually stabbed her in the heart. She said she was quite pained for a couple seconds, but then she felt just find. She didn’t know what else to do, so she went home to me. It took her a long time because she had to walk. Now, I wish I could say I believed the police, but in the casket, she had her fingernails and only five wounds. 

I find it hard to believe my wife as well, of course. Her friends say she wasn’t there, and her car was found over thirty minutes away. I wish she’d just be honest with me, but she seems to think she is. I can’t see why she’d want to leave.

Oh goodness. Please, forgive me. I NEED to go. 

She wants to know what I’m writing.

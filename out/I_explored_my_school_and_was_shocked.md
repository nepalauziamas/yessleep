I grew up in a town with a population of around 2,500 people. The town had a very corrupt police force and the town had a massive amount of crime. The town was split into two sides by the Orthodox church. On the East you had a more well-of side (nothing extraordinary) and on the West side you had a very poor, poverty stricken side since the cardboard factory shut down when I started third grade

We had two gangs. A Purple and a Orange gang. The East was Purple and the West was Orange. I grew up on the East side, so even though my family had no gang affiliation we often hid the basement due to fears of gang attacks by the orange gang

My school was in the middle of the city, by the church, but more on the West side. We often went into lockdowns, there were tons of fights, threats, and drugs in and around the school

I will never forget the lock down that happended near Christmas my senior year. Near Christmas the crime always slowed down, as the church was massive and welcomed anyone. The gang attacks also dramatically decreased, but this year it was different

It had snowed heavily the weekend before, and we had to go on lockdown on Tuesday that week. It was bad with tons of shots fired and more. By the time it was called off it was 4 p.m. an hour late off of school. The bodies were gone. My friends decided to check out the place that night and I tagged along

When we got there we noticed a pickup truck and the cafeteria back door was open. We thought it was just supplies, and wanted to see what we were getting for lunch. We noticed a terrible smell when we snuck into the backdoor

We looked around and saw as three of the Orange gang members left the freezer and left the cafeteria. The gangs often helped out the school so we didn't find this odd

We went towards the freezer to see what we were having and we all visibly gasped. There we saw dead, Purple gang members, their clothes taken off. It was clear this was something

The next day we had hamburgers at lunch, and I thought something to my self. I had detention that day as I fought a kid earlier that week

After it I walked to the cafeteria, opened the door to it, walked to the freezer, opened it, a corpse was missing. 

I realized the school never paid for food, that's why it was funded, they were feeding us humans, that caused the weird taste to the meat, that explained everything

I left, shut everything, and drove home, never to talk about it again, to anyone. That was in 2011, and I am now 30. Unfortunately I can't say my life was good after graduation. I fell into the wrong crowd and joined the Purple gang. I've since turned it around and am now taking night classes to become a vet. 

No one believes my story. I always pack my kid's lunch and never want to tell him the horror I saw

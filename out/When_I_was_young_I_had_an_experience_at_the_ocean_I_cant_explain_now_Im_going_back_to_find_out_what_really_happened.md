How should I even begin this journal? I don't know who I'm writing for, and I already know [what happened all those years ago. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/p9sjcl/we_recently_took_a_class_trip_and_i_think_theres/)
Well...yesterday I finalized my purchase of the hotel I stayed at where the fateful school trip happened. I've gotten moderately successful in real estate through my adult life and to be honest, I could very well make a lot of money off this place if I sold it after I fix it up. 

But I'm not going to sell it. I'm here to find out what happened those few days...the voices in the water, that bile spitting fish-human, the apathy of teacher and the hotel owners and how I never saw the girl who was bitten again. For years and years I tried to forget it all. I didn't snorkel much anymore; I didn't even go to the sea, but my old snorkel, custom-made on my Dad's workbench just like the little waterproof flashlight, would turn up in storage now and then and I would think about those events and I would dream of voices and slimy teeth gnawing down among the brine and void of infinite blue, dragging me into the black until cold sweat and disorienting shock greeted me back in a waking world I was not sure was real. Finally I saw the hotel up for sale and my thoughts went back to those memories stained by dark thoughts of writhing abominations. I talked to my therapist and she didn't look at me like I was too crazy, but told me that confronting my fear would probably be the healthiest course of action. 

Damn her. 

So I thought while driving down the road the school bus had taken all that time ago. Now I was gliding in my old orange 240z, arthritis biting the back of my neck, what passed as a beard from a distance on my face, and a scuba license. I had gotten the details from the realtor: the old hotel owner had passed away nine years ago and his wife kept the place up until she disappeared seven months back. The last of their kin, a granddaughter that had moved all the way to Ohio, wasn't interested in an old hotel reeking in that kind of 1910s Americana you find on puzzles and on paintings in lobster restaurants, and listed it for sale as soon as she could. I was the only one to inquire and I'm honestly surprised. The nearest city is only 45 minutes away, and the charming if run-down property is right smack on the coast of that small town of bright colors. It would make a killer property for someone. 

Yeah...some idiot looking for talking fish. 

The orange and indigo clouds of early evening thickened and had begun to drop rain in light drizzles as I drove but it thickened into a heavy assault of gray drops by the time I reached the town. The last bit of sun peeked timidly over the land as I waited on a lonely road for a traffic light barely visible in the downpour. My Z's headlights shone on about half an inch of water, and I fumbled for the umbrella under the never used passenger seat. I could see the dark silhouette of the hotel just beyond, a simple mound of dark blue in the gloom that offered no comfort nor presented any intimidation. It just was there within the sheets of rain, and we stared at each other among dark buildings and steadfast palms.
The light turned green. I shifted into first and cruised to the old hotel's private garage in the horse stable from the earliest days of the establishment. I turned off the engine and was left in the dark with only the drumming of the rain on the roof and the waves not two hundred yards away. I gripped the steering wheel at their sound. This is where it happened...it had been more than two decades since I heard THOSE waves. It took a few moments of breathing in the gloom before I had worked up enough steel in my resolve to grab my backpack and umbrella and leave my car. I closed and locked the garage behind me, rain dripping off the umbrella and down my shirt. I trudged to the hotel, closing my umbrella once I got under the refuge of the front porch. I unlocked the door with my key and pushed it open to a loud creak. I fumbled for the light switch in the dusty dark and flipped it on. 

Slightly yellowed light shone onto a mess. All the furniture was covered in dust, as did the floor. The wood creaked under my steps and rain hammered the roof high above. I sighed and hung my umbrella by the door. I got a flashlight out from my backpack and made my way to the electrical room. Most of the switches were off and I flipped them on. The wall hummed, and I could see the lights in all the rooms come on. I turned back and froze. 

The wooden floor was covered in dust here too. But among the dust were footprints. Not just my own but someone else's shoe marks and several freshly opened cans of chicken and soup. Liquid still shone in the soup can. 

I found a worn wooden cane left in the lobby and raised it. There's a squatter on the premises. I began checking the rooms, searching the closets and bathrooms and under rotten beds. I found more evidence of the squatter but saw nothing. I was walking to a room at the end of the first floor hallway when I heard something crash in a room I had already checked. I hurried back as silently as I could, looking inside to see a chest of drawers fallen to the floor. I moved to go closer but something moved in the walls. I froze as I heard something thumping around inside the walls. It almost sounded like footsteps. They went right past me and down the hallway, and I followed it almost all the way to the lobby before it stopped. I stood still, listening intently. Nothing but the rain above and the old wood settling met my ears. I began to be aware of the settling wood making a sound much like very, very light footsteps. I leaned to the wall and reflexively glanced right to see a child in a red raincoat sneaking up the stairs. 
We made eye contact, round glasses shining beneath their hood, and after that silent moment of shock I shouted. 

"HEY!"

The child darted up the stairs. I thundered up after them. They zipped down the hallway and inside a room, trying to close the door before I got there. I shoved it back open and they jumped away, clambering onto the rotten bed and hoisting a hammer. 

I was breathing heavily. "Who are you?" 

They raised the hammer slightly. We stared each other down awkwardly when wind blasted the hotel. It howled as wind does, but in that howling was that terrible babble of voices I had heard long ago. My skin crawled and my hair stood as I looked up at the roof. Among the noise I heard the creaking in the walls below, and looked to find the child gone. 

The noises were too disturbing to allow me to be frustrated by their departure. They babbled and shrieked for several more seconds and vanished before the wind did. I shuddered and stalked back downstairs. I poked around a bit more before cleaning out one of the suites to be my quarters. I'll have to start cleaning the rest tomorrow, and I'm not looking forward to that with how dirty it is. It's probably gonna take a hundred bottles of Pine Sol before the floors are anything CLOSE to shiny. I also believe I'll take a little drive through town tomorrow, see what people can tell me about what might've happened when I was here last and maybe who my squatter was. Maybe, just maybe.

I'm writing this down a little after 2am. I was awoken by the voices in the wind again and my eyes shot open. I was having a nightmare at the moment it woke me, of a black beach under a blue sun hidden away by pouncing waves dragging me into an abyss of shifting teeth. The voices' screaming jolted my eyes open, and I looked wildly around the room. Thunder shook the hotel and among a group of lightning flashes stabbing through a gap in the curtains and illuminating a hunched, terrible figure like a tumored, wire-haired horror crouching over my backpack in a chair by the bed. I let out a strangled cry and fumbled for the lamp. Turning it on, I only saw the backpack, open and on the floor, and heard that thumping retreat through the walls. I doubt I'm going to go to sleep again now. I need to find the answers to these questions of mine. One night in and I already want to get the hell outta here. 
I'll see what tomorrow brings. For now, they're still screaming.

My current wife and I have had on and off 
relationships since we were fresh into High School. What had started out as a one night stand in a parking lot somehow ended in a family with our own son five years down the road. However, back in November of 2020, we’d come to the conclusion that getting our own place was the best course of action, and that we did. A small 2-bed, 1-bath apartment was absolutely perfect for a young couple, it was just missing one piece: a furry friend.  

Sebastian came to our home in January
 of 2021, and boy was he a treat. At about four months of age at the time, he was as playful as ever. Hell, you could throw a pillow at him and he’d be just as happy with it as a new toy. The best parts were the hide-and-seek games he learned to play, especially at night given that he was a black cat. He loved to be pet all the time and wanted almost as much attention as my wife. At the time, he was one of the best additions to my life. 

A few months later, we found out that our first son, Jonathan, would be meeting us around December the same year. Ecstatic and scared as a young couple could be, we nervously prepped everything: diapers, converted one of the rooms to a baby room, baby-proofed all of the corners, etc. During this time, Sebastian was as any normal house cat could be. If you wanted to get playful, he’d gladly accept of course. Other than that, provided he had a place to eat, shit, and sleep, he was good to go. Frequent baths about once a month, constant grooming, litter box being changed daily, if not more, and a bunch of other things. He was, by all means, thoroughly took care of. 

Jonathan came a little early, around November of 2021. Sebastian was very nervous to be around him; rarely came within three or so feet, ran the other way when the crying started, and would just generally try to not be involved. Over the course of about two weeks of him being home, he warmed up considerably. Snuggling with him, coming to comfort him when the crying started, and wherever Jonathan was, he was right beside him. We thought this was great behavior as we had always wanted for our son to have a best friend growing up. We were completely wrong. 

The trouble started two months ago. Jonathan woke up in a fit of rage ready to eat again after four hours of sleep. No big deal, every parent knows this. Make the formula, pop the bottle in some warm water to get it to body temps, and the baby munches away. Sebastian, however, was nowhere to be found. We ran the normal routine of making the bottle, but for some reason, Jonathan wouldn’t take it. Screaming at the top of his lungs was something we haven’t heard him do before, so it really threw us for a loop. After a few minutes of holding and rocking he finally calmed down enough to take the bottle and went right back to sleep, as did we. 
The following morning, Sebastian was back in his normal spot on the windowsill, swiping the window at the birds flying by. My wife Sarah and I contemplated why Jonathan was screaming so bad the night before, and after looking around for anything that may be upsetting him, we came up empty handed. So, we forgot about it. That same night, however, it happened again. This time, we found Sebastian in the corner of the room hiding behind a rocking chair just…staring. He tracked us all the way through the room with what felt like him counting each and every one of our steps. Once we reached Jonathan in his crib, Sebastian started growling at us, aggressively. Although we were confused, we dropped it, took care of our son, and went back to sleep before the next wake-up time. 

An hour and a half later, we awoke to the sound of blood-curdling screams. We nearly broke the hinges off of doors trying to get to his room, only to find nothing. He was still asleep, Sebastian was curled in the rocking chair, all was well as far as we could tell, so we brushed it off as a bad dream and made it back to bed. Somehow the coincidence here didn’t come up, and we nodded off once again. This time, about an hour later, I was the only one to wake up. I had heard it again, but this time, it was like the sound was coming from our room. I jumped up from the bed half asleep ready to swing at whatever was making the sound, and of course, I didn’t hear it again. I assumed it was Sarah and gently tapped her to wake up. She angrily asked what I wanted and I quietly asked if she was having a nightmare. Shaking her head “no”, she rolled back over to go back to sleep. I, on the other hand, had a chilling sensation that something was watching me. I fumbled on the nightstand looking for my phone, and when I did, I clicked on the flashlight to be sure there was no one in the room with us. Completely empty. However, just as I was laying back down I spotted something that made every muscle in by body tense. Sebastian was standing in the doorway to our room standing completely still, and staring directly at me. The only problem was that his eyes weren’t reflecting. They were solid black, and he almost appeared to be smiling. My eyes couldn’t adjust to what I was seeing so I flicked off the light on my phone, then back on again, and he was gone. No sound or anything, not to mention he has a bell on his collar, so this was very unusual, and honestly fucking terrifying. I couldn’t sleep afterwards, and stayed up for quite a while. 

Five p.m. eventually rolled around and I was off to work. Kissing Sarah goodbye, I sternly told her to keep an eye on Sebastian and to call if anything weird happens. Work was, well, work…full of surprises and bullshit coworkers. Right around 11:30 p.m. that night, I got a call from my wife. I answered, however before I could say anything, she said, “Get the fuck home NOW!” It was by far the most terrified I’ve ever heard her be, and after quickly telling my boss I had to go, I was home within ten minutes. I didn’t even have enough time to get the car door open all the way before I saw the silhouette of something large, very large, walk past the window. It was heading in the direction of the bedrooms, and wasn’t moving very fast. I pulled the .45 caliber pistol I always had beneath the seat and quietly shut the door of the car and walked my way up slowly. 
       
The door to the apartment was slightly ajar, but not wide enough to see clearly inside. Thankfully I’d greased the hinges of all the doors the week prior so it made no sound as I pushed it open with my pistol drawn. Knuckles white from grip, I turned on the flashlight attached to it and aimed around the living room. Somehow the lights had all went out before I made it into the apartment. I hadn’t noticed them going out on the way over to the door. It was quiet inside, too quiet. No sounds at all, from the wind outside, little critters in the grass, the creaking of wood, absolutely nothing, only my breathing. 

“You’ve made a mistake coming here tonight, human,” it said with such calmness it chilled straight to bone. The voice was raspy, airy, with sounds of teeth clattering, and spoke with such deep tones it was almost inaudible. “All you had to do was stay away for some time and all you’re to witness here tonight wouldn’t stain your memory.” Then it moved, but this time with such speed and agility that I couldn’t even catch it with the flashlight, little more than a blur. A sharp searing pain lashed my ribs on my right side. I screamed as I fell towards the ground, only as I was about to hit, something caught me and held me up. I tried to raise the pistol to fire at whatever held me but it was swiftly knocked from my grasp. As it skittered across the floor, I caught a clear glimpse of it; it was long, very long, maybe nearing nine feet in length on all fours, excluding the tail. It’s fur jet black, each paw tipped in five talons, each about six inches in length and curved like a sickle. It’s ribs were exposed, white bone and sinew shone clearly. Black blood oozed from the openings in its abdomen, and it’s stomach was open as well, organs and entrails nearly dragging along the floor as it moved, entirely silent.

“I can smell the fear you quiver with, and the now soiled garments you wear. Your screams go unheard, your pain unfelt. You are nothing, nor your putrid…what do you call it, family? Oh, I must admit, they were delicious indeed,” I tried to scream with something like fear and rage at those words, but something wrapped around my mouth. It was fuzzy and smelled of rot, like something in advanced stages of decomposition. It was its tail, I realized. It’s strength was something impossible, like rebar strengthened sevenfold. 

Police sirens sounded outside, nearing quickly. I tried to squirm and run, but with every movement it wrapped itself around me tighter and tighter. The lights from the police cars shone through the window and I finally saw it’s…face. It was skinny and long, almost looking stretched like a rubber band. It’s snout rounded off with a cats nose and it’s eyes were nothing but abyss, pure darkness. Tooth after tooth lined it’s mouth like a never-ending maze, all razor sharp. A small red collar hung around its neck, the tag hanging from it made it clear that this was Sebastian, my cat, or what used to be. But from its mouth hung something red. No, not red, something bleeding, something- It was an infants arm, shredded off at the elbow, snagged on a tooth. I glanced towards the bathroom where a trail of red blood dragged across the tile and carpet in the living room. I vomited in my mouth and screamed as loud as I could before gagging. Someone knocked on the door.

“Raymond County Police Department, is anyone home?” 

It whipped its head towards the door and snarled, tightening its grip on me almost to the point of passing out. 

“Oh, yes, we’re fine,” it said with my wife’s voice. “Our child accidentally dialed 911, were all good. Thank you!”

I tried screaming again and it then turned towards me, staring directly into my eyes and started grinning. My blood froze and eyes watered. 

“Ma’am, could you please open the door? We can’t leave until we know it’s safe.” 

It loosened its grip on me as it switched back to its voice when it said, “Then you shall parish as the rest of them have,” and shot out of the door at lightening speed. It blew the door off with little effort and completely obliterated the officer standing behind the door. I tried to get up and move but the pain in my side was too strong. I instantly fell to the floor when suddenly something crashed through the window behind me. I looked up to see the upper torso of an officer sitting against the wall. He was still trying to breathe, staring at where his lower half had been moments ago. He tried crawling away but couldn’t as both of his arms were little more than flaps of skin at his sides. He tried to scream to no avail as he realized at last that as he was trying to move, he was dragging his lungs behind him. Then the other officer screamed, and as I looked to the door, I saw the creature slowly drag a talon down the torso of the officer outside. It split open his rib cage and shoved its snout in, bit down on something and ripped his heart from his chest. It swallowed and turned back towards the door. 

It slowly walked back into the apartment, looking for something. It settled its eyes onto the officer against the wall, now dead. 

“Hm, killing it was a shame. The hearts are much more desirable when the host is still living.” It turned its gaze towards me, and then I knew, I wasn’t making it out alive. 

“What the fuck are you?”

It grinned as it said, “I am the air which you will no longer breathe.” It stalked closer and closer with every word. “I am the blades of grass which will no longer tickle your feet. I am the song the birds will no longer sing. I am the farmer which tends to the herd.” It stopped inches from my face, it’s breath and essence nothing short of unholy. It looked directly into my eyes as it said, “I am the one which you humans call God, and you all were so very wrong to worship me. But you have seen me for who I truly am, human. I think I’ll save this meal for last.” It strolled out of the building towards the house next door. It was instantly there, then blew down the door and charged in. The screaming was the last thing I heard before I lost consciousness. 

I woke up hours later to find sunlight shining through the windows. My phone was still in my pocket, but blood was pooled around my chest where a large gash was placed on my ribs. This all occurred no more than five hours ago now, and I’m barely able to tell you all of this without passing out again. Where are we supposed to go now? Who do we pray to for safety now? I would say “God help us all”, but that would be ironic, wouldn’t it?

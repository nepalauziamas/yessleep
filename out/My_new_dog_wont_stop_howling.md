All my life I’ve really loved dogs. Growing up, my family never had one, but I had plenty of cousins who did, and whenever I’d go over, I’d prefer to hang out with the pooches. 

Now I’m 23, and I’ve just moved into my own place. I figured living in an apartment by myself would get lonely, so I got myself a dog, a small black border collie I could tell would eventually grow up to take care of her owner. I live on the first floor of my apartment complex, so I have access to the front and back car parks as a somewhat yard to let my dog out if it gets too overwhelming inside. 

I’ve had her for a few weeks, and she’s normally a well behaved pup, but recently she’s been whimpering and scratching at the door late at night. I usually try to take her out for a walk before it gets dark, but ever since the weird behaviour started, she refuses to come along. Instead, when I call her name with her leash in her hand, she just sits and stares out the window facing the carpark. 

Since I was a big fan of dogs growing up, I guess I expected I’d know what to do in any situation, but this one stumped me. I’ve started taking her out to the back carpark for a few minutes whenever she starts whimpering, where she’ll run around and eventually usually tire herself out. That was until four nights ago. 

Tonight, when she started whimpering and scratching, I went to let her out, but as soon as we reached the building’s back door she froze. She just sat in front of it, staring out into the dimly lit lot. 

“C’mon, Annie!” I repeated, but she didn’t move a muscle. I went to close the door, but right before I shut it completely, she started growling. It wasn’t like any other growl I’d heard from her before. It was a low, guttural, almost predatory one that sent a chill down my spine. She kept growling at the door, even after I’d pulled it completely shut. I didn’t know what to do, she’s never behaved this way before, and it was creeping me out. She wouldn’t follow me when I tried to take her back inside, and I couldn’t just drag her back into my flat, so I tried the door again. I opened it, and that’s when she started howling. Her howls sounded almost painful, and I knew it wouldn’t be too long before the ruckus would start to wake up my neighbours. I tried to calm her down but to no avail, and sure enough, I soon saw the floor manager come into sight.

“Ma’am, could you please take the dog outside?” He asked through gritted teeth. I forced a smile and nodded before walking her outside. She was still howling, but at least now we were far enough from the building where my neighbours hopefully wouldn’t hate me too much. 

“Alright Annie, please relax.” I sighed; she wasn’t going to stop. That’s when she started to yank against her leash. I gripped it tightly but her little legs moved faster and faster. I looked up towards the direction she was trying to run in, and that’s when I caught a glimpse of it. Beneath the flickering luminescence of one of the lot’s lights, a long, black figure stood. From where I was standing, it almost looked as though it was slanted backwards, as if it were only a shadow with no one in front of it. The light above it continued to flicker, and Annie’s howls grew louder and louder. 

A loud smash stopped Annie’s howling, as the flickering light suddenly burst. Shards of glass scattered across the floor of the lot, and I immediately tried to ran back to the building, but Annie didn’t follow. She sat in the same spot, seemingly frozen again. Above us, more of the lot’s lights started to flicker, then burst. With every flicker, I would catch another glimpse of the figure moving closer and closer as the lights created a runway for it towards us. It only moved in the darkness, and it seemed like it was stopped by the lights, but it’s speed gradually increased as the lights continued to break. I realised my time was running out, and I had to make a choice. I let go of Annie’s leash and ran as fast as I could back to the complex, behind me the sounds of glass smashing continued. I was almost at the door when I heard the most terrifying noise imaginable. I’m not sure whether it was Annie or that creature, but whatever it was, it sounded painful. It sounded like it was being torn limb from limb, with a metallic roar accompanying it. 

I made it to the door of the complex and practically threw myself inside and slammed the door shut behind me. Outside, I heard nothing but silence. I bit my lip and walked back to my apartment, my entire body shaking. I leaned against my door for a few seconds before I heard a knock. From the other side of the door, I heard my neighbour asking me if everything was okay. When I opened the door, she gave me a worried look, and her hands was Annie, who looked shaken up, but seemingly happy to see me. I nodded and thanked her, and she left Annie at my feet before walking off. Annie barked and hugged my leg, but I couldn’t find it within myself to pet her. 

It looked like my dog, it barked like my dog, but it couldn’t have been my dog. Not my Annie. It noticed my fear and sniffed me, and I tensed up, but I didn’t make a noise. It licked my hand then went and laid in Annie’s bed. 

It’s been four days since this all happened, and tonight I’m wearing ear plugs to bed. I don’t want to listen to the howling again tonight, and I especially don’t want to listen to the horrifying noise that comes after it. Some nights, the screams that follow are short, but they never stop sounding painful, and now they’ve started sounding human.

I can't leave my bathroom.

About 30 minutes ago I got out of the shower and dried off, put on my pjs, opened the door and walked out, only to find myself back in my bathroom, staring at the closed door.

I stopped, and tried to rationalise what had just happened to me. I convinced myself that I had simply imagined that I had opened the door and stepped out, so I tried again. I pushed the door handle down, opened it, stepped out, and yet again found myself in my bathroom, standing in front of a closed door.

This has happened every single time I've tried to leave. I keep my phone in the bathroom with me when I'm showering- I live alone so I keep it with me just in case, for safety. The first thing I did was call my parents - my dad didn't pick up, but my mum did. I tried to explain the situation to her, but she couldn't seem to understand how I was trapped in my bathroom if the door could open. She seemed convinced that I must mean that my bathroom door's lock was broken and I was trapped inside. Regardless, she said that she would be over asap. She only lives a 15 minute drive away, so she should be here any moment.

I'm sat leaning against my bath tub, looking out the open bathroom door into my landing. I opened it this time, but didn't try to step out. Everything looks normal. My bedroom door is closed just as I left it, the airing cupboard door closed as well, the stairs leading down to the hallway and the front door, all normal.

The door's shut. I don't have any recollection of how it shut, when it shut- only that it must have happened in the last few seconds after I wrote that last paragraph. I've just reread and reread that paragraph, it's proof that I'm not going crazy and imagining this.

My mum just text me to ask if I'm in the house. I said yes, of course I am, I'm trapped in the bathroom, that's the whole reason that I called you here. This is what she has sent:

Mum: Why aren't you saying anything?

Me: What do you mean

Mum: Are you even in there?

Me: Yes I'm in here! Are you here?

Mum: I'm outside the bathroom door. I've been calling your name

I don't understand. I can't hear anything through the door. I'm going to open it.

I can see my landing, my stairs, my front door, but no mum. I tried to walk out, but it was fruitless. Back staring at the closed bathroom door.

My mum tried the handle of the door from her side, but it won't open. She brought tools to unscrew the lock. She says she's doing it now, but I can't hear anything, and I can't see the handle moving. 

Okay, mum text me to say the lock is taken out, but the door still won't open on her side. She looked through the circular hole in the door where the lock was, but just saw my bathroom. Empty.

There's no hole on my side of the door. The handle and lock are intact.

I have no idea what's happening, or how I can get out. After much convincing my mum that I am in fact in here, she said she is calling someone to possibly knock the door down. I'm worried that once they do that, they will find an empty bathroom, and yet I will still be here, trapped in my bathroom. There's no plug sockets in here, never mind my phone charger. My phone will die at some point, I'm already on 24%. When it runs out, I might lose my only point of contact with the rest of the world.

I don't know what to do.

Mum's left now to get help. I'm sat wondering what I can do. I tried to break the door down myself, I knew it wouldn't work, but I had to try. I remember reading once on Reddit that you shouldn't use your shoulder, you should try to kick the door by the lock because it's the weak point. It didn't work. I'm not sure any part of this door has a weak point now.

The window is small, and I'm not sure if I'd actually be able to fit out of it. 

Scratch that - the window won't open either. There are locks on the windows in my house, you can lock them with a little key, but I never received any when I moved in, so I've never been able to lock them.  It's locked now though.

It's got one of those white plastic cheap blinds covering it. I ended up ripping it down. It's pulled some plaster down with it, but now I can get at the window better. It's straight above the toilet, so I am kneeling on top of the toilet lid, yanking at the window handle. It won't 

Wait, it opened. I didn't notice how dark it was outside. It shouldn't be dark, it's midday.

I looked around, desperately trying to see anyone. No one's around. Everything looks kind ofâ€¦ muted. I can't describe it. Nor can I describe the deep seated feeling of dread and wrongness as I look out into my neighbourhood. My instincts are telling me not to, but I stick my head out to look down to where I could possibly drop to.

My window's closed. I never felt myself move, but my window's closed. Even the fucking plastic blind is back in place. 

I'm sat on the floor now, as far away from the window and door as I can get. I feel sick.

Mum came back, along with her work friend. He helped her unscrew the hinges and remove the door. I'm not in there. They can't see me. My mum sent a photo of her inside the bathroom, with no me. She thinks this has all been a joke, and is refusing to reply to my texts or answer my calls. I'm on 14% battery, I don't know if I will ever get to leave. This might be my only chance to say goodbye to my mum, but she won't answer her phone.

Edit: I've ripped down the shower curtain, and yet I'm staring at it right now, hung up, hanging over the side of my bath.

I looked out the window again. I think I heard a rumbling. Low, quiet rumbling. I haven't opened the window since.

My phone's on 1%. If I get out, I will update this post. If no edit comes, assume I'm still here.

I stumbled backward as Andrea stood up as well, placing a hand on her doll daughter’s cheek and then leaning over to kiss it. 

Andrea picked her up, carrying the doll back to the room and closing the door, turning to me with eyes that seemed to show pity. 

“I know all of this is very confusing to you,” she admitted as we walked back to the den. 

“I don’t know what I just saw. And I don’t want to know. Tell me where Macie is. That’s all I care about.”

Andrea gave her husband a look. Both of them looked sad. 

“We don’t know,” he admitted softly. 

Suddenly I was shaking again. My world was shattering. I sat back down because I felt like I couldn’t stand. 

“What?” I couldn’t even hear my own voice. It didn’t sound like me. 

“I’m sorry… the reason that we called you here is that we wanted to offer our help. I didn’t finish explaining myself about Rose…” Bill paused as his wife sat down and she now decided to be the speaker. 

“When she did what did to me, I think it changed her. And not for the better. She wasn’t the same person. She became more violent, lashing out toward others. And she became obsessed with the power she held, always wanting more. She was even able to possess other people, including her roommate,” Andrea explained. 

“I met Sarah earlier today… or rather a version of her. She transformed into a doll the same way you do,” I said softly. 

“She was in love with Sarah but Sarah rejected her. So Rose killed her, to make sure her lover was with her forever,” Andrea explained. 

“So that must mean Rose is alive,” I realized. 

“Well she kinda has to be for the spell to remain working,” Andrea said with a nod. 

I suddenly realized that it must have been Rose that had dragged Sarah away so quickly… which of course led to the inevitable next question. 

“Then where the fuck is she? The landlords said she disappeared months ago.”

“I keep asking myself that. Rattling around in my brain the last conversation we had. It was about the spell. I remember asking her a question that bothered her,” Bill whispered. 

“Like what?”

He snapped his fingers together. 
“I remember asking her if it was normal for the dolls to move on their own.”

A shiver ran down my spine as I looked toward Andrea. She sat there so pleasantly it was hard to believe she had been lifeless only a few moments ago. 

“And that bothered her?” I repeated. 

“She said she would check her spell book and try to figure it out and get back with me,” Bill explained. 

“And that was the last time you saw her,” I realized. 

“I think so,” he said with a nod. Andrea squeezed his hand. It felt like he was being coached to provide these answers. I wasn’t sure if I completely believed everything they told me, but what mattered was finding Macie. 

“I think that Rose may be trying to do us harm,” she explained. “I have been feeling… less alive than I used to. Less than even when I was alive. So I think… something has changed and we are in danger.” 

It was strange listening to her sound so concerned. She wasn’t alive, I kept telling myself that. She died months ago. But I kept my cool and focused on the story they were telling me. 

“Why would she do that?” I whispered. 

“I wish I knew. But maybe if we had that spellbook? It could hold an answer or two,” Andrea suggested. 

I tried to recall all of the things Macie and I had hauled off to the dump. I didn’t recall seeing any book like that. 

“I will find it and I will find Rose,” I promised as I moved toward the door. 


I stopped, feeling awkward to just leave. Even though I thought this entire situation was a one way trip to the funny farm I told them both. “Thank you.” 

Bill followed me out to the front door, closing it as Andrea continued to stare at us. Now alone he drew in his breath and gave me a somber look. 

“I know this is a lot to take in,” he admitted. 

“That’s putting it mildly,” I responded. 

“Look… you should probably take this,” he said, reaching toward a nearby garden gnome and showing me there was a spare key to his place. 

“This is the same one Rose used on that fateful night,” he said softly. It was hard to believe such a tiny object held so much significance. 

“I’ll be back before you go to work,” I promised. “I won’t stop until I find it.” 

“Fine. But just remember it’s there in case I am gone… and if you do return…”

He glanced back toward the closed door. 

“Make sure Andrea and Penny don’t try to leave.”

I held back any judgmental words I wanted to tell him and just gave him a nod. Something about his tone told me this wasn’t just their safety he was concerned about. Was he as much a prisoner as they were? Trapped in a fantasy to believe his family was still alive? 

A moment later, I rushed back to my home, immediately rifling through drawers and boxes to see if I had overlooked the book they told me about. 

But as I looked and tossed aside our clothes mixed with Rose’s, I realized that it wasn’t there. 

That left the dumpsters. 

I rushed outside, looking toward the closest one. As much as I hated to be dumpster diving, I knew that it was my only option if I could possibly help Macie. 

I went to the first dumpster, pushing the cover out and staring down at the trash. It was truly impossible to be sure that the book wasn’t there. I couldn’t even recall which dumpsters that Macie and I had gone to. But there were three more nearby. 

I walked over to the next one, noticing that the landlord was out walking their dog. The large Irish Red Setter looked toward me, barking excitedly as it tugged on its leash and I awkwardly stood by the dumpster. I was sure I probably looked like a crazy person. 

“Is everything all right?” the landlord asked, walking over. The Irish setter sniffed at me excitedly, barking and wagging its tail. 

“Sorry, I think I tossed something out while we were moving in and I’m trying to find it,” I explained. 

The landlord checked his watch. 

“Well you might want to hurry, lass, the trucks come in about ten minutes,” he commented. 

I tensed up, realizing that it was likely if the trucks came before I found it the book would be gone forever. 

“Is there anything I can do to help?” the landlord wondered. 

I gave him a strained smile and told him no. The last thing I wanted to do would be involve someone else in this madness. 

He nodded and tugged his dog down the lane, glancing back at me curiously as I reached the next dumpster. This one clearly had items from the duplex, so despite the fact that I knew he was watching I climbed in and started to rifle through the garbage. 

I heard the truck as it pulled into the parking lot. Suddenly I was scrambling and tossing stuff left and right. Out of the dumpster. It wasn’t here. 

I only had one dumpster left. Climbing out, I ran over to it, the landlord just blankly watching as I did. I was sure he was likely going to call the authorities on me from how insane I looked. But I didn’t care. I had to find that book. 

Slamming the cover open on the last dumpster, I saw a large rolled up carpet mixed around a bunch of other stuff and started to unfurl it, thinking maybe the book had somehow gotten wedged inside. 

Instead I found myself face to face again with Sarah. The doll’s lifeless eyes stared up at me as I looked down at her body. I had been right, there was no blood on her. 
Pulling the doll up, I tried to shove her aside; not even bothering to worry about it right now. What matters is the book. It had to be here!!

I heard the dump truck making noise as it lifted the first large container and I started to dig, trying to see anything that looked like it might be the spell book. 

As I pushed Sarah out of the way more of the garbage though, it began to sprinkle rain. Just more bad luck I needed. 

As droplets of water fell on Sarah, the unexpected happened.  

Suddenly she was gasping for breath like she was going to suffocate. Her facial features turned to normal and her eyes frantically searched the dumpster, completely shocked by where she was at. 

“What the fuck is happening?? Where is Rose! Oh god. I can’t feel my body. What the fuck did you do to me!!” she screamed. I watched as blood stained her clothes and she started to gasp for air, but the rest of her body remained stuck in doll form. An incomplete transformation. 

The dump truck was almost on top of us as she begged “Help me!! Help me please!!” 

Instinctively I tugged at her right arm, trying to pull her up out of the dumpster. But the parts of her that were still a doll were too heavy. 

Her eyes were fluttering as she stared up into the sky, rambling about the past. 

“Rose, are you okay Rose? You look hurt. Oh god what happened. What the fuck happened.” 

“Don’t hurt me,” she whispered as she stared at me. But I could tell she wasn’t talking to me. It was as if she was reliving her final moments when she had actually been a real person. 

“Please don’t. I won’t say anything. Please… please….”

Then I pulled as hard as I could and just like a mannequin doll, her fake arm ripped from its socket. 

I tumbled out of the dumpster onto the ground as the truck arrived. 

The driver gave me a strange look as it started to thunder and then his coworker motioned for them to lift up the garbage. 

“Stop!! Stop!! There’s someone in there!!” I yelled. I watched as Sarah fell out into the trash compactor. The storm prevented them from hearing me as I banged on the door but the machine was already doing it’s work. 

I heard a crushing and grinding noise echoing with her last scream as Sarah was taken apart. The driver stopped it just as it happened, jumping out to look. 

But now, she looked nothing more like a person. Just a discarded and forgotten thing that no one would bat an eye twice about. 

The driver gave me a look, noticing my pale expression and probably concerned that it looked like I would faint. 

“Do you need some help?” he shouted as the rain started to pour down. 

I said nothing, just staring at Sarah and realizing that with her gone the last chance of finding the book was gone as well. 

“It’s too late now,” I whispered. Too late for anything.

&#x200B;

Woke up around 11 this morning. I overslept. Missed a few calls from my Dad… Nobody else, though. So I guess it doesn’t matter that much.

&#x200B;

I had another weird dream about Bianca last night. I don’t know why I keep seeing her… It’s been almost a year, now. I’m over it.

&#x200B;

It was another mall dream this time. Me and Bianca were inside, walking past all the stores. I remember that there were rides and roller coasters in there for some reason too. But they didn’t look like they worked and nobody was lined up to ride them. I think I’ve seen them before in my dreams? It’s honestly a little hard to remember for sure…

&#x200B;

Some of the rides were weird. A lot of them just looked like weird, abandoned roller coasters and some had this sorta 90s neon bowling alley/indoor mini golf course aesthetic. But there were a few standout weird ones, like the one that just advertised pterodactyls eating giant worms (complete with an animatronic sculpture of a pterodactyl with a massive worm wiggling in its mouth hanging from the roof.)

&#x200B;

Bianca took my hand at one point and pulled me into a pet store. The whole look of this store was a hell of a lot different from the abandoned rides we’d passed. It looked like an actual pet store. It was close enough that I almost forgot I was dreaming.

&#x200B;

I remember that her hand felt warm against mine, and she kept looking back and smiling at me as she led me towards the far end of the store. Then she stopped, let go of me, and waited, staring expectantly at a small area fenced in with a thin wire cage. Inside the cage, I could see several fluffy grey kittens roaming around… And naturally, I went to go pet them. I climbed over the cage and knelt down, letting the kittens climb all over me… I remember the feeling of their fur and the sound of their mewls. I remember it all so vividly.

&#x200B;

Bianca stood near the cage and after a while, she handed me some sort of food. It didn’t look like regular cat food. It looked like slices from a brick of cheese. But as dictated by dream logic, I didn’t question any of it. I just let the kittens eat the cheese. Most of them ate it from my hand, swallowing it whole without chewing like snakes. That worked out fine for most of them… But the last one seemed to struggle. Maybe the piece of cheese was too big for it? Either way. I remember looking at it, and knowing that it was choking. I picked it up, feeling around its throat for the cheese. I could feel it bulging against the skin of its neck… So I started to push, forcing it back up out of the kitten's throat.

&#x200B;

The cheese came free… Accompanied by more saliva and bile than I’d expect to have found in a dream… And the kitten seemed to cough before trying to eat the cheese again, this time biting it and taking smaller chunks.

&#x200B;

I turned towards Bianca, wanting to know if she’d seen it! But I was greeted by the sight of her laughing… That laughter. There was something wrong with it. It was cold. Mechanical… I’ve heard Bianca laugh a thousand times. That’s not what she sounds like!

&#x200B;

Her mouth just hung open, not even moving.

&#x200B;

I remember I looked back at the kittens, but they were gone. In their place were these plastic doll heads. Each one smiling vacantly, with long, messy blonde hair and empty blue eyes. I stood up, looking back at Bianca and demanding to know where the kittens had gone. But as I tried to speak, I felt something blocking my throat. My eyes bulged… I clawed at my neck, feeling something beneath the skin.

&#x200B;

It felt like cheese. A brick of cheese, lodged into my throat.

&#x200B;

Bianca just kept laughing as I struggled to gasp for breath. I remember the feeling of my eyes watering, I remember my legs getting weak as I vomited. I remember the feeling of choking on my own vomit…

&#x200B;

And then I woke up.

&#x200B;

Is this the third or the fourth dream where I’ve died? And how many of those had Bianca in them? I’m almost scared to read back and find out for sure.

&#x200B;

Maybe I need to talk to that therapist again… Or I’m going stir crazy. It’s been two months since the magazine fired me. Nobody’s applying to my job applications. I even applied to some fast food places, just to try and have some income. But I haven’t even been getting any interviews. Dad says I need to go out and ‘*pound the pavement*’. He expects me to be handing out physical resumes… I don’t think he realizes that nobody actually takes those anymore. Especially not the jobs in my field.

&#x200B;

Mom says I’ll find something eventually… I hope she’s right. I’m trying not to get discouraged… But it’s difficult. Maybe there’s some symbolism in my dreams? I’ll need to look it up. I don’t know…

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**March 15th, 2022**

&#x200B;

Another mall dream. Why do I always dream about shopping malls? I read somewhere that they represent choices in your life. What choices? My choices these days are: *‘How long are you going to stay in bed’* and *‘What flavor of ramen will you eat today?’* I’m not exactly living in a land of opportunity…

&#x200B;

Last night, I dreamed that I was in the mall alone. There was nobody else there, not at first, anyway. I walked around for a bit, passing by some stores that I can’t remember much about. Eventually, I ended up at a movie theatre.

&#x200B;

I had to take an elevator to get inside and when it opened up, it did so right in the auditorium, in the middle of a movie. I remember looking at the screen and seeing some kids movie. Or, at least I saw characters from a kids movie. What’s the name of those talking dogs? The ones who drive cars… I’m blanking… Anyways. That was what was playing.

&#x200B;

I remember feeling frustrated because I didn’t want to watch it. So I started climbing the stairs, trying to get to the projector. I guess my higher brain knows you can’t actually get to the projector that way, but dream logic dictated that I could. So lo and behold, there was a convenient door leading right into the projector room.

&#x200B;

I remember that the projector was one of those old, almost classical film projectors. Not one of the newer, digital ones. Still, I reached in and started grabbing the tape, as if that would somehow change the movie. Looking at the screen, it seemed to work… The scene changed into something else. Something a little more familiar.

&#x200B;

The character on screen suddenly became a beautiful woman with long dark hair, jade green eyes, and plate armor.

&#x200B;

Lauren Toussaint… God, I haven’t even finished the novel about her yet. But there she was. I stood for a moment, transfixed by the sight of her. I’ve only ever seen her in commissioned fanart before, never actually in a dream… But she was exactly as I’d always envisioned her. Maybe that’s to be expected, since she’s my character, inside my brain…

&#x200B;

On the screen, Lauren marched valiantly into battle, her sword in hand as she fought for the glory of France. She led men onto the battlefield with an unheard of valor, blocking arrows with her shield and cutting down her enemies with her sword. I watched for a few moments, enjoying the sight of my baby on the screen, even if it was all in my head.

&#x200B;

And then I felt the presence behind me. I turned and saw her standing there… Bianca.

&#x200B;

I felt her hands on my shoulders and for a moment, I imagined her lips on mine… I imagined a perfect tableau, where we’d kiss in front of a film based on the book I’d never finished writing. But she didn’t kiss me… No matter how badly I wanted her to.

&#x200B;

No. Her hands cupped my cheeks and she forced me over to the projector. I barely had time to scream before she stuffed my head in between the reels. I don’t know if that would actually kill me in real life or not… But in the dream, I could feel the skin being ripped off my face. I felt my glasses snap before they were torn away. My hair was pulled from my scalp and the last thing I saw on the screen before I woke up was the sight of Lauren lying dead on the battlefield, three arrows in her chest.

&#x200B;

Maybe it’s dumb of me but… Well. I was more frustrated because that wasn’t how she was supposed to die than the fact that she was dead. Either way. I didn’t have a lot of time to dwell on it.

&#x200B;

I woke up. Maybe I’ll work on that novel today… I am feeling a little more motivated, after that dream. It’s not like I’ve got anything better to do. I also noticed some scratches on my face this morning, too. Maybe I did that in my sleep? They don’t hurt or anything. It’s just odd.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**March 16th, 2022**

&#x200B;

I feel like I completely wasted yesterday… I was going to write. But when I opened the document and read through the last chapter, I just blanked on how I’d continue it… Ugh…

&#x200B;

Bianca was always good at helping me with this. She just seemed to always know exactly what to say and how to say it. Christ, she was probably a better writer than me. I went to bed early yesterday.

&#x200B;

Surprise, surprise. I had another mall dream.

&#x200B;

I was hoping that maybe starting this dream journal would give me some good ideas for my writing, but half of my dreams just take place in a mall lately! Well. This one technically didn’t take place in the mall. It took place just outside a mall. Big difference.

&#x200B;

I remember that I was in my car, and there was this woman beside me with long, dirty blonde hair and a gaming headset with cat ears on it. I recognized her as Kat Brooke. She’s a YouTuber I like. She mostly does some video game content. It’s kinda relaxing to have her videos on in the background. She’s got a sorta calming voice, she isn’t too loud and doesn’t act too obnoxiously.

&#x200B;

You know how sometimes in dreams, you seem to already know what you’re doing? Well. I knew that I was driving Kat to the airport. Now, the airport in question here was just the same mall I’d spent so many dreams inside. We drove alongside it, at one point turning down a tunnel that for some reason led through the mall.

&#x200B;

She was staring out the window the whole time, only occasionally talking to me but I don’t remember what she was saying. It didn’t seem that important at the time. What I do remember is that at one point, she asked me to stop and of course I did.

&#x200B;

Kat got out of the car and started walking down the side of the road. I could’ve sworn we’d been inside the mall when we’d stopped… But now, we were back outside. It seemed like we were on a highway overpass of some sort. I could see the mall down below, so we weren’t too far from it at least.

&#x200B;

Kat walked down the highway towards a food truck that was parked nearby, dragging her suitcase behind her. I watched as she went up to the guy inside to order. As I followed her, I could hear her talking but couldn’t hear exactly what was being said. But I could see that Kat was getting more and more frustrated. As I got closer, I think I asked:

*“What’s wrong?”*

&#x200B;

Kat just looked at me, her eyes burning with rage. But her face was different… Her features were different. Her nose was longer. Her eyes were green. Her hair was now straighter and black as midnight. Her gaming headset was gone.

&#x200B;

With just a turn of her head, she’d become Bianca. Her angry snarl turned into a twisted grin and on instinct, I started to run. But Bianca caught up with me.

&#x200B;

I felt something going into my back. A white hot, heavy pain that overwhelmed all of my senses. I felt it in my legs too.

&#x200B;

I remember collapsing and hitting the asphalt hard. I remembered the way it burned against my skin. Slowly, I rolled onto my back and looked up to see Bianca standing over me, a cardboard box full of french fries in her hand. She popped one into her mouth, still grinning from ear to ear.

*“Why are you doing this?”* I remember asking her through tears of pain and terror.

*“Because you belong to Him.”* Was her reply.

&#x200B;

Then, she took one of the fries from the box and drove it like a dagger into my chest. I screamed in pain, but my shrieks of agony were drowned out by her laughter as she straddled me and drove more and more fries into my chest like pins. Each one burned like a knife. Each one made it harder to breathe. I remember the taste of blood in my mouth…

&#x200B;

As my vision faded, I could see something looming over Bianca, far behind her. A tree of some sort… No… No, something else. Something alive. But I don’t really remember what it was. My vision faded to black as I died.

&#x200B;

And then I woke up.

&#x200B;

Something isn’t right…

&#x200B;

I found marks on my chest this morning. Little pinpricks of blood. Maybe they’re bedbug bites? They kinda look like bedbug bites. But on my chest? And after that dream I had…

&#x200B;

I’ve stripped my bed and looked for signs of an infestation. I haven’t seen anything. Maybe I’ll sleep on the couch tomorrow night and see what happens. It was just a dream. Maybe I got bit in my sleep and incorporated that into my dream somehow. I don’t know. I’m probably just getting all worked up over nothing.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**March 17th, 2022**

&#x200B;

I don’t know what’s going on… But I know that it’s getting worse. I woke up bleeding again today. I was on the floor of my living room, still tangled in my blankets. Worse than that, I was in pain.

I’m starting to get scared.

&#x200B;

I don’t think it’s a coincidence anymore that I’ve been waking up with scratches and marks on my body… But I don’t understand why this is happening or what the hell is going on with me! Last night's dream was the worst yet…

&#x200B;

I was in the mall again, with Bianca. We were walking, side by side. I could hear her talking, but I can only remember bits and pieces of our conversation. I know at one point, I asked:

*“Do you think we could ever go back?”*

&#x200B;

It was a stupid question… The real Bianca never answered me when I asked her a few months ago. She’d just gotten this look on her face. It was almost pained…

She’d said: *“I need you to just focus on you, Sadie. Just focus on getting yourself better.”*

&#x200B;

In my dream though, Bianca’s response was different. She’d smiled at me, then started laughing.

*“Why would I bother?”* She asked, *“All you ever did was drag me down. Your constant misery, your constant neediness… You’ll never be happy. You’ll never do anything. You’ll always just be there, wallowing in your own self pity… That’s what you do, Sadie.”*

&#x200B;

The way she said that… The sheer malice in her voice. It didn’t sound like Bianca.

We were walking past the concession stand of the movie theatre I’d seen before. I watched as Bianca hopped the counter and perused the things behind it. She picked up a bag of popcorn, before sauntering over to a display of what looked like souvenir cups. The ones that usually have the poster of whatever the current big blockbuster is. Only there was no movie poster on these cups… There were just pictures of me and Bianca together.

&#x200B;

She picked one up, and with a smirk, smashed it onto the ground, shattering it like glass.

*“It was all worthless to me, you know.”* She said, *“You were really just an easy fuck… You would’ve taken anyone, wouldn’t you? You’ve got nobody else. You didn’t back then and you don’t now! Chances are, you’ll never have anyone but me in your life.”*

&#x200B;

She laughed and smashed another cup… I think she was expecting me to scream or protest. But all I did was stare at her in disbelief. I felt more aware of my surroundings. Aware of the fact that this place wasn’t entirely real. That the Bianca in front of me wasn’t really Bianca.

*“Who are you?”* I asked.

&#x200B;

She paused. Bianca cocked her head to the side slightly. She smashed another cup before finally hastily knocking them all over and hopping the counter again. She stormed towards me, her smile gone.

*“What did you just say?”*

*“Who are you? Because you aren’t Bianca…”* I replied.

&#x200B;

Dream-Bianca put a hand on my shoulder. I flinched back, afraid of what she might do to me. Her smile returned, faint but there.

*“You don’t know who I am?”* She teased, *“Should I remind you?”*

*“No!”* I stammered, *“Wait, you don’t need to-”*

But she was already coming for me.

&#x200B;

I expected her to hurt me… To kill me again, like she had in every other dream. Instead, I felt her lips violently press against mine.

*“Do you remember this?”* She asked.

&#x200B;

I opened my eyes… The scene around us had changed. We were in the woods now… No sign of the mall around us.

I did remember this.

&#x200B;

I looked past her and saw a picnic blanket laid out nearby. There was a tent pitched in the background and somewhere I could hear the gentle rush of waves. We’d come here several years ago… It was just supposed to be a camping trip between friends. I’d told her I’d never gone before and she’d wanted to take me… I remembered…

&#x200B;

Dream-Bianca lovingly tucked a flower into my hair, just like the real Bianca had done back then. She’d laughed before pulling me close. In the dream, Bianca didn’t speak but I could still hear the words she’d said to me a long time ago:

&#x200B;

*“I just wanted to be with you…”*

That was what she’d said when she’d kissed me for the first time… Before she’d quietly led me to the tent and made love to me. Afterward, we’d sat on the picnic blanket, cuddling close and embracing this new thing between us as we watched the waves gently lap against the shore of the lake. It was all just as I remembered it.

&#x200B;

Dream-Bianca took my hands and led me towards the tent. I followed her, mindlessly caught up in my old memories. When we got inside, she pressed me against the wall, which was unusually hard, and then…

&#x200B;

It felt real. It felt just as real as it had back then. Only this wasn’t the same. Bianca had been gentle with me, she’d whispered sweet nothings in my ear, stopping every so often to make sure I was okay.

&#x200B;

Dream-Bianca didn’t bother with that. She was rough. Violent almost. As good as it felt, it still hurt and for a moment, I wondered if she’d kill me again. But she never did.

&#x200B;

At some point, the surroundings around us changed. She pressed me up against a glass surface that didn’t belong in a tent and I could see the mall through it. I could feel the ground moving beneath us.

We were in an elevator now.

*“Let me show you something…”* Bianca whispered in my ear.

&#x200B;

I heard the elevator doors open and she pulled away from me, letting me see what was outside. I looked.

&#x200B;

There was something massive towering over me. Something so big I couldn’t see all of it at once.

It almost resembled a dead tree in a way… But there was so much about it that wasn’t tree-like… Strips of either rotting flesh or moss hung off its branches. Parts of it twitched like the limbs of a dying insect. And from its branches, I could see shapes hanging off of it. Things that looked like people. I could see them writhing and screaming. Twisting in pain. I could hear them sobbing on the wind… And in the darkness of the shape, I swore I could see eyes watching me. Behind the great tree, I saw serpentine tendrils writhing out of the earth.

&#x200B;

Then I felt something wrap around my neck.

&#x200B;

Looking back, I saw Bianca grinning at me. She pulled me in for one final, violent kiss before she pushed me away.

&#x200B;

As I fell out of the elevator, I found that there was no ground beneath my feet. Only the noose around my neck. I tried to scream but my voice was cut off. My strangled cries joined the agonized screams of the others around me before the noose suddenly snapped and I fell.

&#x200B;

The last thing I heard were those screams, mixed with my own before…

&#x200B;

I hit the ground in my own apartment.

&#x200B;

I was awake… I’d just fallen off the couch. But even though I knew I was awake, I could still hear the screams…

&#x200B;

There are ligature marks around my neck. Something was strangling me last night. Something *hurt* me.

&#x200B;

My body aches. I feel weak, like I’ve just had a lot of blood drawn. Something is very, very wrong with me. I know it’s not bedbugs. It’s not just a coincidence either, having these twisted dreams.

&#x200B;

I need to figure out what’s doing this… Because I don’t know what’s going to happen if… When, it gets worse. I’m scared to find out.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**March 18th, 2022**

&#x200B;

I posted on a few forums yesterday about my condition. I also looked online, but didn’t find a whole heck of a lot. There was one post that talked about sleepwalking, but I really don’t think that’s the case. I guess it’s possible, but the symptoms don’t entirely fit. Maybe I need to sign up for a sleep study. It’s not like it could hurt.

&#x200B;

I tried to go out yesterday, just to be out of the house for a little while. It seemed like a good idea. I thought that maybe the fresh air would help me. I almost called Bianca… But she probably doesn’t want to hear from me right now. What would I even say to her? Even though it’s her face I’m seeing in these dreams, I don’t think they have anything to do with her. I’m just seeing the face that would hurt me the most.

&#x200B;

Going out, getting some food, and going for a walk did do me some good at least. It took my mind off of things for a little while. I talked to my Dad as well. He’s doing fine.

&#x200B;

When I got back home, I checked the forums hoping that someone would’ve replied to me. A couple of people had. Most of them didn’t have anything to say. But there was one reply that caught my attention.

&#x200B;

*‘They are already devouring you. You need to get help.’*

&#x200B;

Beneath that comment was a link. I tried to click it… But when I did, I felt something around my neck.

&#x200B;

I felt myself dragged backwards…

&#x200B;

Hanging.

&#x200B;

Screaming…

&#x200B;

Falling…

&#x200B;

I could hear Bianca laughing, and something else, something with a deeper, quieter voice laughing with her.

&#x200B;

When I woke up, it was morning. My laptop was broken by my bed.

I know for a fact that it wasn’t me who broke it.

&#x200B;

The marks around my neck are darker than they were yesterday. I barely had enough strength to get out of bed… It was fear that made me move.

&#x200B;

I’m not going to sleep for a while. I can’t. Because I don’t know how much longer I have until I don’t wake up again. I need to find that forum again. I’m going to look for it someplace public, somewhere, where they’ll wake me up if I fall asleep. I need to know how to stop this. [Because I’m not ready to die yet, and I’m terrified of what might be waiting for me if I do…](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/usqlxq/the_dream_journal_of_sadie_richards_2/)

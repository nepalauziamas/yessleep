What follows is the report of Detective Dunbar of the Yachats Police Department in Oregon regarding the investigation of a series of deaths in Waldport Oregon:

“They say dead men tell no tales. But you can tell a lot by looking into the eyes of a corpse. You can see what they felt in their final moments, what their final emotion was. It’s a little grim but you pick up some things when you’ve been doing this as long as I have.

It started out normal, like any other case. It seemed like a simple homicide at first, a bloated and salty corpse washed up on shore one day and some fishermen contacted the local police. It wasn’t until the coroner took a look that it got weird. The body had turned a sickly shade of blue-gray. This may have been normal if a body had been out at sea for a while but it was determined that the cadaver had been alive mere hours before it was discovered. The cause of death: asphyxiation with a large amount of mercury in the lungs. 

None of this made sense to me or the coroner. All of their faces told me they were in a state of pure bliss when they died but their eyes, god I’ll never forget the eyes. They were locked, in stasis, in terror. Pure fear, don’t know… don’t know how to describe it. 

Anyways sorry, I’m getting side tracked. I mentioned there were multiple bodies. It was about a week later when a fishing boat caught 2 bodies in their net. Same thing, bloated and blue. They had died the night before, mercury in the lungs. This time though I had something I could work with. Their pockets were filled with mollusk shells. But instead of a sea creature in the shell, there were eyes. Some maybe human some land animal or otherwise. 

Then something happened that I’ll never forget. No one believed me at the time but the coroner saw it too. One of the mollusks blinked. It shut its eye and then opened it again. Just once. It was a late night that night and we had both chalked it up to being around the ocean too much, but it was unsettling to say the least. I went home and the coroner locked up for the night.

Needless to say I didn’t get much sleep. Not like it mattered, 5 hours later I got a call from the chief saying there was another body. He didn’t give any detail, just said ‘you gotta see this’. So I drove down to the docks, and I saw something that is hard to put into words. A blue body, naked laying on the beach, with I swear to god hundreds of eyes all over it, staring back at me. Some blinked and the gathering crowd of fishermen reacted to its movements so I knew I wasn’t the only one. Something from the depths, was watching us. 

The coroner refused to operate on this body. Not that I blame him the thing damn well might’ve been alive! I couldn’t get those eyes out of my head. They were calm and analytical, cold. Just watching. The town was quiet the next day and the skies were dark. Seemed biblical yknow. I was glued to my chair in my office looking at all the photos of the bodies and all the information we had. There was nothing connecting them all, they had nothing in common. 

I was sat engulfed by this mystery that I didn’t notice the time, it was 2am. So when I hear footsteps approaching my door over the rain my hand went to the revolver in my drawer. As they got louder I cocked the hammer back and I held my breath. An eternity must have passed before the coroner opened my door. His skin was pale gray when he fell to the floor. The back of his shirt was torn to shreds, and eyes blinked at me as his body convulsed into a mess of flesh and bone. The thing hadn’t moved an inch before I put six bullets into where I thought it’s head might be. I didn’t stop pulling the trigger either, must’ve clicked about a thousand times before someone showed up to investigate the gunshots. 

Wasn’t long before the FBI showed up and took over the case and well, you know the rest. Here we are today. Yknow sometimes I still see them, the eyes I mean. I can’t go to the beach with my kids anymore cause I’m scared whatever that thing was is still watching me. Yeah I mean me when I say that too, those eyes all were staring at me I swear. I’m not too sure we’re out of this yet.”

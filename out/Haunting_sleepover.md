I lay in bed in the pitch black darkness trying to fall asleep after a hard week. Home alone for the night, no big deal. Or so I thought. 

All of a sudden, I feel a cold rush of air and something touch my shoulder. I jump slightly and start breathing heavily. I hear a shushing noise and feel a cold hand on my face. When I turned my head, the figure stands there so I grab my phone and turn on the flashlight to see the figure gone, but when I turned the flash to my TV on the TV stand, the TV starts moving and I know damn well I'm not the one touching it. I turn off the flashlight and look at the time, 3 AM. 

**Voice:(whispering) Amelia...**

I jump and drop my phone someplace in the darkness, not knowing where it is. 

**Me: How do you know my name?** 

**Voice: Amelia, it's cold. Come here before I come to YOU!** 

My heart pounds and I hear it in my ears, pounding like a hammer on a wall repeatedly and fast. I'm frozen in fear. I feel my throat close up and I can't speak or make a sound so I sit in bed frozen and not knowing whether to stay where I am or say "fuck it" and make a run for it. Run downstairs to my dad's room, lock the fucking door and barricade it. Sleep in the closet. 

I hear the pitter patter of footsteps come up the stairs to my room and I hear my dog at my door. My little fluffy poodle stays outside my door whimpering, trying to find her way in, but the door's shut and I'm too scared to get out of bed to go let her in my room to sleep with me. 

**Me: Frey Bae? (my dog's name)** 

**Voice: She's not going to save you from me taking the skin off your bones!** 

My dog's whimpering intensifies and my other dog comes upstairs then they both start whimpering while I stay in my bed in the dark and close to tears. 

**Me: Mags, Frey Bae, hold on, okay? Everything's alright.** 

Just when things couldn't get worse, my phone goes off and the flashlight of my phone flashes as it rings then I see the figure. I scream and put my glasses on, see it running at me so I instinctively jumped back and hit my head on the wall. 

Cold, pale hands on my arms, going to my chest. The dead gray eyes glare at me, the lips curve into the creepiest smile ever known to mankind. Yellow, rotten teeth with the foulest breath. I let out a whimper as the figure's hands are on my chest and he scratches me. I feel the blood flow to my brain slow down as the figure starts squeezing my neck then everything goes black. 

When I open my eyes, it's 9 in the morning. I notice blood in my nightgown and when I look at my chest, there's fresh scratches. I look at my shoulder and see a faint scratch. I look around my room and my TV is back in its original place... 

the figure is nowhere to be found or seen, at least for right now...

 Date: September 14th 1914

Here I am, in the trenches, writing for whoever will find this in the blood and mud soaked trenches lining the borders of Germany.

I am the last of my troop, through my years of fighting in war for the Royal Army, I have never seen anything worse than what I have seen this week. I am fighting German forces in Marne. As I hope there are many more out here, but in the area where I am all the humans around me had their anthem beat out of their souls. I don't know what the Germans were doing or how they even did it.

"JOHN! I NEED A 3o6 CLIP NOW! SPRINGFIELDS RUNNIN' DRY!"

"I GOT YOU BLAKE! I GOT 6 READY TO GO FOR YA!" I shouted back at Blake as I tossed the clips to him.

\*BOOM\*

"GOD DAMN IT! GERMANS HAVE GOTTEN TRENCH BETA! OUR SUPPLY LINE HAS BEEN CUT OFF! WERE FUCKED!" Screeched Blake as he slid back his bolt and peaked out of the trench.

"I ONLY GOT 13 ROUNDS LEFT IN MY SIDE ARM! WE DON'T HAVE AMMO FOR THE GEWEHR 98 EITHER! CONNY RAISE THE WHITE FLAG! ISRAEL DEPLOY THE SURRENDER FLARE VIA THE FELDHAUBITZE! DO IT QUICK THEIR ADVANCING!" I shouted as I gripped my rifle and slid the bolt back.

"RAISING FLAG! THEIR FIRE ISN'T STOPPING, ISRAEL WHAT'S THE HOLD UP CHAP!?" Yelled Conny as he pushes his helmet down, attempting to dodge the bullets racing towards him.

\*BANG\*

"GOD DAMN IT! CONNYS DEAD! ISRAEL WHAT THE FUCK GET THE MORTAR READY!" I screamed as I shot randomly over the trench.

"ARTILERY READY! FIRING NOW!" Israel yelled as he slid the bolt back on the Feldhaubitze and fired it off.

"WAFFEN RUNTER HÄNDE HOCH! WIR WERDEN EUCH TÖTEN!" Yelled a German commanded as he pointed his rifle at my back.

"Okay okay! Wir geben auf!" I yelled as I dropped my rifle and threw my sidearm on the dirt. "Israel lass es fallen! Drop your weapon!" I yelled at Israel.

"Lasst den Großmann los, lasst uns raus!" Yelled the German commander as he grabbed our rifles and weapons and jumped out of our trench.

"Kopieren Sie Kamerad!" Yelled a German soldier as he tied us up and jumped out of the trench.

"Pst! Israel! Do you have your combat knife?" I whispered.

"Negative, it's stuck in the Feldhaubitze from when I was trying to unjam it." Sighed Israel.

"Damn it, what do you think they're gonna do with us anyways? They don't keep prisoners and were not high ranking either." I said as I slumped down onto the dirt.

"I don't know comrade, but we'll see soon." Israel said.

"Hier drüben!" Yelled a German soldier as he rolled a cloaked and protected cart over to the trench.

"Auslösefreigabe für 30 Sekunden!" Yelled the commander as they ran back to their trench.

"What are they doing!? Release what in 30 seconds!?" I yelled, frightened yet intrigued to what it could be.

\*Creeeeeeek\*

I heard the door slide open as I saw a 10 foot tall figure step through the frame. It screamed in a demonic and distorted tone as it ran towards me.

"WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT!?" Yelled Israel as he desperately tried to stand up and run.

"The Großmann." I said as I looked up at the giant figure charging us. "AGH DAMN IT!" I screeched as the Großmann plunged its long and sharp claw-like finger into my rib cage. As soon as the claw pierced the ropes I reached for my 22 lr pistol that I kept on me for special operations, I grabbed it and shot it into the eye like dent in the creature's face.

\*BANG BANG\*

The creature made a screeching noise as it dropped me.

"Israel!" I yelled as the creature turned its head to Israel.

"GO TO THE BUNKER! QUICK-" Yelled Israel before his head was bitten off, in a clean, swift motion.

The creature turned and looked at me and started running at me.

"God damn it god damn it!" I yelled as I stumbled towards the bunker, roughly 50 meters from me.

I stumbled inside and slammed the door. I grabbed the stash of Grenades and waited for the creature to breach the door. But it didn't, I heard a scream of anger and footsteps as it ran down the trench.

"God almighty, lord and savior, please give me strength and power to defeat this devilish abomination from the depth of hell." I prayed as I wrapped a bandage around my wound.

"Scheiße! Scheiße! Scheiße!" I heard a multitude of Germans yelling, as I heard the war cry of the Großmann. I peaked out the slit in the wall just to see dozens of Germans being impaled by the Großmann as it cried its horrible war cry.

I grabbed a Grenade and ran over to the Feldhaubitze and threw it through the slot in front of it. The creature turned its head and ran towards the noise, I slid back the bolt on the Feldhaubitze and loaded a round in. As soon as it ran in front I pulled the trigger and watched as the creature was impaled by the round. It made an awful cry as it collapsed. I opened the door only to see nothing but bodies.

I'm afraid that I can not make it longer, I have burned the body, but I do not have the soul to eat anything, I am going to kill myself, I cannot live with the image of that, demon in my head. This is my final entry. Long live the queen, and please, please end whatever species that thing belongs to. Goodbye.

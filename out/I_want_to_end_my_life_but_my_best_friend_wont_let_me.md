One of the most haunting feelings you will experience is loneliness, it creeps in out of nowhere when you've isolated yourself from the world, and than stays with you until you make contact with another human being. Sadly, when your human you crave companions, and there's really nothing you can do about it except to make people hear you. I've been lonely for too long and now I need to speak to someone. Maybe it will save my life. 

A year ago I had a decent amount of friends and a fairly normal social life, I even had a girlfriend. Now I sit in my room all day because he's watching me.

When I first met him he seemed normal enough, I was walking down my street at night after a long shift at work, and came across him just sitting on the street. I almost didn't see him at first but when I did I noticed that He was crying and I stopped to talk to him, as any empathetic human would.

He told me he was lonely and that he just needed some human contact, so even though I was tired I sat with him and talked and by the time I was ready to leave an hour later he was smiling. We made plans to meet for coffee some time later and that was that.

Over the next few weeks our friendship grew, and we spent a lot of time together. However he was very insistent that I introduce him to my friends. I don't know why I didn't do it for so long. It may have just been that I was busy or I may have unconsciously known that there was something wrong. However I said I would do it soon. 

On the day that I planned to introduce him to my friends I was hit with a realization. Something I found quite chilling. I was thinking about how best to introduce him so that he wouldn't feel uncomfortable and while playing out the situation in my head, I realized that I didn't know his name.

I had spent days getting to know this guy and he was slowly but surely becoming my best friend, yet I didn't know his name. I was really dissapointed with myself and  I had to make it right.

So when I met him on the side of my street, before we made our way to where my friends were gathering, I offered a sweeping apology. I showed how sorry I was that I didn't know his name and wanted to make it up to him anyway he saw fit. He accepted the apology, however went completely blank when I asked him what his name was. 

What I didn't know at the time, was that the world's greatest predators all had something in common. They were able to disguise themselves, so much so that the prey never saw them coming and as the prey, he would never allow me to know what kind of predator he was.

He snapped at me, saying his name was none of my business, and that he really needed to meet my friends. He was hungry and we should go to meet them so he could eat.

This was too strange for me, so I left and went home.

However he never left me alone after that. He was always outside, always inside, always in the rooms I wasn't. He was always somewhere and as soon as I saw him, he would disappear. He was a predator and he was stalking me. However his ability to move quickly was almost supernatural.

I never had a moment of peace, I watched my back constantly and always lived in fear. I never did introduce him to my friends because I knew there was a reason he wasn't attacking me, he was waiting for a bigger meal. 

Unfortunately, being the perfect predator meant that I could never learn what he truly was. He was so good at not being seen that there was no information on him anywhere. 

I lived my life in fear for about a year, isolated from the world, because i was scared that if I saw someone or spoke to someone, they would become his prey. I had everything delivered to me and left the money on the porch, waited for the delivery man to leave and only than did I go outside. Even though I tried to end my life on many occasions, I always found that the objects I planned to use mysteriously gone.

Unfortunately, you can't live alone forever, because your humanity craves the attention of other people. 

So lately I've been thinking that if I don't know the person he's going to kill, if I never meet them, maybe I won't feel guilty. After all he is a predator and it's his job to eat the prey. Thats the circle of life.

So I'm conducting an experiment, to see whether he will be able to find a victim, if I just communicate with them online.

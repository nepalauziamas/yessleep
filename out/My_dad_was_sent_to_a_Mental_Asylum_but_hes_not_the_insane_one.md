My dad wasn't always "crazy." He used to be a loving guy who cared for those around him. Up until I turned twelve, he had always been super upbeat and never skeptical, but that soon changed about six months after I turned twelve. It started with him becoming grouchier and grouchier. He went from smothering my mother and I in his love to shutting himself in his room for progressively longer. Whenever I asked my mom about it, she'd just brush it off. After that, he began trusting nobody. He ate very little in fear that somebody or something would poison him. A couple weeks ago, he started telling me stories.

"Diana, stay away from your mother!! She is not who you think she is!!" He would coo. Of course, I didn't believe him. The day I realized something was off, I admitted him to a mental institution, something that I will forever regret.

"I have a story I'd like to tell you, Diana." He exhaled, calmer than usual. I nodded, signaling for him to continue on. "There once was a young man, about seventeen years old. He was kind and caring, compassionate and determined, very well mannered, but very gullible. He was walking through the forest one day when he heard pained cries. He went to investigate, wanting to make sure the person or thing was safe. He eventually found the source of the high-pitched wails: a young girl. She seemed about the same age, so he comforted her. Shortly after, they became good friends, and eventually started dating." He paused for a moment.

"That sounds like a wonderful story! They lived happily ever after, correct?" I beamed. To my dismay, he sighed.

"I'm afraid that's not the case. Soon after they started dating, she insisted on getting married. The young man thought they were just so deeply in love, but he'd never been more wrong in his entire life. Soon after they got married, she started becoming very hurtful to say the least. They finally had a daughter after only a year of marriage. He thought they'd just be happy forever. One night, he heard high-pitched wails. He looked beside him, and to his utter disappointment, his wife was no longer in bed with him. He jumped up from bed, eager to find his wife and ensure her safety. He ran over to the window and peered out. What he saw scarred him for the rest of his life. Standing right in front of him was a sickly pale figure with the white-blonde hair and pale blue eyes of his wife. Her eye-sockets were deepened, her cheekbones were practically sticking out, she looked like a corpse. Before he could let out a scream, he collapsed to the ground. The next day, he woke up at about noon, and felt uneasy. He felt as if he would never be safe again, so he locked himself away from his family, and became skeptical of everything." he stopped. He stared at me so intensely.

"Dad, that's a pretty dark story. Where did you find it?" I inquire.

"That boy, he was me, and the girl was your mother," he murmured.

"Dad, come on! I thought you were over that!! This is the last straw, you're going to an asylum, where you belong!!!!" I shouted. His eyes widened.

"No, Diana, please, you have to listen to me!! Your mother is not a human; she feeds off of other's despair and demise!!" He cried. It was too late; the text had already been sent.

After he got admitted into the asylum, I had this feeling that I couldn't shake, as if I'd done something wrong. I thought we'd be safe, my mom and I, but it turns out, she was the only safe one.

As I flail around in my bed, trying to get an ounce of sleep, I hear a sudden noise. This is not a normal noise, it's a noise a human isn't capable of making. As my door starts to creak open, the high-pitched, earsplitting wail gets louder.

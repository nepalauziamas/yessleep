I like to think that I'm an avid outdoorsman, but the truth is far from that. I do love the outdoors and  try to be outside whenever I can, but I'm terrible at it, if that's even a thing.

On the occasions that I plan out a trip, something always goes wrong. Having 3 boys makes this even more of a challenge and it doesn't help that my wife hates the outdoors.

No matter the activity, something will inevitably ruin the trip or I'll forget an item we need and be left to do without. One time we went camping and I used a tent that had been in the closet for a year. When we got to our campsite and I opened the tent, it was totally infested  with some kind of mite and my wife refused to sleep in it.

With that in mind, you'd think I would know better than to plan a long camping trip to a national park during the middle of summer. The kids couldn't care less and the wife only feigned general excitement to spare my feelings. We ended up  going to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park and stayed at a back country site for a week. I made sure to check and recheck every  piece of gear as well as pack plenty of snacks for the boys.

To my surprise, the trip went great. Better than great, actually. The boys (4, 6, and 9) had a fantastic time and wouldn't stop talking about how great a time they had hiking the trails and just generally how they couldn't wait to go back again. My wife even told me that she wanted to pick out her own sleeping bag and personalize some of the other gear for herself.

I can't begin to tell you the feeling that I had at all of this. I was ecstatic. Finally something had gone right for me when it came to trying to spend time outdoors with my family. I guess you could say I felt like a hero in my own eyes, as silly as that sounds.

The feeling didn't last for very long.

A few days after we came back home, my 9 year old, Charlie, started complaining about a headache. This wasn't really a big deal at the time and I wrote it off as him being dehydrated. During the trip, our family had covered a lot of ground and like most people, we just didn't drink enough water to keep up with the demand.

He didn't seem to be in the mood for dinner, so we gave him something for the headache and gave him a damp wash cloth to lay over his head while he slept. I tucked the other boys into bed and my wife and I called it a night ourselves.

The next morning, I woke up to my wife frantically shaking me and saying something very fast. It took me a moment to clear the fog from my head as I hear her say, "Charlie won't wake up!"

One leg half-asleep, I did my best to chase after my wife as she vaulted back up the stairs to Charlie's room. When I got there, I realized what she had meant and how terribly wrong she was. Charlie was awake, but he wasn't moving. His skin was moist and his eyes were open, but they were so hollow. He just stared at the ceiling as we shouted for him to respond. His eye sockets were sunken deeply and there just didn't seem to be any life there.

When the ambulance arrived to the hospital, the doctor began asking a volley of questions to my wife and I, but so much of it is a blur. I remember him asking if Charlie had come into contact with any type of household cleaners or something similar. I was terrified by what was happening and I answered the doctor's questions the best that I could.

Charlie was taken away for a bunch of tests and scans, you name it. Many hours went by with a few updates scattered throughout. Mainly it was the doctor telling us the things they hadn't found on the test results and how they'd be checking something else. This went on throughout the night and into the next morning.

Around 9am, we were finally given the news by a different doctor than the one that had been treating Charlie. He said that a nurse had been giving Charlie an IV when she noticed a small tick latched on his elbow. He said that within an hour of pulling the tick off, Charlie's color had come back and he was starting to focus on things in the room. By the time we got to see him, Charlie was able to have a full conversation with us.

The doctor sent off some blood work, but was almost certain that it was the tick that had caused Charlie's episode. He wanted to keep him until the next morning just to make sure everything was okay. When the results came back clean, he cleared us to go home. I texted my neighbor that had been watching our boys and let her know we'd be on our way.

When we got home, everyone was beat. My wife and I were exhausted and Charlie just wanted to rest. He complained about being hungry, but that nothing sounded appetizing to him. Regardless of what we offered him, he refused to eat anything. We did our best not to worry and chalked it up to the stress of what he had just been through. We all called it an early night and did our best to get some sleep.

I slept terribly the first few hours. All I could think about was Charlie and how much his little body had been through the past couple days. Like any parent, the more I thought about him, the more irrational my fears became and I decided I had to go peek in on him to make sure everything was okay.

I never made it to his room.

As I made my way down the hallway to the kitchen, I noticed a dim light that usually on at this time of night. It was coming from the refrigerator. I got a little closer and realized that the door was cracked open a little and the light was coming from inside the fridge.

When I reached out to grab the handle, I felt an awful burning sensation on my hand and I jerked it away from the door. As I did this, the door swung open to flood the rest of the kitchen in its light. There, just beyond the threshold of darkness behind the door, I could make out his small silhouette. As the door slowly continued open, the light revealed Charlie's face, as pale as it had been in the hospital.

There was something different though. Something else.

At first I thought he was smiling, but the more I focused on his dim face, the more I realized that there was something in his mouth. Instinctively, I took a step closer to him and could see he also had something in his hands. My stomach sank to the floor.

In his hands was an empty tray with red liquid oozing out onto Charlie's fingers. In his mouth was what looked like an entire pound of ground beef that had been meant for dinner the next night. The sickening slap of his lips smacking against each other sent the contents of my stomach onto the floor. I realized immediately that Charlie had bitten my hand when I reached for the door. When I looked at my hand, I could see remnants of the ground meat mixed with my own torn flesh.

His voice boomed like thunder, "It's so hungry, Daddy!"

With this, he covered the distance between us in a flash and began clawing and biting at me. I slipped during the struggle and found him quickly on top of me, the look of pain in his eyes. It was as if he didn't want to do it, like something was making him. I shoved back at him with everything I had, his young body sliding far across the tile floor.

I jumped to my feet and readied myself for the next assault, but it never came. My hand was throbbing in pain and I could feel my heart marching away in my throat. I backed myself into the corner of the counter and waited. I forced myself to shuffle back to the hallway, keeping the wall at my back and my eyes out into the house.

Somewhere further in the house, I heard the blood curdling scream of one of my other children. I shot from the kitchen as fast as I could and made a mad dash for the shared bedroom of my two youngest boys. When I got there, the boys were huddled onto one bed, almost crawling backwards up the wall trying to escape from what I knew was Charlie.

The moment his eyes locked with mine, my 4 year old leapt from his bed to make his way to me. As soon as his foot touched the ground, a hand reached out from under the bed and grabbed his foot. In the same bound as he had made to the floor, he was pulled into the darkness under the bed.

There was so much screaming.

As I went in under the bed after my son, I noticed that the light to the room had been turned on. His horrified face peered at me as I grabbed him by his arms and began to backpedal my way out from under the bed. My wife's voice came from behind, "Oh my God, Charlie, what's wrong?!"

I turned to warn her, but it was too late. She had knelt down to embrace Charlie as he ran from under the bed. By the time I saw her face, there was only a portion of it still recognizable. She stayed put in what I can only assume was shock. She screamed into the room, seemingly at nothing. The entire right side of her face was mangled.

I saw the flash of Charlie's pajamas in the dark hallway as I pulled my wife into the room and slammed the door shut and locked it. I don't know how I did it, but I managed to calm my boys while also using my shirt to help stop the bleeding to her face. Somewhere in this time, I heard our home security siren begin to wail. We never moved, we just waited. We waited and I held them all in my arms on their bed until the police arrived.

The police cleared the house and their was no sign of Charlie. I gave what statement I could before we left for the hospital.

It's been three weeks since the incident in our home happened. Volunteers have put together search parties and the entire community has pulled together to help us find Charlie. I don't know what happened to Charlie, but I know it wasn't him. That wasn't my son that night. Still, I find myself thinking sometimes that I hope he's never found.

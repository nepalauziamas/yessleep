I was washing the dishes, staring out onto my front yard through the window above the sink—though I can’t remember what had caught my attention—when I heard a knock at the front door. Setting aside the plate I’d been absentmindedly scrubbing, I stepped out of the kitchen and into the foyer, but for some reason hesitated; my hand hovering just before the doorknob. A feeling of vague yet potent trepidation came over me, as abrupt as the knock on the door had been; and I found myself wondering who could be calling at such an hour, as if I'd been pre-occupied with some important task. 

Finally, a flicker of annoyance arose—annoyance at the audacity of the yet-to-be-identified visitor—and I grasped the knob and opened the door, intending to dismiss them. Seeing as how I had never had any casual guests before, I wasn’t expecting to see a familiar face; as only the ever-austere, somewhat curt officials and dignitaries of my town had ever visited me, and only then in the early days of my residence. (I was born elsewhere, and had only come to reside in the quaint, self-isolated town by certain circumstance which aren’t relevant to this tale.)  

But standing on my porch, his figure slightly shrouded by a mist I couldn’t remember seeing through the window, was a formidably tall man. He was dressed conservatively and appropriately, and by that, I mean he wore a long coat of some grey and thickly padded material: conservative compared to the somewhat peculiar uniforms I’d seen among the townsfolk, appropriate for the decidedly fall weather.  

The coat covered his legs, leaving only a pair polished black boots visible. His face was grim, dour as one who had never once held a smile—if such an expression were even possible for him. Clean-shaven and white as ivory, the man’s face reminded me of some grave-warding statue; a marmoreal sentinel to an unearthly and forbidden necropolis. Along his bare scalp ran tracks of scars, which intersected wildly; as if he’d been assaulted by some rabies-addled animal.  

The somewhat discernible aura about him—distinct from the spontaneously accumulated though plainly natural fog—unnerved for me, for it seemed to carry within it a suggestion of bodily harm. I felt that it was a noxious or otherwise inimical emanation of some kind, and that if I were to let the man in, he would fill my house with this malignant vapor. Carefully, so as to not come off as confrontational, I asked him what he wanted; and without a word, he unbuttoned his coat.  

When the flaps parted, I recoiled back into my house, though in my shock I hadn’t grasped the door. I was thus shown the full, horrific extent of ghastliness that had somehow been silently, perfectly enclosed within that thin barrier of fabric.  

From the base of his chest to his navel, there spanned an image, a *scene* of unprecedented depravity, of morphological chaos and abominable anatomy. From out of his abdomen poured a veritable vista of contorted, bent, and broken limbs; seas and mountain ranges of unwholesomely undulant appendages; forms and figures, totally naked and wretched beyond description, grafted onto one another, joined in insane amalgams of agonized flesh. All were pitifully, unsettlingly human.  

“Join the blessed Mass, Add yourself to the congregation.” Exhorted the man, with lips that were, somehow, paler than the flesh around them.  

Bewitched, enthralled, and of course appalled by the depth and scale of the macabre unreality of that scene, I found myself stepping toward the man, hands outstretched to grab ahold of those outwardly flailing digits amidst his stomach. I knew at that moment that I had been waiting for him, had been watching for his arrival from my kitchen window, washing the same plate—the only one I thought I owned—for hours, days, decades; immeasurable, tireless eternities of patient vigilance.  

My hands met those of that outré, abysmal world, and I was quickly though smoothly pulled inward, into that anemic emissary’s abdomen. And though I’d been given a glimpse of the madness, the sheer enormity of it was not fully revealed to me until I plunged headlong into that ultra-dimensional space.  

It was beyond a region or world, it was a system, an extraterrestrial lacuna, wherein throbbed, pulsed, and flexed planetary forms of...of flesh. Spheres of impossibly amalgamated bodies hummed and murmured in communal agony, orbiting one another mindlessly, as if in some twisted choral exultation of their shared torture.  

I stood atop the surface of one such despairing planet, and all around me, amassed about the area were great, multi-form titans; billions and billions of naked beings fused to one another, grafted together by what had to have been sorcerous surgery. The very ground was flesh, bodies piled atop bodies, backs and bellies and faces doomed to be trod underfoot for unthinkable eternities.  

There were no stars, and yet there was an omnipresent light, a widespread illumination which showed, dimly but thoroughly, the dreadful suffering of incalculable souls. A rank, miasmal fetor pervaded the space, clung to every molecule. The air—if there was any atmosphere to speak of—was teeming with this funeral funk, as if the graves of a thousand lost civilizations had opened and vomited forth their moldering dead. I remember it as a noxious, choking stench, but in that moment of grand, unraveling morbidity, I regarded it almost absentmindedly; for there were far worse things to take conscious notice of.  

There seemed to be an infinite number of tortured beings, inextricably bound to one another in states of sub-sentience; aware only of their incomprehensibly excruciating existence. A droning ambience of dread persisted throughout, darkly accompanied and sometimes overwhelmed by the occasional crescendos of those shrieking Mass-worlds. There was not one entity separate from the wholescale wholeness, not a single unbound soul amidst the collective, paroxysmal nudity.  

It was all simply too much. To behold such monstrous, existentially insupportable things, to witness firsthand the stark cosmic pandemonium of this multi-global congregation, my mind just snapped.  

I sensed, dimly and peripherally, my hands begin to claw madly at the space about me; swiping through the death-choked air as if I were enmeshed in an invisible substance. Like a trapped animal I fought to free myself, having been ensnared in a trap—but one unlike any that had ever existed on Earth.  

There was no sign of the darkly clad emissary—who I’d completely forgotten in my nigh psychotic awe of the abysmal realm—but when my efforts to free myself peaked to a senseless frenzy, something pulled me backwards. And, just as seamless as my trip there had been, I was plucked from that intolerably bleak world and deposited into the mundane one.  

I returned to a semblance of sanity sitting on my porch, staring up at that man—who had, mercifully, re-buttoned his otherworldly coat. He stared down at me as passively as if I’d just returned from a brief stroll, and I knew at once that he was, in some capacity, familiar with what I had experienced.  

Affirming my thoughts, he then said, “Soon, you—and your planet—will join the ranks of The Mass, and one day, when time has grown tired of its aimless and futile march forward, we will all revel in immutable, timeless togetherness.”  

Having delivered his apocalypse-promising omen, that Augur of the Mass turned and strode into the mist. And I, like a dreamer waking from a horrible yet cryptically premonitory nightmare, went back into my home and shut the door.  

That was two days ago—and now, seated at my dinner table on what has been an unusually misty day, I can feel the advent of...*something.* A terrible ordeal will soon beset my town—something from which we won’t be able to flee or hide. Of that, I am certain. I have recorded this experience both to act as evidence of my sanity when it begins to deteriorate, and as a record—though small—of my existence, and the town’s.... should neither survive the impending terror....

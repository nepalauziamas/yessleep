It all started a few days ago.

Lately I’ve been playing this video game. It’s a lot like Harvest Moon or Stardew Valley—you farm things, marry an NPC, etc.

My marriage has been stressful lately. It’s fun to escape to a world where marriage is as simple as giving your husband a jar of pickles every day. Where childbirth is a stork flying by in the middle of the night. Where parenting is leaving your children home alone while you go off on adventures.

Yeah, it was fun… until things got weird on Wednesday night.

My real-life husband was already asleep. Snoring soundly away. I was wrapped up in a blanket burrito, laptop open, starting up the game. My little night-time escape.

When the game opened, I found my in-game husband—Bradley—standing in the corner of our bedroom. I made my little sprite walk over to him, and clicked. His dialogue popped up.

But it was weird. It wasn’t one of the preprogrammed sayings I’d seen so many times. Like *I made you breakfast! Oatmeal with honey, for my honey.* or *How did you know I love pickled beets?!.*

It was five little words that I’d never seen before.

**It’s so dark in here**

It didn’t even make sense. In-game, it was 7:00 AM, and there was lots of light in our little pixelated house.

*Must be a glitch,* I thought. I left him in his little corner, walked out of the house, and began harvesting my corn. When I went back in a few minutes later to drop off my harvest, he was standing next to the stove.

**I made you breakfast! Oatmeal with honey, for my honey.**

Back to the good ol’ canned dialogue.

I left the house and walked into town. Sold some stuff, even visited the mine. By the time my character made it back to the house, only ten minutes had gone by. But in-game, that was an entire day. It was dark, and around 11 PM, when I entered the house.

Strangely, Bradley was not in bed.

*Huh,* I thought. *He’s always in bed at 10 PM.* I walked around the darkened little house, searching for him; but all I found were our two digital children, fast asleep in their beds.

I walked out of the house, and around the farm.

It took me a few minutes to find him. He was in the furthest corner of the farm, among the orchard trees. His legs were moving, as if he were trying to walk up the rock cliff that surrounded the farm. But he couldn’t, so he was just walking in place.

I clicked on him.

Again, the dialogue wasn’t the usual canned stuff. Two words popped up, and my heart dropped.

**Help me**

I stared at the computer screen. An Easter egg of some kind, maybe? But when I paused the game and did a quick search, nothing came up. I clicked on him again, and again, but no more dialogue came up.

Somewhat creeped out, I decided to stop playing. I closed the laptop, set it on the nightstand, and pulled the covers over myself. Soon, I fell asleep.

\*\*\*

The next morning, I’d forgotten all about the game. I made my way downstairs, yawning, to find my husband and our two daughters in the kitchen.

“Good morning,” I said, taking a seat at the kitchen table.

He grinned widely at me. Then he walked over, and with a *clink,* set down a steaming bowl of oatmeal.

“What—”

“I made you breakfast!” he said, still grinning. “Oatmeal with honey… for my honey.”

Reddit, you have to help me. Please. I don't know what to do.

Today, my girlfriend Thea decided to go hiking. I know--I should've gone with her. But she always does her hikes alone because I slow her down. Usually she's only gone two hours or so.

Now, she's been gone for nearly four.

I'm considering calling the police. She should've been home by now. I've tried calling her, repeatedly--but she doesn't pick up.

All I have is our text conversation from the day, and as I read it over and over I feel like something is terribly off.

**2:33 PM**

**Me: Seen anything cool yet?**

**Thea: Nope. I'll send you pics when I get to the waterfall tho!!**

**2:57 PM**

**Thea: You're cooking dinner tonight right?**

**Me: Yep! Chicken pot pie**

**Thea: Yum!! So excited!!**

After that interchange, we didn't exchange any texts for about an hour. I wiled away the time constructing pylons in *StarCraft.*

Then, around 4, she sent me a text.

**4:06 PM**

**Thea: I found the waterfall!!**

Below this text was a selfie.

Thea, standing in front of a small waterfall, smiling at the camera. Arms crossed, cap covering her wild hair. Earrings--the turquoise ones I'd given her on our first anniversary--glinting in the light.

I sent a text back.

**Me: You're cute ;)**

Then I stopped.

Something about the photo… bothered me. I stared at her smiling face, blue eyes shaded by her cap. Her thick curls of black hair, brushing her shoulders.

*Wait.*

Her arms were clearly crossed. She wasn't holding the phone--there was no way she could be.

Someone else had taken the photo.

Or maybe she'd propped it up on a rock or in a tree. But she couldn't have taken the photo herself. I quickly shot off another text:

**Me: Who took that photo?**

She didn't reply to that, right away. So I'd left the phone on the desk and went downstairs to start prepping dinner. I pushed the creeping anxiety to the back of my mind and focused on the food, putting more effort than usual into cutting the onions.

Call me paranoid, but my last girlfriend cheated on me and left my heart broken. Knowing someone else took that photo--and the fact that she hadn't responded to that text, when she'd responded to the others promptly--made me feel awful.

*Come on. She probably just asked some passerby to take her photo.*

\*Clunk--\*my knife sliced through the onion, hitting the cutting board with a full thump.

*But what if…?*

When I got back upstairs forty-five minutes later, I was relieved to see there was a new text.

**4:53 PM**

**Thea: thinking of you ;)**

I frowned. First, she didn't answer my question. Second, Thea doesn't usually send emotes or smileys. Gifs, sure, but not this.

It was weird.

**Me: Thinking of you, too. Did you get my last text?**

**Thea: i'll be back by dinner time <3**

Thea usually didn't send less-than-threes to me either. That was more me. In any case, I decided to let it go.

**Me: Ok. I love you. <3**

I unpaused *StarCraft* and played for a while. I was only interrupted by my phone pinging. I picked it up.

A text.

**5:37 PM**

**Thea: i'm on my way back**

**Thea:** ***\[image loading\]***

The image popped up.

It was another selfie. This time, she was holding the phone--I could see her outstretched arm in the lower part of the frame. And she was standing in a much clearer part of the forest--she must've been near the trailhead.

I breathed a sigh of relief and began to type.

**Me: Awesome! Pot pie is already in--**

My fingers froze.

In the photo--just at the edge of the screen--there was something in the fallen leaves.

A shadow.

A shadow, just a few feet from her own, cast by someone off screen.

It's after six now. Dinner is cold. I've been sitting here, my heart pounding, calling Thea repeatedly.

Nothing.

Except for one text that came in, as I was typing this up.

**Thea: i'm going to be home late. sorry. i love you <3**

Somehow… I'm sure she wasn't the one who sent that text.

Jane is my life. She is always there for me no matter what. But she doesn't seem the same anymore. It's like if an imposter did something to my real wife and switched places with her.

This all started 4 days ago. I woke up on Saturday morning. I glanced over to my clock which read 6:00 AM. I quietly got out of bed and went to kiss Jane, but she wasn't there. I was weirded out by this but went downstairs to the smell of bacon and eggs. 
"Good morning, darling." Jane greeted me. I greeted her back, weirded out by how early she woke up, as she always slept in on weekends.
"You're up early. You usually sleep in on weekends, why the change?" I asked. Her eyes went wide for a split second and then they went back to normal,
"Oh, I just felt like waking up early today." I didn't think much of it, and I just ate. She left the house a couple minutes later, not even saying goodbye.

Around noon I checked my messages and found that she hadn't texted me at all. This was also unusual as she always texted me if we weren't together. I sent her a message, "Hey, how come you haven't texted me today?" Almost immediately she replied that she had been busy with something. I wondered if that "something" was related to her weird actions that day.

At night we ate dinner and then watched a movie before  bed. As I layed down I realized that she was breathing heavy and her eyes had a little bit of fear and panic in them as if she had something she wanted to say but couldn't, and eventually we both fell asleep. I had a dream but now I can't remember what it was about. I woke up to the sound of someone talking in the middle of the night. I checked the clock and I read 2:56 AM. I looked to my side and saw that Jane wasn't there. I walked out of the room and looked down to the first floor from the balcony. I saw Jane, and she was talking with someone on the phone, "Do you have her? Make sure she doesn't leave, he can't find out." I went back to bed hoping that I was just having a dream.

The next day was similar apart from a few changes. This day she slept in, just like she used to. And when I had to leave because of a work emergency, she texted me very often. I thought that she was back to normal, and that maybe something in her family happened, but I couldn't have been farther from the truth. I woke up at 2:50 AM to her on a call again. I went to check but went back to bed before she came back up. 

Today was when it all went wrong. I left to work in the morning and Jane texted me as usual. Everything seemed fine until the night. Jane was acting very weird. She barely ate any food, and kept going outside for "breathers" I thought that something happened in her family again but the first night that I woke up and heard her conversation was still in the back of my mind. Who was "She?". We went to bed after a while and I was hoping that whatever was going on would just stop and that I could have MY Jane back, but the worst was yet to come.

 I woke up to a 1 second shrill scream before silence. I jumped out of bed and quietly went to the balcony to see what it was, and in all of its horror, I tried not to scream at the sight of my wife standing with a bloodied knife over another person which looked exactly like my wife. I walked back but I hit the wall causing her to look at me and scream, "What are you doing awake!? You were not supposed to see this!" I froze in terror as I watched  her run up the stairs in full sprint with a knife. As my instincts kicked in I ran to the bathroom and locked the door. This is where I am right now writing this on my phone. She kept repeatedly telling me to go out and talk to her, but now she has stopped and all I hear is scratching and faint banging. I'm terrified. What should I do?

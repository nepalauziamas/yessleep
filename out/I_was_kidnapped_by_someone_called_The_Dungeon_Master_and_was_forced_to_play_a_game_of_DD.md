"Roll for perception", the excited voice called out to me from inside the darkness. 

I was sitting in a hard wooden seat with something cold and solid pressing against my left wrist. In my right hand, I felt a strange small object. It almost felt spherical, apart from the many small edges that were around its outside. 

"Well aren't you going to roll. Throw the dice", the same voice said from within the blackness.

I realised the thing in my hand was a die, and I felt I had no choice but to throw it. I shook it inside my closed fist for a second before releasing it forward into the pitch black unknown.

The die landed on something wooden and then I heard a small click followed by a small beam of light that emerged from a few feet in front of me. The light shone down on the die that I had just rolled, before abruptly disappearing. 

"You passed the perception check. You all passed, and so you are now able to see", the voice said. 

Once he had finished speaking, the room flooded with light, which took my eyes a few seconds to adjust to. Slowly coming into focus though, was a round wooden table that sat in the centre of a cramped room. 

Sitting around the table were three men, two of which looked terrified. The third man, who was wearing a rubber mask that resembled a medieval knight, looked giddy with excitement.

"The lights turn on in a small room, revealing two other adventurer's ready to embark on their journey", the thrilled man said, excitement oozing from his every pore. 

I was unsure of where I was, who these people were, and how I exactly got here. I glanced down and saw the metal handcuff that chained me to the wooden table, and knew that I was here against my will. 

"The adventurer's stare at each other in confusion, unsure of how exactly they got there", the masked man continued, "But, the thing is, they were there. And now they had a mission to complete. There is a BBEG known as the Dungeon Master, and he has been kidnapping innocents and making them play his twisted game. The hero's were meant to stop him, but during their quest, they too were taken by the Master and were now forced to play his game".

"Let me go, you freak", one of the other captured men suddenly called out.

"The Dungeon Master ignores the pleas of the captured and continues on with his dastardly plan", The Dungeon Master replied without stopping to think about what he was going to say. 

"Let us go", the man pleaded again. 

"Well, if you really want to convince me, you will have to roll for persuasion", the Master said before letting out a slight chuckle.

The man stared at him blankly, and so the Dungeon Master moved from his place at the table and walked over to him. He was holding a small die in his hand and he placed it into the captured man's hand. 

"Now roll", the DM said and mockingly mimed  throwing some dice. 

The man, realising he didn't have much of a choice, threw the die across the table. It clacked down onto the wooden surface and bounced a few times before coming to a standstill. 

The DM craned his neck and looked at what the die showed. He smirked when he saw it. 

"A 6. Hmm, I wonder if that will convince the Dungeon Master to let you go?", he said excitedly. 

I am very familiar with the game Dungeons and Dragons, and so I knew what that roll meant. It wasn't good.

"The Dungeon Master hears your pleas for escape but laughs in your face and rejects them", the DM said before turning to laugh directly at the man who had rolled. 

He didn't react to being laughed at, but the man next to him did. He began to sob quietly and his head dropped down in defeat. 

"Oh, why are you crying? Are you not Gerald the Sneaky, the accountant feared by all", the DM said before turning to point at the other captured man.

"And you, Rowan the Agile, the friendly bus driver, admired across the land".

The man in the knight mask then turned to me and exclaimed, "And Matthew the Wise, teacher to the youth".

I was shocked. The Dungeon Master was correct. My name was Matthew and I was a high school teacher. But, how did he know?

As I looked around the table at the others, presumably Gerald and Rowan, it was clear by their surprised faces that he knew their name and occupation too. 

Gerald spoke first.

"How? How the hell do you know who I am?".

"You really think I don't know the members of my own party?", the DM responded. 

Nobody spoke and so the Dungeon Master continued. 

"The look on each adventurer's face is one of shock and confusion, as the Dungeon Master carries on his twisted game. What do the adventurer's do next?", he asked as he looked at each one of us. 

"I break out of these handcuffs and kick your ass", the captive named Rowan called out aggressively.

"Oh, you mean to intimidate the DM, do you? Well, you're gonna have to roll for it", the DM said as he handed Rowan a d20 die.

Rowan, sensing no other option, reluctantly obliged and threw the die. It hit the table and landed on a number.

"Ooooh, a 10. The DM is a little scared by your remarks, but is not so afraid that he lets you leave. What do the other adventurer's do?", the masked man said and faced Gerald and myself. 

I have quite a bit of experience with D&D, and have found that roleplaying, instead of trying your luck rolling dice, is the better way to figure out villains' motivations. So, I thought that it would be the best course of action to play along and find out what exactly was happening here. 

"Tell me, Dungeon Master, what are your true intentions of bringing us here", I asked him, trying my best to sound interested in his game. 

"How dare you question my intentions. They will become apparent soon enough.", he answered.

"But, DM, we were the heroes that were meant to stop you, how is it that you captured us so easily", I asked him, trying to extract any information I could out of him.

"It was simple enough, Matthew the Wise. All I had to do was track your each and every move, and then when the time was right. I could strike".

"Very clever plan. But, what happens once we have finished your warped game?"

"You will see once the game is finished".

"Y'know, normally villains are excited to spell out their evil plots for the heroes. So why aren't you?", I asked him, getting frustrated with the lack of answers.

"It builds suspense".

"I knew someone just like you. He was a part of my school's D&D club, but no one wanted to play with him because he always had secret plans that went against the party. In the end, I had to kick him out of the club. So, I have dealt with people like you before", I told him.

"Enough!", the DM yelled, "I have had enough of you all questioning me. Of you all not playing the game properly".

He then picked up his own die and rolled it on the table. 

"The DM uses a surprise attack against Matthew the Wise, and he rolls a 16, which is more than enough to beat your armour class".

I saw the Dungeon Master quickly whip his hand down and towards my thigh. A sharp burst or pain shot down my leg and I let out a grunt of pain. 

I looked down and saw blood starting to trickle down my leg and, when I looked back at the DM, I saw he was holding a small knife in his hand. A knife he had used to slash open my upper leg.

"Ooh, looks like you received 4 slashing damage", he said before laughing.

It was at that moment that I, and the other two, realised just how twisted this game really was. 

"Now, all roll for initiative. That's right, you get a chance to attack me too".

I saw Gerald and Rowan both reach for their dice and roll them. I knew I would have too as well, but I had to get over the shock of getting sliced open first. 

After a moment, I too picked up the dice and rolled. The DM excitedly looked at what each of us had rolled and then gave us the results.

"Gerald, you first. Then Rowan. Then I attack again. Then Matthew is last."

Gerald picked up his d20 and rolled it onto the wooden table. It landed on an 18.

"Well, well, well. Look at that.", the DM said, "You get to attack me".

"With what?", Gerald spat.

"With whatever weapon you have on you", the DM replied, "Check your pocket".

Gerald quickly used his free hand to search all his pockets, but they all came up empty.

"I don't have anything on me", Gerald said, defeat clearly in his voice.

"Well, thats just too bad. All adventurer's should come prepared", the DM said smugly, "Rowan. You're next".

Rowan lifted his die, hands shaking as he did and rolled. 

"I'm sorry, you only rolled a 3. That doesn't get past my armour class".

Rowan let out a sob, and I felt my own fear rising. It shouldn't have been surprising, but the game was rigged against us. The chances of getting out of here alive were getting slimmer.

"My turn. This time I aim to attack Rowan the Agile.", the DM said and threw his own dice onto the table. 

The tension at the table grew and I felt my own heart beat increase, even though I wasn't the one getting attacked this time. 

The die landed on a 15, which I guessed meant he hit. 

The quick movement of the DM's hand and the blood that spurted out of Rowan's arm answered this. 

Rowan screamed in pain and yelled, "Let us go, you bastard. None of us want to play your fucking game".

"I know.", the Dungeon Master responded, "That's the problem".

He then reached up and pulled the knight mask off of his face, revealing his true self. All three of us gasped when we saw who was underneath it.

Gavin. The young man from the school D&D club that I had to remove from the group. No one wanted to play with him then, and no one certainly did now.

"Gerald. My accountant. You told me about the little D&D party you were in while I was seeing you about my own finances. You told me that the group was full and I couldn't play. And Rowan, you drive the bus I catch everyday. I asked if you wanted to join my campaign, but you turned me down".

Gavin stopped speaking for a moment. He turned to me, his eyes filled with fury.

"And you. You took me away from the only group that allowed me in. I felt like I belonged and you removed me. That, I can't forgive".

He stared at me with a hatred I had never experienced before. I already knew how dire my situation was, but I felt any hope I once had died out. There was no possible way I would be allowed to live. 

"But, what kind of a Dungeon Master would I be if I didn't at least let you roll", he said to me and gestured for me to roll my die once more. 

I picked it up, shaking as I did. I shook the die inside my hand for a moment before releasing them onto the wooden table. 

The die hit the table and bounced once. Then again. It then teetered between two numbers, before falling down onto one of them. 

I had rolled a 17. Enough to hit him.

"Very well, use whatever weapon you have on you to inflict damage on me", he said, knowing full well I wasn't in possession of a weapon. 

He was just about to finish the round and move back to Gerald's turn, when I spoke up. My plan had to work. It was my only hope of survival.

"I choose to use a melee weapon. In particular, my fist", I said not very confidently. 

"Hmm..I guess you are allowed to…shit..didn't think of that as an option.", the DM said, angry that I had just outsmarted him.

He thought for a moment longer before adding, "You must roll for damage first. You will use the d4, and what you roll will determine how hard you can hit me".

He walked over to me and placed a metal d4 in my hand. The d4 is a four sided die, with each point being infamous for how sharp they are. 

Gavin then crouched down, so that his face was next to mine. He was eagerly awaiting the result of my roll. 

I shook the d4 in my hand and was just about to release it when, in one quick movement, I swung it upwards and embedded one of the dangerously sharp edges into Gavin's eye.

He screamed out in agony and almost looked surprised by what I had just done to him. He clutched at his eye, desperately trying to remove the die I had just forced into it.

As he writhed in pain, he fell to the ground and I could see a long streak of blood now running down his face. Once he hit the floor, he continued to try to take the sharp object out his eye.

I heard a slight jangling sound as he hit the ground, and I got a quick glimpse of something shiny and silver. The keys to the handcuffs.

I reached across the table, grabbed the d20 and rolled it one final time.

I rolled a natural 20.

I looked down at the pathetic mess of a person on the floor and stomped on his head two times, knocking him out cold.

"Critical, motherfucker".

It has been a decade since the incident, but the trauma that was inflicted upon us those days still echoes in our lives. It’s because of that, that I’m taking over writing the ‘epilogue’ of our story.

While Olivia remembers most of what happened with Jack in detail, the rest of the year is completely blank. There are times that she will look for her father and forget that he, like mine and Owen’s, has been missing since.

The official police report said we were found in the back of the ice cream truck and were brought to a hospital while unconscious. Their leading theory was that our fathers were in gambling debt and we were taken as collateral, which explains why they disappeared.

There’s not really much to say after that. He kept his promise. Every issue that we had before July 2nd, no matter how small, faded into thin air.

My mother and I moved shortly after the incident, luckily landing in the same building as Owen. She found a good job and quit smoking, which mellowed her out quite a bit. Without dad to stress us out, as bad it may sound, our lives did get better.

Owen, on the other hand, was more devastated over his father than both of us combined. When his brother got out of prison, they combed the entire city together, looking, but never found any leads, dead or alive.

He seems to have forgotten or suppressed the supernatural side of the events and I don’t blame him. He doing better recently, still searching, but he’s getting a degree to help endangered youths and put his and I quote “Bad memories into relatable ones.” Unquote.

Olivia’s life went a little sideways for a few years. She was selectively mute for a good while and did a stint in a mental hospital, but she’s back on track now. She doing therapy while working on her law degree, which is good because I’ll need a lawyer to get me out of the mess I got myself into.

I’ll confess. I knew the police and our moms were lying to us, but I didn’t tell them and I have yet to do so.

I joined the force specifically so I could look into those files and I was right.

They found human remains in buckets, ready to be processed into ice cream. Not only that, but they profiled them as missing adults from 2002, previously linked to a traveling serial killer.

What I’m really interested in, however, is the body they discovered on July 13th 2012. A white male in his twenties with blonde hair and average build. Jack. It was Jack’s human shape and I’m sure of it. He’s dead.

That would be a good thing, I think, if it weren’t for the fact that he’d clearly been bitten in half by something. The left side of his corpse had been chewed and spit out by another creature large enough to have a mouth capable of doing it.

There were signs of a struggle.

Olivia has handed me the card that Jack gave her, with the company’s name on it. Late Night Cravings Inc. I’ve been looking for them, but so far, they have no media presence.

I have a theory that Jack was ‘fired’ by upper management for not sticking to the rules. That he was supposed to be paid first. That we’re only alive because of his mistake.

Even so, I’ll be ready to take them on when the time comes. Whatever this company is, its employees have to meet a gruesome end and I'll make sure of that.

 

Sorry about my english. Im a brazilian guy.

I lived it when i was younger, but still scares me and my dad a lot, We don't know what happened, i was long time ago and my dad didn't looked for it more than the moment when he saw me.

Im from the south of Minas Gerais. My uncle has a spare parts store and he needed to go to São Paulo to buy some stuffs. He didn't know São Paulo good enought, so he asked for my father to go with him, and i went together.. My father used to go to São Paulo, so, you know, it was easier..

Ok, after a long day walking on one of the busiest streets of São Paulo (25 de março), we stopped on a arabic restaurant so i could go to the restroom and eat something (i have 26 now, but that time i had about 8 or 10, i don't know exactly). We entered the restaurant, my dad put me on the restroom and waited me from the outside.

Now is the problem. When i came out of the restroom I was at a complete different place, it was a lobby from a building, old and tall. WTF was going on????? In one moment i was on a restaurant and now... So I went back, shutted the door and tried to get out again, and nothing. Same place, the lobby. I was creepied out. Didnt know what to do. I think i tried to do it about three times, go back to bathroom and try to go out...

(I dont know if it is a trick of my mind, but i remember of a man, a receptionist, he was sitted on a chair.. i tried to talk to him, to tell him about what was going on, but he didnt answered me and i ignore it too...)

So i decided to go to the street and look for the restaurant. I was tempted to across the street (if i had did it, probably i wont be here), but i kept the same sidewalk and turned left, I walked a little more and reached the restaurant. Some datails is a blur in my head.. the moment i went out the bathroom and how i stopped at the restaurant.. I dont know if it take time or was fast..

My father says that i came out on a different hallway and took the wrong side, but the door of the restroom is sided to the hall, my father was looking at it and did saw me. 

I found the restaurant, some pics from inside it, but seems a normal entrace to the restroom.. Nothing complex and hard to access.. I dont know if i was at 7 Além (a brazilian urban legend) or the matrix glitched with me..

Raful is the name of the place, on 25 de Março, a popular place in São Paulo. I looked on google map to find out the building, but nothing comes to my memory.

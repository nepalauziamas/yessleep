[I work for a county Sheriffs office in Maine (Pt.2) - Here’s why my Coworkers suck.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/pv95rk/i_work_for_a_county_sheriffs_office_in_maine_pt2/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

When Eric had told me a ‘demon’ was responsible for the slayings I burst out laughing. It was brought on by a combination of my nerves and my genuine belief that he was joking with me to lighten the mood. The outburst of laughter evaporated as Eric’s flat eyes turned to me, I knew by then that his expression never changed, but I could have sworn he was contemplating killing me or something. There was a silent fury burning there, or maybe nothing at all. Shark eyes, that’s what he had.

After my outburst I coughed awkwardly and settled into silence. Eric continued whatever it was that he was doing, examining the bodies, taking photos and gathering samples, I assumed those were to be used as evidence. We stayed in that clearing for quite some time with the victims. In my head I played out various scenarios of what I thought might have happened. I imagined the group fleeing terrified in the darkness, running blindly through the foliage with low tree branches catching at their clothing and hair.

I thought of one them the morning before, packing up their campsite and heading off on an unmarked trail. Maybe they saw something of interest the lured them that direction. Then realising their danger and running until they met the river, frantically trying to decide which way to run next. One of them must have decided to run downstream, perhaps to deceive whatever pursued them. I imagined them later in darkness holding onto each other desperately trying to stay quiet in their chosen hiding places. But maybe they never even made it to the first night. Maybe all the terror I imagined never happened, perhaps whatever it was that set upon them was so efficient that they never even had time to be afraid at all.

Eventually I called it in over the radio that we had found multiple casualties, Diane assured me that once the mountain was ‘safe’ they would send in rescue workers to recover the bodies.. More time passed, it began to rain. It was only a light misting of water that settled a dampness over clothing and left small droplets forming on leaves. This is when Eric limped back over to me, his cane sank slightly into the damp earth as he leaned on it, “You can go back now if you would prefer.” He stated though it came across as an instruction.

“It’s probably against policy to leave when there’s some man-eating animal around.” I answered glumly.

“Perhaps.” He answered after a moments pause and I noticed for the first time a smile was starting to form on his lips as he continued, “However, you are welcome to leave none the less.”

I felt my blood boil. This a\*s hole was implying that I leave because he thinks I can’t handle this situation. I might be new to the job, but at least I look old enough to shave. I stood and looked him square in his good eye, “I don’t need to run home, if that’s what you’re suggesting.” I told him firmly.

“Very well. Come.” He said simply moving off into the forest.

“It’s against procedure to leave a crime scene unattended.” I called after him utterly peeved at his nonchalant arrogance.

“So stay.” He shrugged, “My job requires that I continue on. You don’t think I was called here simply to give a nod of approval that this a dangerous animal you have here, now do you?”

“What exactly \*is\* your job again?” I retorted.

“To eliminate the threat.” He answered bluntly.

Frustrated I said nothing more and followed after him into the forest. I knew this was against procedure, but he was my leader for the day and out is procedure to follow the orders of a direct leader. Though his orders were vague at best. He was following some distinct trail I couldn’t determine, it was almost like following a native tracker, except they tended to at least explain what they were looking for or following. This man walked sure in his navigation, turning at different points with seemingly no indication as to why. I began to think that he was actually lost and just trying to keep up appearances.

Then I noticed that his damaged eye seemed to be seeing, or looking? If nothing else it was definitely moving independently from his good eye and whichever way it looked in he moved to follow that direction. A chill ran down my spine, that was certainly one of the creepiest things I had ever seen. It’s within all human instinct that things that look human but not, deeply unsettle us and I was beginning to have my doubts about just how ‘human’ this man was. That’s not to say I believe in anything supernatural, more that I believe humanity can leave a person.

After a few hours hiking through the woods and beating up the shrubbery, Eric stopped. He set his cane aside and, to my infinite surprise, began unbandaging his damaged arm, “What on earth are you doing?” I asked dumbfounded.

“My job.” He replied without elaborating.

Under the bandages his arm was an odd purple-black colour, similar to his bad eye. It was bumpy in a weird way and seemed to have what I can only describe as scales on it. His hand was disproportionately large with long claws where his nails should have been. He flexed it casually, opening and closing his hand as if he hadn’t done so in quite some time. I recoiled in horror.

Stumbling backwards I nearly fell over a fallen log, I couldn’t make sense of exactly what I was seeing, had this guy had some serious body modification surgery or something? Was he a monster like that in children stories? I settled on the first option as he grinned over at me, this was the first time I had seen him smile in full, and I immediately noticed why he didn’t smile with teeth normally. The teeth on the right side of his face below his purple eye were all oversized and pointed. His gums were the same discoloured purple as his eye.

“Scared?” He mused

“W-What the- heck did you have done?” I stammered out too in shock to think of anything else to say.

“Why assume I did it by choice?” He asked instead clearly amused, “I told you that you were welcome to remain with the corpses.” Even when he spoke now his voice was still dull, devoid of emotion and that was far more unsettling, “If you’re going to shoot me, aim well. I don’t take kindly to that reaction.” He warned and I realised then that I had unholstered my gun.

I couldn’t remember doing that, but I was gripping it tightly as my thoughts collected themselves in my head, it was starting to make sense. Eric was the one. He had killed those campers. That’s why he knew which way they had run, that’s how he knew to follow the trail that I couldn’t find. He was a serial killer with some horrific body modifications, he probably got off on the fear people had at seeing his appearance. They probably thought a demon had come for them.

I struggled to figure out some way to gain the upper hand in this situation. He had all the advantages, he had lead me further out into the woods for hours, it was going to be dark soon and I didn’t carry as many rounds on me as I should have. I work in a recreational park for gods sake, I’m not likely to need many bullets, who would have even thought I would be sent out with a psycho? I felt a slight stab of betrayal when I thought more about that. Did Diane and Barrett know about Eric?

Both had looked displeased to see him, was I a sacrifice here? Were they all in on it?! My thoughts were interrupted suddenly then by a familiar chilling screech. The same one I had heard the night before, only it was closer, MUCH closer. I noticed then that Eric wasn’t really even looking at me. His attention was focused on something past me. A wave of nausea washed over me as I slowly turned toward the sound. The creature that made it was crouched barley 20ft away from me, it was the size of a bear and had no face. Instead it only had a mass of teeth that extended ridiculously far back into its skull area with a patch of wrinkled skin on top of its head where a human might have hair. Despite this somehow I felt as though it was watching me.

The wrinkles on it’s head suddenly flared open and I realised it was taking a deep breath in. It then turned more whole bodily towards me, focusing it’s malice on me.

“Not going to shoot it?” Eric mocked calmly. His voice cut through the tension like a sharp knife. I had forgotten about him for a moment, truthfully when facing something that defied all reason I felt a primal terror so pure that I can’t even accurately describe it. My mind struggled desperately to rationalise this thing that was absolutely nothing alike to anything I had ever before experienced nor even heard of. Time seemed to slow down for me because I remember the next few details extremely vividly.

First was how calm Eric looked, it was like he was looking at something as common as a household dog. Second was that when the creature jumped at me it’s entire body uncoiled horrifically. It had no tail, but folds of skin along its sides between its limbs flared open so that it glided on makeshift wings. I didn’t have time to scream or even the time to raise my weapon, but somehow Eric suddenly stood between the creature and myself.

He shoved me back hard and I fell into the mud. I heard my gun go off just once as I landed because my finger slipped on the trigger. I have no idea where the shot went.

I was too busy watching the scene before me unfold. I was certain that Eric was about to be dismembered by this beast when he raised his disfigured arm. Putting it between himself and the creature he slashed through the thing mid flight like a knife through butter. Blood sprayed in all directions over him, over me, and over the surrounding vegetation. It landed in two seperate pieces with individual impacts. The chunks twitched, writhing on the ground as if the thing were still alive and trying to reassemble. In the cold air steam rose from the pieces and the soft rain expanded the blood pooling exponentially.

When I regained my voice I stammered out, "W-what was that.. *Thing*?”

“I don’t give them names.” Eric answered now cradling his monster arm in his good arm, “Now get up, I want to be back before midnight.”

For a few more moments I was too stunned to move, and when I tried to stand my legs gave way twice before I succeeded. They felt like jelly. I wanted to ask more questions but couldn’t find the right words to form the sentences so I merely followed Eric’s lead and began walking back. I noticed he now walked without a limp and without his cane. It hung in the crook of his elbow instead. I thought better of asking about it though, especially given that half an hour prior I had been about ready to shoot him.

\*\*\*

Eric and I walked back into the office like zombies. Damp from the rain, covered in blood and dirt. Sherif Barrett looked up from his news paper and scoffed, “Cover that thing up.” He grumbled, obviously referring to Eric’s demon arm as he tossed him a fresh roll of bandages. Eric caught the roll effortlessly with an amused look on his face.

“Always a warm greeting.” He commented as he began to re-wrap his limb.

“Is it alright if I put in my incident report tomorrow?” I asked to break the tension.

“No.” Sherif answered gruffly.

“No?” I echoed disappointed.

“No, I don’t want to see any report on this. I don’t believe in any of that, mumbo jumbo stuff. I don’t want to hear another word on it actually.”

“What are we supposed to tell the families?” I asked trying to subdue the irritation in my voice, I risked my life for this assignment.

“Diane has prepared the report for you, read it, repeat what it says if anyone asks you.” He instructed.

Somehow that didn’t surprise me. I thought back to the few rare cases of massacres in the past, I couldn’t help but wonder if each was a similar situation to the one I had just experienced. I wondered also about when the next time another ‘incident’ would happen. Would I be able to return to my normal duties without thinking about that \*thing\* out there. About whether or not there were more of them?

It made me anxious to think about the next time a hiker disappeared or a campsite was found abandoned. Would the explanation be something normal? Or would we be calling Eric Linnaeus again? I shuddered at the thought, I didn’t want to see his arm again anytime soon. As it was Eric left silently without any of us noticing. He vanished from our little office and melted into the darkness like a ghost. I was relieved when I realised he had gone, but also slightly guilty.

I realised everyone probably felt that way about him: relief when he was gone. I imagined him walking alone in the rain. Perhaps he would go home, or maybe he would move on to the next call for help in facing unexplained phenomena. The man had saved my life, and probably the lives of others as well. I should have at least thanked him.

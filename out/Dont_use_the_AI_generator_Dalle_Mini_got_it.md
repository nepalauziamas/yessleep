My brother. I miss him. He had a 'theory'. Let's just say he proved 'his' own theory at the expense of himself. It was on a cold Monday evening when he had typed 'hotel' in the AI image generator 'Dalle Mini'. Do not ask why he typed in 'hotel'. But yeah, he's a clever, yet dumb bastard. 

He had pointed out how the generated images appeared dreamlike due to the fuzziness and blurriness of the photos. You know, most of our dreams are fuzzy to an extent. And in one of the images you can see a freaky humanoid. The humanoid had sharp teeth and really big eyes. It wasn't friendly. The humanoid was in the image probably due to the errors when generating the photos... right? You have to hope that's the case just for the sake of sleeping peacefully tonight.

My brother believed that he came up with the theory that they are photographs of real dreams. And so he explored, and explored and explored. Too much for his own good. It didn't help that throughout the day I was constantly feeding his OCD and his intrusive thoughts by scaring him, saying that when he goes to sleep he'll end up in the dream and be stuck there forever. Just big brother things, you wouldn't understand. 

You're not meant to think too much about the hotel, or the weird humanoid. I wish I had known this. But oh wait - I did know this. I smile just thinking about the torture he is receiving. He didn't deserve it. But still, I couldn't see his face any longer. He was the last enemy.

I made him type in 'hotel'. I knew about his awful OCD and intrusive thoughts. I knew about the hotel dream and how it gets you stuck there forever, alone with the disturbing humanoid. I knew it all. My brother didn't pull the trigger on my mother when I told him to. Does it matter anyway? Not really because she's stuck in a different hotel dream alone with the humanoid. Just like my brother is now. Too bad they're in different dreams. 

I don't think it's fair to say I'm evil. You don't just give the most love to the younger sibling, that's just not how it works. I would've spared her, she was good before my brother came. Too bad not all good things last. I had to. My father gave me an equal amount of love to my brother, and so that's why I let my brother grow up until he became 18, just so that my father can cherish his last moments with him, without even realising what would happen. 

I made sure that he was gone the day he reached 18, because that is when he would move out of his father's house and disappear on his birthday. Or may I say, deathday. It's been 3 months. My father believes my son has quit all contact with him. Mainly because I told him that. Now he hates his removed son and loves me even more. Poor guy doesn't know what actually happened. It's probably best anyway. I know I'm good. I had to. Don't doubt me. I'm good. I had to.

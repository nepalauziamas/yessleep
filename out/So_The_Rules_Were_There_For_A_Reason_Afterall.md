Recently, I lost my job. I don’t want to get into details. Just know it involved a Denny’s, a bike chain, and someone’s temple. Now I’m on probation and my latest job was odd. You’d think working as an ice cream scooper at Cold Sone Creamery would be easy. Then again, I have to imagine most or none of their other locations have what mine did. In particular, a strange list of rules. I stared down at them and then back up at my boss.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“This for real?” I inquired, raising a brow.

&#x200B;

“I know it’s weird,” Lawrence replied “But trust me on this, Craig, you do not want to break any of those rules.”

&#x200B;

“Has anyone broken them before?” 

&#x200B;

“Yeah.”

&#x200B;

“And what happened to them?”

&#x200B;

“I’ll only say that it was nothing good. If you don’t believe me also remember that we pay you.”

&#x200B;

“Fine, I’ll follow the stupid rules.”

&#x200B;

“Good.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I watched him get in his car and then drive for real. I glanced down at the list, making sure I was indeed reading it right. I’ll put them below.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*1. Don’t be late or leave until all work is done. It hates unpunctuality.*

*2. Don't ask who it is or acknowledge it’s there. If you do, hide and pray.*

*3. After dark, make sure to wipe and polish all glass every hour. It likes things clean.*

*4. In addition to keeping all equipment clean, make sure you don’t use the wrong scooper with the wrong ice cream. They will be labeled.*

*5. Wash your hands. It hates dirty people.*

*6. Before you clean out the machine, leave a specific kind of ice cream on the mat outside the entrance.  Make sure you leave the door open. There’s a rule 6 calendar in the back. You will hear eating accompanied by the sound of a child giggling ten minutes after you walk away from the ice cream. When you do, ignore it until it stops. Then close the door.*

*7. Only two breaks a day.*

&#x200B;

*8. No taking from the register.*

&#x200B;

*Please follow this list. It’s for your safety.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I shook my head, scoffing at the list. I asked a coworker about it and he said they were dead serious. I shrugged, figuring as long as the pay was good, I shouldn’t complain. For over two months, I followed the rules exactly even though it made me feel like a dumbass. Honestly, I was under the assumption the list was some kind of newbie prank. They were waiting on me to break so they could freak me out and see my reaction.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I wasn’t about to fall for their little game. Although, I did wonder how they were making that child laughing sound.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“They think they’ll get me to crack?” I would think with a chuckle. “They got another thing coming.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

On my last shift, it all came to head. The last month of work was extremely grueling for me, especially with Spring Break. On top of that, I was expected to handle it alone. For the entirety of my work period, I dealt with complaining parents and shrieking bratty kids. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Why me?” I wondered as they would wail.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The only silver lining was that I was supposed to have the next week off. When all the customers left, I went to the back to get some cleaning supplies. While there, I happened by the billboard. My legs came to an abrupt stop. Then I slowly backed up, doing a double-take on something I read that my brain was refusing to register. In front of me was the new work schedule and I was once again scheduled for the entire week.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I looked at it for a moment and blinked. Then when I finally comprehended what my brain saw, I yelled in rage, ripping the schedule off the wall and throwing it on the ground.  I stormed back to the counter, pacing back and forth with agitation. My eyes fell upon the rule list. At that moment, something inside me finally snapped

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Know what?” I screamed. “Fuck you all.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My actions were now being performed through a shade of red. I proceed to make a mess. After scratching my balls inside my underwear, I proceeded to throw ice cream with my unwashed hands and smothered it all over the display glass and windows. Then I threw the scoopers with the wrong ice cream. By the way, I should mention that the calendar for rule six specified that no sorbet was to be left out. I took a handful of it and slammed it on the ground outside.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Come get it, assholes,” I yelled and spat on it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Needless to say, I lost my cool. Little did I know, it was about to cost me. Before going inside, I emptied my bladder on the melty frozen treat. I did make sure to leave the door open. The noise came again only this time it was a child crying instead of giggling. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Without looking, I grabbed a scooper, chucking toward the sound as hard as I could. It hit someone, causing them to cry out in pain.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Aha,” I cried out triumphantly, pointing at who I thought would be a coworker. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Instead, there was something that made my breath stop. Before me was a creature that I can only describe as resembling several sporks fused together. Its head was spork-shaped along with its legs. Its body was thin and so were its arms which ended in spork-shaped fingers. Brown leathery skin covered its body. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The many eyes in its head darted around, inspecting my now extremely regrettable handiwork. It blinked, staring from the messes back to me. A moment or two went by and it went apeshit. I screamed as it leaped at me with the fury of a thousand spork.  Luckily, I managed to jump out of the way and its fingers went into the wall.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It pulled out a large chunk, hurling it at my head. I ducked and it broke one of the windows. My next move was to use it as an exit. Unfortunately, the spork monster wasn’t having that. I had incurred its wrath and it wanted blood.  The back of my shirt was grabbed and then I got flung across the store, smashing into the display.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I groaned in pain from all the fresh cuts. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Look,” I croaked out. “I’m sorry, but how was I supposed to know?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It let out a growl and leaped upon me. I wondered in panic as it was attempting to claw my face off why they didn’t warn me about this creature. Then again, I probably wouldn’t have believed “Oh, by the way, if any of these rules are broken, you’ll get murdered by a spork monster” either. You’d think places with that kind of shit going on would be closed until further notice. I guess it makes enough money to justify the casualties from a purely business perspective.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Despite its physique, the spork monster’s strength was incredible. My leg was the only thing standing between me and one bad hair day. Bad because I would’ve been killed which in addition to being an undesired state also seriously hinders self-maintenance.  I cursed, mind going a mile a minute while trying to shove it off.   I could only take so much pressure and my knee was beginning to buckle.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“You’ve gotta be fucking kidding me,” I said in terrified disbelief that this was going to be how I died.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Fortunately, my peripheral happened upon an item that saved my life. A container of lemon sorbet was lying on its side. Thankfully, it was within reach. I grabbed a bunch of it and shoved it in the spork monster’s face.  Instantly, it started wailing in pain, trying to get it off. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I shoved it back and scrambled to my feet. Then I bounded out the broken window and towards my car.  I hit the unlock button on my keys and I got inside, slamming the door after me.  As I was turning the ignition, I heard the growling of a really pissed-off cryptid. I glanced up and shrieked as I saw the spork monster was in midair, diving at my window.  

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It broke the glass and I frantically slammed on the gas. In my panic, I forgot to put my car in reverse. Therefore, instead of backing up, I ended up curving forward and destroying the entrance to the insurance agency next to the store. This did work to my advantage in that it shook off the spork monster. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Shit,” I hissed, quickly correcting my mistake and backing up.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My tires went over the sidewalk and onto the adjacent street. Once my car was put in reverse, I hit the gas right as the spork monster was about to give chase again.  Despite the creature’s bloodlust, its persistence ended where the parking lot did. Although, it did stare, roaring as I was driving away. I’m sure it goes without saying my employment was promptly terminated.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

A bit of a legal dispute followed. They,  meaning corporate and the owners of that store, wanted me to pay for the damages. I pointed out to them how fucked up it was to have people working at a place where they can get torn apart by some weird-ass creepy-looking spork thing. Not wanting to get counter sued, they decided to cut their losses and pay for the repairs themselves. As an aside, I may have shifted the blame for wrecking the insurance agency

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That wasn’t to say I got off scot-free. As a result of the incident, I’ve been permanently banned from any and all Cold Stone Creamery locations. They told me if they ever found out I went to one, there would be serious consequences. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

 Initially, I was disappointed because that was the only one for miles. Then I thought to hell with them. I’ll go to Bruster’s instead. Their ice cream is probably just as good if not better. Not to mention, they don’t have freaky spork monsters.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

 Speaking of which, my perception of that utensil has been forever changed and I’ll never be able to see the Cold Stone Creamery logo without thinking about my terrifying experience. Since then, I always keep a container of sorbet in my freezer. Now if you’ll excuse me, I got some job hunting to do. Then I’ll be treating myself by eating some Bruster’s to spite [those](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesFromRose/) Cold Stone [Bastards.](https://twitter.com/RoseBlack2222)

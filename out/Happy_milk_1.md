Week #1- Oct 21st

  I have loved milk since I can remember. Obviously, I don’t need to get into why. That’d be kinda weird. But about a month ago my local grocery store started supplying a new brand called “Happy Milk.”
Now, my town is pretty damn small with only 20,000 people, so I know most of the store owners and are pretty familiar with them. I decided to ask one of the managers what they thought of this new product, and surprisingly, she told me, “What is that? We don’t carry those here.” 

  Confused, I showed her the milk aisle and there they were, plain as day. 
“What the-? No one came in to stock these today. How did they even get here? Just a sec, lemme check with another manager.”
I stayed and waited for a moment, reading the ingredients label. 
Huh. That’s odd. 
Ingredients:
Milk, Happy

  What the fuck is happy? How is that an ingredient? Is this even pasteurized? 
Susie, the head of the store came over to the aisle a moment later, 
“Hey Jim, how ya doin today?”

“I’m doin’ pretty alright! This milk is pretty strange though, I’ve never seen it before. Do you know what happiness is?”

“Huh?”

“It’s an ingredient, I can’t figure out what it means.”

She grabbed a carton from the shelf, examining it closely. 

“Jim, I’ve never seen this product in my life. What is happiness? Is this even FDA approved?”

“I dunno, but hell, it can’t be too bad to try, right?”

“Uh. No. You probably shouldn’t buy that. We didn’t get that today in our stock. I actually have no idea how that got here.” 

“Well, since there’s no price on it, could I just take it?” 

“That’s… a good point. There’s no bar code either. Sure. I mean, don’t drink it though. I’d send it off to a lab if at all possible.”

  I took two cartons. One for personal experimentation, and one to send off to my buddy who has some expertise in lab testing.

  I got home and chilled the milk for an hour before I had the courage to open it.

  Huh, it smells like normal milk. 

  I took a small glass and poured some out for myself. I looked at it for a moment. Everything was normal. Why not? Let’s take a sip.

  My good god it was the best fucking milk I had ever had. That shit was like god himself was blessing my taste buds- all from a single sip. 

  I drank the rest of the carton in a single go, and nothing happened. T’was all good. 
By 10:00 pm, I was thirsty for that other carton. So I drank it, just half, and then I headed off to bed. 

  I woke up the next morning feeling fucking fantastic! Everything went well that day, my work was treating me great, I got a raise, my girlfriend gave me a blowjob, I mean it was perfect down to the last minute detail. 
I decided to drink the other half of the carton the next day, and even gave some to my girlfriend. 

“Jim, what the fuck is happy milk?”

“It’s good! Try it!”

“The ingredients say fucking happiness on it! What is happiness? That doesn’t make any sense!”

“Just try it. A sip won’t kill you. I drank a carton of it yesterday.”

She took a sip, looking down at her glass.

“Wow. This is actually pretty good. Where did you get this?”

“Just the grocery store!”

“Let’s go get some more!”

  The next week was pretty damn near ecstacy. Something about this milk made life good.
It made my boss laid back, helped me lose a bit of weight, and my god my and my gf’s libido was crazy. 

  Then I started having strange dreams. Two people I have never met before in my life started coming up to me every night and telling me, “you don’t have much time left.”
Every single fucking minute they’d say that. And those dreams felt like a genuine 8 hours. It was hell. They had no eyes. I felt a constant deep fear like something was watching me, but always just out of sight. My girlfriend didn’t report any bad dreams, which made me happy for her. 

  For the next week, I kept having the exact same dream. I always woke up in a cold sweat. But, damn I mean that milk is fuckin worth it. My life in a single week seems to have gotten so much better.

Week #2
  The dreams keep happening. But at the end of them, now I can hear something running towards me at full speed. It’s fucking terrifying. I can now talk in those dreams, they’ve become real enough that I’m lucid in them. But I can’t move. It’s like my body knows it’s asleep, but my mind is on a constant loop.

  I just make fun of the eyeless, soulless creatures sometimes, saying “you don’t have much time left, you fuckin demon ugly ass bitches!”

  But, at the end of the 10th day of those dreams, I went into a boy's body. 
The time was 4:30 pm. He got a knock at his door from his mom I presume. 

“Hi honey!”

“Hey! I’ll be out in a moment.”

  Then I see her when he opens the door. The woman in my dreams with no eyes who tells me that I have no time left. But, she’s normal. I’ve never seen her in my life. How can my brain conjure this image? 

  Then just a few moments later, he goes back into his room for ~15 minutes. I look at the date and time October 21st. 
Huh.

Then I heard a banging, then the dream stopped.

  I’ll update you guys more about these dreams as they continue. I wonder why the date was readable though. Usually in dreams most times/dates are jumbled. Oh well, it might mean something but… I don’t care. This milk is too good. 

  If you guys have any ideas on why I might be having these dreams, I’d love to discuss ideas. I did end up sending a small sample to my friend's lab, so when he reaches back to me I’ll also update you guys.

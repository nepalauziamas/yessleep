The fluorescent lights flickered endlessly above, hurting my eyes as I waited patiently on my name being called. I'd been sitting in the same uncomfortable waiting room chair for god knows how long and my backside was becoming sweaty and irritated from the cheap synthetic leather cushioning.


I glanced around the reception area of my local doctor's practice, the pristine white interior now so familiar. All the other seats were empty. Unusual, given it was a Monday. The day all the old crones would typically populate the space in droves, eager to moan and complain about life's impartial cruelty to anyone that would pretend to listen. Desolate. I hadn't even noticed a receptionist manning the desk on my way in. Like a good boy, I had found a chair and planted myself without a second thought. I was early after all.


I made my way over to the front desk and rang the antique little bell that they still continued to use after all the years I had been coming there. Shiny and functional despite its age. It echoed out, carrying long enough to make me uncomfortable. Nothing but a jarring silence followed. Now it really was obvious. Dead silence. No chatter, wheeling of chairs or the coughing and retching of the sick. Nothing.


A chill ran through me like I was being stared down by some wild beast, ready to tear me limb-from-limb and consume my meaty parts.


I turned around, staring through the glass sliding doors at the cold, muggy day. It was starting to rain again. Cars were parked in the small lot outside, clearly someone must have been home.


I rang the bell several more times, becoming increasingly frustrated with each sharp ding.


"Forget it!" I said aloud to noone, spinning around and walking the short distance down the hall and out the sliding doors. I hurried over to my car in an attempt to escape the incoming shower, beeping it open as I did and jumping inside. When I slammed the door shut behind me, I instantly realised something was very, very wrong.


The sleek interior leather scent of my coupé was replaced by the strong stench of bleach and dank water, the warm seats by cold concrete. My relief by shocked terror. I sprang to my feet, feeling around in the darkness until my fingers met a switch, flipping it dimly illuminated the area in faint flickerings. A supply cupboard?


A mop bucket filled with dirty water and a row of metal shelving containing sealed packets of A4 paper were my only companions. I lunged forward, turning the handle and throwing the door open. I was in some sort of office building. A long windowless hallway stretched before me, seemingly endless in both directions. 


I stumbled out from the dark closet and made my way forward. Trying the doors on either side accomplished nothing at first, locked. I walked for hours until finally a handle turned completely, relinquishing its mysterious insides. Darkness. Impenetrable darkness. I had a lighter in my pocket, sparking its flame made no difference as I held it into the black. For all I knew there was no floor, no walls and no ceiling. My first step could very well be one into an infinite abyss, tumbling downwards for all time.


No. I slammed the door shut and trudged along further, now more incensed than afraid. Another few hours went by and once again, a handle turned and revealed the unknown. This time, light. Near-blinding light. It invited me in and I held my arms outstretched as I crossed the threshold.


There was no ground. The light scorched my eyes as I soared very ungracefully downward, screaming all the way. No wind rippled my cheeks as I fell face first, and then, once more I was somewhere else.


A library. Rows and rows of books created a roofless corridor ahead of me, each large oak bookcase giving way to another interchanging corridor. I opted not to take any turns and just like in the 'office', I stayed true. Never deviating much in fear of getting lost. Although there clearly was no being 'lost' there, just by being there I was lost and I realised that any rationality I brought with me was now useless.


Again, I continued for several hours, vainly hoping to be met with a wall in the distance, something, anything to indicate I was even in a real building anymore. That hope was rapidly dwindling, my resolve all but turning to blind panic, when something to my right caught my eye. It was a little girl.


Sitting among a mess of books, her bright pink dress stood out vibrantly against the brown backdrop of the library. I approached cautiously and at a snail's pace, working up the nerve to address the inexplicable child.


Her focus was on a thick novel, eyes pointing straight down as she intently scanned it's pages, flipping to the next every so often. Her ebony brown hair draped down, obscuring her face. 


When she looked up at me, I realised that she in fact didn't have a face at all. Her head was there, but where the features should have been was just an endlessly empty dark chasm. 


For some reason, I wasn't frightened. I lifted up my arm and with an open palm I pushed it through into the blackness of the girl's face. It swallowed me.


I screamed aloud like I'd had an intense night terror and I fell out of my seat, startling the other people in the waiting room. I apologised broadly before hurrying off to the disabled bathroom by the reception desk. Locking the door behind me, I checked myself out in the mirror and splashed water over my sweaty forehead. 


After taking a few deep breaths I peeked out into the waiting area, where all was normal. A few pensioners shot me a glare, clearly disturbed by my sudden awakening, but that was it. Shaking, I stepped outside and began to make my way to the sliding front doors, the gloomy weather outside appearing as the salvation from this nightmare.


"The doctor will see you now!" The receptionist called after me, but I kept going, quickening my pace, desperate to feel the rain on my skin. 


I burst into the car park and into my Mercedes, peeling out dangerously onto the road home. 


The front door slammed shut behind me and I bolted the locks, finally allowing myself to relax. It was over. It was only a dream. 


I had a whisky, then dinner, some more whisky, and then as I watched the sun go down through my bedroom window I nestled in for the night. Glad to be free. 


I woke up in that same supply cupboard. Every way out is a lie. A sick joke designed to toy with me. 


I don't know why I'm here. I don't know what I've done to deserve this, but whatever it was, I am so sorry. Please. I can't keep turning doorknobs and falling into light voids and dark pits. I can't escape the children, faceless, all of them. They call out to me, and they're so loud. They want me dead, I know it. No, not dead. Something worse. Even worse than this terrible purgatory, I just know it. 


The time tally I keep etching into the walls to keep track of the days has filled the entirety of the tiny room, the sickening bleach smell ever-present despite my moving the mop bucket when I decided to make my new 'home' here. 


All those little black lines, floor to ceiling. Too many to count at this point, too many to even fathom. Though my body doesn't rot and my stomach never growls, I ache for life as though they did. Or death, whichever the powers that be decide for me, that coming day is all that keeps me going.


The depressing sameness of this place, these places. They have clear differences and yet the feeling remains the same. A tedious dread, an agonising loneliness. How I long to watch these walls fall apart and degrade, the way they would in a natural world. I miss decay.

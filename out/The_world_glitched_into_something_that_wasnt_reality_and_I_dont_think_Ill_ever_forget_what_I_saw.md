It felt like a video game, a similar experience to seeing a loading map that you weren’t supposed to see or somehow glitched out of. It was a little over 3 years now and pre covid of course. I was on my usual long haul flight from New York to Seoul on business. These trips felt second hand to me and for the most part I looked forward to them. Investor meetings, dinners, occasional  club outings and even a couple days to my self.

But this time was different. Very different. I boarded my red eye from JFK to Incheon international and laid back in my seat bed to get a head start on the 14 hour flight and to hopefully diminish some of the eventual inbound jet lag. After a couple hours they brought out breakfast and this is where things started to not make sense. I walked towards the bathrooms in the business class section where I found two female flight attendants sitting in a motionless and expressionless state in the food prep stations sitting like robots. I was confused but before I could say anything as fast as I blinked they were on two separate parts of the space one pouring coffee and the other microwaving one of the pre made meals. I quickly turned around to reach for the bathroom door and splashed water on my face. “What the hell” I remember saying under my breath. I figured i wasn’t fully awake yet and maybe my brain was in a similar state to deja vu and hadn’t fully processed the situation and created this “lag” if you will for what my eyes were seeing. I discarded the thought as I went back to my seat.

9 hours later we arrived in Seoul. It was a beautiful day. Not a cloud in sight and a warm summer breeze rushing over the landscape. The usual driver our firm used was there waiting for me to take me to the hotel and as usual grabbed my bags and offered me complimentary goodies for the ride ahead. It’s funny cause I don’t remember the drive, I guess I’ve never really paid attention because the city is so big and it’s not like I’d remember the streets or turns but this time I especially couldn’t recall how we got to the hotel so fast but once we arrived I was already pre checked in and I made my way to the elevator bank. Once inside the elevator I pressed level 22 and as soon as the door shut the elevator moved down versus up, I was confused and repeatedly pressed the button that said 22 on it. The elevator abruptly stopped, suddenly all the buttons started going haywire and the lights began to flicker uncontrollably. I started yelling for help as the elevator didn’t open its doors on any floor and it appeared I was stuck in between two different basement level floors. 

*POP* 

All I remember is a very loud pop, almost as loud as a firework going off next to my ear. I thought the elevator snapped as it was pitch black. Suddenly the elevator doors opened and I looked up to see the ground above me yet somehow I could see through it. A thin platform was dimly illuminated and I began to put my hand on it to see if it would hold my weight. It was some kind of solid material but nothing I had ever seen before. I walked out on the platform still in shock that I could see the surface above me including the buildings, people walking, cars turning in traffic and even all the pipes and sewage tunnels. I decided to call out to see if anyone was there “Hello?” I yelled. What followed were echoes of my voice in all directions. I froze. My body went cold and my hands began to sweat. Where was I? Is this a dream? Was I drugged? what was happening to me? 

My questions quickly became more questions as a very dark figure made its way to me. Saying nothing I quickly turned back and walked toward the direction of the elevator but to my surprise was not there anymore. The figure said something to me in a language I’ve never heard before that almost sounded like a bunch of radio frequencies merging to create words. “Stop” it said. I turned around expecting the worst but to my surprise the figure just stood there observing me. I asked what it was and more importantly where I was. It replied with “this is beyond your cognition or understanding and that I was not supposed to see this” it then left me with “ your reality is constructed and designed only when we look at it” yet somehow I had seen the truth behind the veil. Before I could ask what the figure was I blinked and was in my hotel room. A sudden knock on the door startled me but as I opened the door it was simply my colleague welcoming me back to the country. 

To this day I’m not sure what the figure was or the realm I somehow glitched into as I’ve never experienced it since but whenever I’m going about my day I make sure the reality I’m observing is really…real.

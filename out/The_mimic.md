I’ve been thinking about it a lot lately. I call it the mimic. When I was 17 for almost a whole year almost every time my mom and sister were out of town for the day shopping and I was home alone I’d hear it. 
Keys jingling in the front door, the click of the lock, the scrape of the door sliding opened and closed as the dogs rush to the front door, barking to greet whoever just came home. 
I’d hear my mom or sister tell the dogs to stop and that they ‘live here’ and the dogs would stop barking and go about their business. I would get up and go to say hi and help out things away and nobody would be there. 
It stopped happening once I started staying in bed and calling my mom to see where they were instead of getting up to greet them. 

Once after my mom had surgery she was staying at her parents place for a few weeks to heal. I brought my dog for a walk and when I came home my moms dog, who was asleep in her room, started barking. 
I heard my mom tell her ‘Shelby stop barking’ and after a few more barks she listened and stopped. I ran to my moms room to say hello, I hadn’t seen her in a few weeks at that point and didn’t know she was coming home, but her room was empty. 
I still don’t know what it was or why the dogs listened to the disembodied voice. I don’t know why it was stealing my families voices. A lot of other shit happened at that apartment, from knocking in (yes, IN) the walls to claws scraping down my closet door.

This is 100% true has anyone ever experienced something similar?

In the same apartment, my sister had just left to her boyfriends and my mom was at work, I started feeling sick one day. I grabbed a banana and went to my room to try and feel better. Almost as soon as I got on the bed I heard a knocking coming from inside the walls. I could replicate it exactly by knocking my knuckle against the wall. 
I called my sister crying because I didn’t know what it was and she came home, but just before the front door opened the knocking stopped. She made sure I was alright then left again and everything was quiet. 
I stood up to go throw my banana peel away and as I was walking past my closet and out of my bedroom I heard one final knock in the walls. 
A few months later I rearranged my bedroom and set up a little reading corner where I was leaning against my closet in a little blanket nest I made on the floor. 
It only happened when I was leaning against the door for over 20 minutes, but any time I would be reading in my little nest I would hear, and feel the vibrations of the door rumbling against my back, what sounded like claws dragging down the inside of the closet door trying to get out. 
It only happened three times before I rearranged my room again. This time I put my bed against the closet door so anything in there couldn’t get out. Mind you my closet was completely full to the top, a kitten couldn’t fit in there. So I don’t know where the sound was coming from but it certainly wasn’t the three garbage bags pressing against the door. 
I still heard things coming from my closet after moving my bed against it but I felt safer knowing it couldn’t get out. I still don’t know what was in that apartment but I’m glad it didn’t follow me when we left.

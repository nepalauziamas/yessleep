We spent some time that day unpacking some of our things – boxes of clothes, glasses, utensils, that kind of thing. I pottered around in the garden – which was lush, but totally overgrown. While poking around in the tall grass, we found what seemed to be an urn. I actually knocked it over on accident – and to my horror, the lid wasn’t sealed and came straight off. I know I shouldn’t have touched it – but I was horrified of what I might find inside and surprised the last owner would have left it the garden. To my intense relief, when I peered inside, it was empty. Assuming it was the urn of an old beloved pet whose ashes had been scattered, I put the lid back on then placed it carefully where I’d found it. 

That wasn’t the only thing we found in the house. It was kind of strange, like some items had simply been forgotten or left. There was an old blow dryer in the bathroom cupboard which came with the house, and an ugly painting rolled up in one of the wardrobes. At the back of one of the kitchen drawers, we found a bent photograph of one of the last owners – an old woman sitting at a round dining table in the kitchen with a young woman – presumably her daughter. From what we’d heard from the neighbours when buying the house, an old woman had lived in the house with her daughter. The old woman had been sick and her daughter cared for her. Rumour was that the old woman had grown too unwell and had been moved into a respite or nursing home. The young woman sold the house. It was strange to see them photographed in the house I now stood, that I had bought. Like peering into another life - the life of the house, its history, how it had been used before us. It was strange like looking at a different house entirely, a feeling similar to seeing a photo of yourself captured from another angle. 

 As it started to get dark, I cooked a simple dinner of eggs and whatever vegetables we had on hand, while Elly went through her routine of closing the curtains and locking the doors. When she returned, I asked (even though I was pretty sure I had seen her do it) if she had locked the front. She nodded and smiled, like she knew that I would ask. 

We sat by the fire until late drinking wine and listening to the rain lash against the windows. When we went to bed, I was a little drunk – we were both a little drunk – and I passed out straight away. At some point during the night I woke up feeling a little sick. I rolled over to reach for my girlfriend and realised she wasn’t there. The bed was cold and empty. This wasn’t altogether strange – when she had trouble sleeping, she would often get up and read on the couch. When she was tired, she’d come back to bed. But I couldn’t see any lights on, and the bed was cold, which suggested she’d been gone a while. I got up to see if she was okay. The house was in darkness. For some reason I felt uneasy. The house was freezing without the warmth of the fire. I peered into the rooms as I passed, but they were empty and still unfurnished, so I didn’t really expect her to be in any of them. The bathroom door was shut, and the light was out. 

In the living room, I found her sitting in the armchair in the dark. 

My heart gave a turn. 

‘El?’ 

She didn’t answer. 

There was a quiet scratching sound. 

I stood in the doorway, waiting for her to turn. She continued to stare forward, as if she hadn’t heard me. 

She didn’t respond. 

I went to her. 

I’m not sure why, but my heart sped up. I was about to reach out to her shoulder from behind, but something stopped me. Instead I walked around to face her. 

In the dark, she stared straight ahead, seeing nothing. 

I looked down at her hands and placed the scratching sound; it was the fingernails of her two index fingers as she dragged them along the scratch marks in the arms of the chair that were already there. 

I leaned in closer.

 ‘El?’ 

She continued to stare as if in a trance. Still, I couldn’t make myself touch her; something about the whole situation felt off. I worried that if she was sleep-walking I might startle her or cause distress. Instead, I thought I’d better turn on the light – maybe she would wake in her own time, or go back to bed. It was too unnerving to wait around in the dark. I had heard stories about how one should gently steer a sleepwalker back to bed, but I wasn’t quite sure how.

Her head snapped round as I reached for the switch. 

She started through the dark, shadows making deep holes in the hollows of her eyes and cheeks.

‘Don’t turn on the light.'

I felt dread. 

Her tone was reprimanding, stern even, which was unlike how she spoke in waking life. 

Her look was sharp, as though someone else stared out from her eyes and through me. 

My hand was frozen as it hovered above the light switch. As I took it down, she turned away and went back to staring. 

I knelt in front of her. I reached out and – gently – touched her hand. Her skin was freezing. I frowned. ‘El?’ I tried again. ‘El, hun? You’re sleepwalking. You’ve gotta come back to bed.’ I spoke gently, rubbing the cold skin of her hand gently. To my surprise, she turned slowly and raised her eyes to mine. They were blank, vacant – in an eerie way. 

‘Can I come into the bedroom?’ she asked. 

I nodded and began to pull gently on her hand. ‘Yes,’ I told her. ‘Come to bed.’ 

I know she was sleepwalking, but I swear I had goosebumps on my neck at the look that came into her eyes. Like when someone smiles with their eyes, without moving their lips? I know it’s silly – but there’s something about a sleepwalker I find unnerving. What’s more, I’ve never known her to sleepwalk – occasionally when she is very stressed she sleep talks, but that’s been it. Once she woke me up because she couldn’t find the light switch and was confused. I assume it’s from all the stress with her health and being in a new house. 

When I took her to the bedroom, she climbed into the bed and let me cover her. ‘Close your eyes,’ I told her, because the staring through the dark was a little unnerving. She did.

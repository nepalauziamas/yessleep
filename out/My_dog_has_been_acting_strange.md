Recently I (M26) adopted a similar dog to my old family dog to try and cope with the death of my family's dog. The only problem is that she has been acting ***weird.*** At night I hear her making a high pitched howling/barking noise. She does it for about 8 minutes each night which has been scaring me like crazy. If anyone knows what's been happening with her, please reach out to me quickly.

**EDIT 1:** u/throwaway26796258 has messaged me about this whole situation. Apparently I shouldn't be concerned and that "It's a normal thing to happen with this type of dog." I'm still freaked out about the noises, but luckily she's starting to do it less. This is likely the only update I'm making, so don't expect much more.

**EDIT 2:** She stopped. Randomly she stopped making the noises, thank god. She has been starting to lay under my desk while making weird swallow/chugging noises. I still would like some help with this, and if anyone has an idea please reach out.

**EDIT 3:** She's gone. My dog has pretty much disappeared. I have no idea where she went or where she would have went. I'm scared for my life currently. Where did she go?

**EDIT 4:** I'm going crazy. According to my roommate, my dog never left, she never made the chugging sounds, and she never did the howling noise at night. I have no idea what's going on. I think I might be going crazy. What should I do?

**EDIT 5:** I didn't have a dog? According to my family, my roommate, my friends, etc. I never had a dog. Also when I came out of my room to tell my roommate about my dog going missing, he asked me "Where have you been?" (even though I talked to him yesterday) I've never been more confused. My apartment room has security cameras, so I'll make sure to check those. I should also go to the doctors to see if I really am losing my mind or not.

**EDIT 6:** I checked my security cameras, and I guess that I never left my room from the day that I got the dog through the day that she went missing. Later I'm going to the doctor's office to see if I'm truly losing my mind or not. I'm so scared, confused, etc.

**EDIT 7:** So, I went to the doctor's office. I have **Psychosis.** I'm losing my touch with reality. I'm starting to hallucinate. I've never been so scared, so confused, etc.

**EDIT 8:** My dog is back? In Edit 3, I talked about how my dog went missing, but today when I woke up, my dog was laying next to me. She wasn't making any of the weird noises or anything. She hasn't been moving at all, she has just been laying down all day. She seems cold, and she smells bad. I think that I might be Hallucinating again.

**EDIT 9:** She hasn't left. I don't think that I'm hallucinating.

**EDIT 10:** She's been dead. I just woke up and realized that when I was recording my webcam for a advertisement, I never turned off the webcam or the computer. I decided to look through the video. The day I remember buying the dog, in the video I came into my room with a black trash bag. I then proceeded to open it up to my family's dead dog. The video proceeded to show my staying in my room for 3 days straight, playing with the dog corpse. I guess that edit 4 never actually happened? On the 4th day at 3:16 AM, I put the dog in the black bag and left the room. At 4:58 AM, I come back into the room and sleep. At 12:58 PM, I leave my room and ask my roommate of what happened to my dog. Nothing weird happened on Edit 6 and Edit 7. The day after at 1:42 AM I left my room, and 2 hours later I brought back in the black bag and opened it up and put the corpse on my bed. Then I went to sleep. At 8:17 AM I woke up and started to freak out. As I'm writing this I have berried the bag with the dog. I haven't told anyone yet. I hope that this is the end of this. I hope at least.

I think someone is living in my walls

I have been scared to say something about this for years but here we go, I think someone is living in my walls. I live in a two story house with five bedrooms and two bathrooms, I live with my wife and kids. I moved into a new house back in 2014, I was excited to finally get my own house because previously I had been renting. The house was beautiful, the yard was big, and it had a great big porch in the front of the house. The inside was a different story, I always felt like someone was watching me from behind but I would look and nothing would be there. I was always to scared to confront my wife about because she would probably tease me for being scared or something like that.

I have always gotten up in the middle of the night to get a drink of water, I've been doing it since I was a kid, but after that day I stopped. As I'm pouring the water into my glass it gets to about half way full but then I hear a thump behind me, I stopped moving, I was frozen with fear but I didn't want to show it. I slowly turned around to try and see what caused the noise, nothing, nothing was there. I was a spooked but tried telling my self it was just my imagination from being up so late. I went back up the stairs slowly and quietly enough to try and hear something. I went to my bed and went to sleep, the next morning I asked my wife if she heard anything last night, she said she didn't hear anything.

I was extremally paranoid for a couple days but then forgot about it. everything was normal for a couple months. Until my daughter came running to my room crying her eyes out to scared to say what happened. my wife and me tried to get her to stop crying and tell us what happened. She told us that she seen her bookcase move and someone saying "hello girl" in a creepy and abnormal voice. That's when I remembered what happened months before. With fear taking over my body I ran to my little boys room grabbed him and took him into my bedroom after that I grabbed my gun and slowly walk towards my daughters room. Sure enough the book case is pushed about four feet away from the wall with a little door behind it, the window is also open.

I called the police right away they came and searched the area but found nothing, the next morning I with bravery out of nowhere decided to search where the hidden door was. The space in between the walls was extremely clean, there was no spider webs and dust was to a minimum. My family and me have bought camaras and sealed of the door. 

Unfortunately 3 years later he returned. It was a normal sunny day while we were having a barbecue with our extended family. It was all smiles and everyone was happy. We had basically forgotten about everything that has happened, the person was never found so I still keep my gun by my bed. After the barbecue everyone went home but my nieces wanted to spend the night with my daughter. We all to sleep and I wish my daughter and my nieces goodnight. I told my wife “I’m exhausted” and sighed. 

I’m awoken by a blood curdling scream I jolt out of bed and grab my gun. The girls come running to my bedroom all screaming in horror, my daughter says “He’s back dad he’s back” while sobbing. I start remember what Happened all those years ago. My wife is trying to calm them down. All I see is red, I wanted to kill that man. End things once and for all. I sprint down the stairs to my daughter’s room, and I found a man who look in his 40’s trying to find the little door-way. I can’t remember much after that, all I remember is seeing him dead on the floor. I don’t regret what I did, we never called the police. that man was never seen again, no one cared. We were just glad he was gone.

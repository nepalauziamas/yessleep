Alright, let’s start by setting up the context: In Spain prostitution is “alegal” which means it is not written in the law whet her it’s legal or not. Both right and left political parties have tried to change this without success. So to end up with the context prostitution is really common in Spain. (Sorry for my English btw)

Presentation:

My father is a businessman. Over the entire course of his life he has been selling things (paintings, movies…) But right now he is focused on selling lofts, a loft is a house located in the bottom floors of buildings which is known for it’s high floors. My dad sells his lofts in poor neighborhoods  for two reasons. The first one is pretty obvious: Is cheaper.

But the second one is not: He believes that by selling loft which are designed for middle upper class in poor neighborhoods he is “healing” the neighborhood. For example: Imagine someone buys his house and creates a restaurant, well at the end of the day the owner will end up hiring waiter’s from the neighborhood.

Now is where the story actually starts:

One night at about 9:00 PM my father received a call from an unknown girl. She told him that last night at about 4:00 AM someone knocked her door saying if the “paid girls were living here.” She was suspicious about that one of his lofts was actually being rented by the owner of the “night club.”

My dad immediately called the only person he had rented if he was the one who had the night club. He answered slowly and said:

“Yes”

My dad told him that he needed to leave immediately. He answered:

“Ok”

My dad told him that he was coming tomorrow to make sure he left. He finished the call by saying 

“I will”

I know I am really bad at summarizing stuff but pls keep on with me.

The next day My dad woke up at 5:30 AM, I know this because he woke up both me and my little brother. He was visibly nervous.

He went to his house with two of his workers as defense. The “owner” instead was alone. He just gave him the keys and left.

The next day some rings to our doorbell at 6:00 pm. He wants to see my dad. I tell him he isn’t home. 
That same afternoon my father tells all the family not to open anyone who wants to see him.

My father normally walks to his office, this time he goes on car. He is visibly paranoid.  I am not that nervous until when I was coming back from school (also walking) I notice someone’s is following me. He gets into the same building as me. But luckily I get to take the elevator first because “I am afraid of COVID” I open the house. Apparently there isn’t anyone home. 1 minute later someone rings the bell.

I do not open

He keeps ringing the bell

I do not open or make any noise

2 minutes later he leaves. 

I start crying.

My father calls me. He tells me if I am okay, I don’t tell him anything about the recent experience because I do not want him to feel more paranoid.

That same day at night we watch a happy movie. Someone rings the bell. My father gives me a bat and makes me hide. He opens:

No one is there. There is just a letter with bullets in the inside 

This is the end by now , tomorrow we will be going to the police station to make a proper denounce. Until then as a Christian I will really thank you to pray for me and my family.

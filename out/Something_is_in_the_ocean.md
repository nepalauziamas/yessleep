I use to love diving, exploring, that kind of stuff. But I will never do it again, because I know what’s waiting for me. A couple years ago I was a scuba diver and I always had a fascination with the deep sea.



I had always wanted to explore it, but never could, mainly because a deep sea submarine costs 48 million and I am not rich at all, and there is no way I am swimming down to the deep. I was at home watching some Netflix when my buddy Johnny calls me, he is a rich guy who owns some company involved law. He called me up and asked if I wanted to go into the deep ocean, I asked him how he got a submarine and he simply told me money. I said yes and started to pack simple things like food, water, entertainment, all the boring stuff.



I drove to the place he gave me which was a big port on the west coast, When I arrived only Johnny was there, I asked him “where is everyone?”, he replied saying how no one was willing to come with him and so it will be just the two of us. The only exception was the pilot of the boat that would take us to the ocean, we were going to some random place in the pacific, which was extremely remote and was super far away from any land mass or port. There wasn’t even an island at all, just water, while going to the location we passed by several warning signs, they said something along the lines of “WARNING, BEHEMOTH RISK”, I was puzzled and so were Johnny and the captain. I imagined what could possibly be out here, only a few miles away from the location we saw another sign, but this one was… different, it said “TURN BACK, LEVIATHAN WATERS” my mind started to race, I started to think about sea monsters swallowing ships whole, I thought any moment now huge tentacles would wrap around us and pull the boat under. I felt a hand on my left shoulder, Johnny was sat right next to me and told me “It probably is just referring to the weather”



He looked at me and gave me a reassuring grin, we had finally reached the location and Johnny and I were getting the sub into the water and after some pushing and pulling we got it off the boat, me and Johnny climbed inside and began our decent, at 11:22 we reached the bottom and we’re kinda disappointed that there was nothing to look at, me and Johnny were ready to go home when suddenly, We saw it… It was a dark blue patch, I couldn’t really make out the exact shape of it was until it got a little closer, it look like a giant anglerfish. It’s eyes were like a full moon, it’s teeth were crooked and sharp, me and Johnny were scared shitless. And so we tried to begin ascending until, the creature let out a huge roar, it was muffled but sounded like something from a video game, I thought about the monsters from subnautica that kill
you when you go outside the shallows. I shut my eyes knowing that the thing was only a few inches away from the sub, I waited 3 minutes which felt like three hours, and then it was gone, I immediately started going up as fast as I could, Johnny had passed out from fear and we were almost at the surface when… I heard another roar. I looked below me and the creature was swimming towards the sub at an alarming rate.




The sub had reached the surface, I opened the hatch and screamed Help! Frantically, The captain attached rope to the sub and started pulling, I jumped out of the sub and onto the boat and helped him pull. We eventually got it out the boat and Johnny woke up, we heard another roar and the captain immediately started to head for the nearest port. And, that’s it, me and Johnny continued on with life, of course I quit diving and he is now a huge CEO of a company. But some times at night I have night mares of that creature chomping me to bits,

I’ll never go back into the ocean

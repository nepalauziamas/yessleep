I couldn’t go back to work after Dylan came along. But after being stuck in the house all day every day, practically glued to my baby, I started to develop cabin fever. I found myself yearning for stimulation. For a project to sink my teeth into.

Then one morning, as my son watched his gazillionth Peppa Pig clip on Youtube, an interesting video popped up in the sidebar. *Teach your baby sign language in 5 easy steps*. That sounded like a neat pastime. Or at least a fun bonding opportunity. And hell, it couldn’t exactly *hurt* a child’s speech development, could it?

The lady made the process sound like an absolute sinch. When the baby wants milk, you mime holding a bottle. For hungry, pinch your fingers and touch them against your lips. And to signal sleepy, crane your hand like you’re making a shadow puppet on the wall.

Within six weeks, my son’s ‘repertoire’ had expanded to 25 gestures. Although there’s really only two you need to know about.

The first is ‘all done’. To signal ‘all done’, Dylan made a crude X with his forearms and raised them above his head. Unfortunately, it wasn’t long before ‘all done’ seemed like ‘you’re a terrible mother’.

When his highchair collapsed causing his skull to thud against the floor, Dylan screamed his little lungs out, simultaneously signing ‘all done’ over and over, like he expected me to make the pain go away as easily as I carted off his empty juice cup. And at the hospital, where he had to get four injections, he felt that first needle stab into his thigh then whipped his arms up and down. *All done, all done, all done.*

And there I stood, powerless to do anything except offer my sympathy, while he looked up at me, tears already forming in those big beautiful eyes, like I’d betrayed him. Like I’d broken our sacred agreement. *All done means make it stop, Mommy. Make it stop, Mommy. Please.*

The second gesture he picked up by accident. Mad Maggie, otherwise known as Margaret, roamed my estate, the friendly neighbourhood basket case. Dylan and I first encountered her down by the duckpond, on a cloudy November afternoon.

He was strapped into his stroller, completely fascinated by all the geese and pigeons that had swarmed over the breadcrumbs I’d tossed onto the ground. Then, from behind, a dry voice said: “YOU.” I looked over. There stood a lady in her sixties, skinny and shrunken and mostly bald. She glared at me, her wrinkled face twisted and red. “You,” she said again. “You stole him.” White spittle flew from her mouth as her eyes flicked towards Dylan.

“Excuse me?” I replied.

“You stole him,” she screamed, her mouth a grim, straight line. “You stole him.”

Before the situation could escalate any further, two passers-by—a grey-haired man with a moustache and a jogger in a light jacket—came between us, holding Maggie back while she thrashed, ranted, and shrieked. Although difficult to understand in her groggy, confused state, she seemed to be implying I’d kidnapped her baby.

Two police officers quickly arrived, explained Maggie was a well-known troublemaker, and warned her to stay away from me and Dylan.

“She’s harmless,” said the taller of the pair, his voice completely casual. He’d clearly dealt with the lady many times before. “Any trouble give us a call.”

Okay. Great. Good thing he acted so casual about the whole situation, otherwise I might have gotten worried.

Maggie started popping up everywhere I went, too frequently to be a coincidence. Whether at the butcher, the greengrocer, or the pharmacist, she always appeared, her bloodshot eyes fixated on my son. Each time I called the police, who let her off with a warning, since she ‘technically hadn’t done anything illegal’. More like since they *technically* didn’t want the paperwork.

Each time she appeared, at some point or another, I’d instinctively glance at Dylan and make the ‘cuckoo’ sign. I didn’t even realize I was doing it until he started copying me.

In mid-January, I caught a glimpse of the vile bitch lurking outside my home. Before the police could arrive, she made herself scarce, and from that point on, it felt like there was no escape from her. While holding Dylan, or feeding him, or changing him, I found myself constantly glancing over my shoulder, expecting the old hag to be pressed right up against a window, or crouched in the corner of the room.

On February 18th, I lived every mother’s worst nightmare. I’d just nipped into the bathroom, and upon returning to the kitchen I discovered broken glass spread across the floor. White curtains twisted in the breeze, and the back door swung back and forth, wildly.

Somebody had punched through a glass panel, reached inside, twisted the key, then snatched my son right out of his highchair.

I heard Dylan scream somewhere outside. From my house, all you had to do was traverse the garden, hop a chest-high fence, then you’d find yourself in the forest. And already Maggie had disappeared into the thicket.

My pulse shot into the stratosphere—a fast-moving river cut through those woods, she could have slipped into the embankment and gotten swept away. I followed the screams, shouting “MAGGIE,” so loud my throat turned raw.

Eventually, I came upon Dylan laying in a soft bed of grass. My attention was so focused on him Maggie got the jump on me.

I remember her entire weight against my stomach, her cold hands fumbling along my face, one of her filthy fingernails scraping my right eye. Beside us, Dylan’s signed furiously, his eyes shiny with tears. *I’m done, Mad Maggie, I’m done.*

I don’t even remember picking up that damn rock. I just remember the rage in my stomach—that fierce desire to protect my baby. Everything else is a blur.

Lying flat on her back, Maggie’s upper teeth were gone, both her eyes had swollen shut, and her nose pointed sideways. After checking on Dylan, I put my hands under Maggie’s armpits and lifted her, then, grunting from the effort, I dragged her bloody corpse over to the river and tossed her in. The current immediately swept her away.

Despite acting in self-defence, I kept the encounter to myself. The police had been zero help, and hell, they’d even defended Maggie on multiple occasions. *Why not steer clear of those shops from now on?* Say they did take my side, there’d still be endless questions, investigations.

No. Unacceptable. Dylan needed me.

Back home, he had Maggie’s horrible stench all over him. It was the stink of someone who hadn’t showered since Watergate. The sour odor wouldn’t wash out—even after a hot bath, me scrubbing him well beyond the point he wanted to get out. *I’m done, I’m done, I’m done.*

But her scent had seeped into his skin and hair. It took three hours to get him clean.

A week later, the police show up at my door. Turned out a group of teenagers found Maggie snagged on an exposed tree root a half-mile downstream, her wicked face infested with midges and maggots. I told them I hadn’t seen her for weeks, which they seemed to buy, and hoped that was the end of the whole horrible ordeal.

But soon, odd things started happening around the house. While making breakfast, I’d hear a wooden cupboard slam somewhere upstairs. When I nipped to the bathroom, metal frying pans clattered loudly against the kitchen floor. And in the evenings, despite blasting the heater, the temperature would plummet five, maybe even six degrees, to the point me and Dylan’s breaths misted up.

Then one night, while I lay in bed, my son just across the hall, the whole house turned ghost quiet. The only sound was a car engine in the far distance, quickly growing fainter.

A peculiar stench wafted into the room, then the darkness of the house seemed to thicken. It reminded me of being a little girl, too scared to go to the bathroom alone on those cold, winter nights.

As I pulled a robe over my shoulders, this intense feeling of dread filled the pit of my stomach. My maternal instincts screamed: hurry, your baby needs you.

With every upstairs light on, I rushed into Dylan’s bedroom and checked his cot, before scanning my eyes across the room. There was this unbearable sense of *presence*, one much too strong to be my imagination.

Dylan woke up and began to cry. As I whipped my head toward him, this eerie shadow seemed to appear. It hovered above him, around him, threatening to engulf him.

The very instant I scooped him up into my arms, a nearby shelf collapsed, sending stuffed animals scattering across the floor. On the sidewall, the glass frame covering a photo of us down by the beach exploded. The loud sound made him scream his tiny guts out.

I stood bolt upright, eyes wide, and saw something move in the corner of the room—a shadow that seemed to grow. And with that, my son’s solitary scream became a duet.

In a desperate bid for safety I rushed down the stairs, but halfway toward the front door a pale face filled the side window and I spun on my heels, toward the kitchen. At the far end of a hall, the entrance slammed shut, seemingly by itself, leaving nowhere to go besides the storage unit under the stairs.

Still holding Dylan, I dived into the cramped space and pulled the door shut. I set him down facing me, whispering that everything would be okay—that mommy was right here.

The only light came from my phone. Squinting against the brightness, pinched between a mop and a musty box of DVDs, Dylan sat up and raised his arms into an X, rapidly signing *I’m done, I’m done, I’m done.*

Just then, an evil chill rose up over my shoulders, spread across my back, and slithered toward the soles of my feet, lower and lower. Giant beads of sweat rolled down my forehead as a moist sickness forced its way up into my throat.

I felt something along the back of my neck: a heavy breath, warm and pungent, with a familiar, sour stench. And then, as if to confirm my deepest fears, my son looked up over my shoulder, *past* my shoulder, and signed something new. *Mad Maggie, I'm done, Mad Maggie, I'm done, Mad Maggie*, *Mad Maggie, Mad Maggie.*

And once again, I found myself powerless to do anything besides gaze into his beautiful, shiny eyes, wishing I could make it all go away.

Now we’re trapped here. Maggie’s still behind me, her icy fingers reaching out to touch my throat, and the instant I turn around I know she’ll be there, a viper ready to strike.

So if you’re searching for a fun way to bond with your child, a way to help speed up their speech development, and think teaching them sign language sounds like a fun idea you’d like to explore, do yourself a gigantic favour…

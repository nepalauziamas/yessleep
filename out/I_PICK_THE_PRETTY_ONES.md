There she was was the little girl that lived alone under a bridge. She was about 10years old with no one to care for her to love her or to even be there for her.
The girl was always sad and would just hate life every morning when she woke up and every night when she was getting ready to sleep.

Life was tough she told herself and kept contemplating whether it was worth all the suffering,all the pain and all the misery.

She always saw people walking up and down and around the bridge,some were couples, some were families,some were friends and others had pets. She started thinking more and asking herself why she was alone and what horrible crime she must have committed in her past life to be punished like this.

One night while she was under her bridge,under her cardboard that she uses as a blanket in the cold harsh weather, she felt someone's footsteps and rustling on top of the bridge. She couldn't see the person but she was shocked as usually at this time the bridge was deserted and she was the only one there. 

She kept quiet and listened but then everything was silent again, she thought maybe it was her imagination maybe the cold was playing tricks on her so she snuggled under her cardboard and started to fall asleep, just as she was about to drift away completely she felt something, something heavy on top of her she opened her eyes and saw something that she couldn't quite describe it still groggy from the sleep.

 Was it human? Was it an animal? Was it a man? Was it a woman?. The "thing" was covered in black from top to bottom and when she looked closer she saw hands and realized it was human, relief washed over her and she tried to ask this person whether they didn't see her, she was very petite and slender from eating leftovers in trash and since she was under a big cardboard she thought maybe this person didn't see her. The person on top of her had a shiny thing in their hands she saw it glistening under the moonlight.

 Her eyes grew wide and she knew at that moment her questions would be answered, they had a knife. She told the person the only thing I have is my life, do you want to take it as well? But no response, a million scenarios suddenly rushed in her mind and then slowly she feel back to her cardboard bed and released the breath she was holding. 

The person on top of her was shocked at how relaxed she became and felt sudden rage, they do this because they want to be feared and they do it for the rush they feel from over powering people but this girl, this petite dirty but beautiful little girl knew what was about to happen yet didn't react at all, it was as if killing her was going to release her of her burdens and that was exactly what she was feeling, among the million thoughts was "would it be soo bad if u died? You have nothing and you gave nothing, dying will be good for you".

she had accepted it and the person although angry at her response to the whole thing thought they had to go through since they committed. They had been stalking her for days and it was too late to back out now even thou it wasn't much fun, and in one swift move they brought down the knife quickly into her heart and she gurgled and her body twitched a few times then she went limp.

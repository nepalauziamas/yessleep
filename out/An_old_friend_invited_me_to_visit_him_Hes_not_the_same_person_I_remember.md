I haven’t lived in my hometown for about ten years, and hadn’t spoken to anyone from there in about seven, so I was fairly surprised yesterday when my old friend Trent called and asked if I’d want to visit his parents with him. Having nothing better to do with my weekend—which isn’t exactly unusual, these days—I agreed, admittedly excited to see how he had turned out.  

My parents, following my graduation from college, had moved away from the town, so Trent and his family were the only people left there whom I had any real connection to. I was just going to stop by, have dinner, hangout for a while, and then head back home; having no place to sleep, and not wanting to impose upon their hospitality by spending the night. Trent had been a close friend in childhood, but we hadn’t spoken in years, and I didn’t think he’d want to spend too much time with someone who had essentially become a stranger. 

I arrived at the house just around 6pm, and noticed how it hadn’t changed much despite the decade that had passed. A new arrangement of flowers here, some chipped paint there, but it was otherwise the same house I’d gone to after school nearly every day as a kid. Trent had already arrived, his car parked in the driveway. He’d mentioned the car in his phone call, among a few other minor details, another of which being the fact that he hadn’t spoken to anyone else from the town in years, either. It was really a family reunion, more than anything, and I appreciated him inviting me along; knowing I didn’t have any family in the area.  

I crossed the yard and knocked, and only then cringed inwardly at remembering how I'd often been chastised by Trent’s dad about trudging arose the yard. A habit I still (unfortunately) hadn’t yet broken. Trent answered, and even though he had grown fully into adulthood, I still recognized my old friend—in the eyes, more than anything. They were aglow with characteristic mirth, as if he had a dumb joke or two he was just dying to share. We hugged, and he welcomed me in.  

Like the exterior, the interior of the house hadn’t changed much, and neither had his parents; they were still the same couple I remembered, with only a subtle greyness in their hair to indicate that time had passed. I hugged them too, and we sat in the living room chatting for a while; catching up on all the usual happenings of life. Afterwards, we all went into the kitchen, where Trent’s mom had prepared dinner before my arrival. She and Trent’s father served everyone, a nice meal of pot roast, with French bread and coffee; lemon cake for dessert. Trent seemed happy, and, as I’d expected, rattled off a few groan-inducing jokes. We were all having a nice time, until... 

Without warning, snarling as if suddenly and totally possessed by some feral demon, Trent’s once-kindly mother then sprang up from her chair and leapt headlong across the table—at me. 

Before I could react, her head slammed into my chest, propelling me backwards in my chair. Thankfully, I’d had enough sense to hold onto the seat; otherwise, I’m sure I would’ve cracked my skull on the kitchen floor. Trent’s mom landed atop me; her now froth-smeared face twisted into an expression of semi-bestial rage. Even as Trent called his mother’s name, imploring her to stop, she gripped my throat and throttled me; all the while frothing at the mouth and growling, like some rabies-addled lunatic 

Panic rising, I struggled with her, first trying to unlatch her claw-like hands from my throat; and then, upon failing at at this, tried to knock her aside. But she continued, despite my best efforts, to immovably straddle me, and the world quickly grew dim as my lungs fought a losing battle to breathe. Meanwhile, Trent and his father shouted at her, but their voices were drowned out by the insane, almost monstrous growling... 

Just when I thought I’d die, viciously strangled on the kitchen floor by an insane woman, the excruciating pressure around my throat was relieved, and the redness that had clouded my vision receded a little. Peering to my right—where I had noticed, through my visual murk, two figures in motion—I saw Trent’s mom being dragged away by his father; kicking and snarling and snapping her jaws, like a wildly frenzied animal. Despite this horrific behavior, Trent’s father pulled her into the living room solemnly; as if he had, from previous dealings, grown darkly accustomed to the woman’s nearly inhuman hysteria.  

Meanwhile Trent stood before his place at the table, eyes averted downward, tears falling freely to land on his half-finished dessert.  

I remained on the floor for a moment, stunned and still recovering from my near-death experience. After a while, I heard a series of distant, metallic sounds---what sounded like locks or mechanisms of some kind being fashioned together—issue from somewhere in the living room, and then Trent’s dad returned to the kitchen, his shirt missing a few buttons and stained with sweat. He looked at Trent apologetically, and then to me; and like a host hurrying to take a newly arrived guest’s coat, he rushed over to me and extended a strong-looking arm—apologizing as he effortlessly hefted me to my feet. 

I leaned against the table for support, and he offered me a glass of water—the only one that hadn’t been knocked over by his wife’s table-crossing dive. I wasn’t sure whose it was, but different care; my throat burned awfully, and I felt as if I hadn’t had a drink of anything in years.  

“I’m so sorry. My wife is slowly losing her mind. She’s dying.”  

Trent’s Dad stared off, ashamed of what his wife had done—had *tried* to do. Even though I could barely breathe, with my throat still burning, I offered my own apology for his wife’s condition. But then, in a moment of even greater surprise, he said, “I am, too. We both are. And...” For a brief moment his gaze then shifted, almost imperceptibly, toward Trent.  

Still standing on the other side of the table, Trent looked away, his face streaked with tears. HIs father quietly left the kitchen, presumably to go check on Trent’s mom and give us a moment. Confused, I asked Trent what was wrong (beyond the obvious) and, wiping away his tears, he motioned for me to follow him. I stepped around the ruined table, nearly slipping on the food and dishes that had been spilled, and followed Trent from the kitchen into the hall that led toward the bedrooms. But instead of going into any of the rooms off the hall, Trent stopped at the very end, and began pushing against the surface of the wall there.  

Applying pressure between two candle fixtures I had never once seen lit, he pressed against the wall with all his might, and it eventually, miraculously gave way; a rectangular indentation the height of a man suddenly appearing and then sliding upwards into the ceiling. I marveled at the incredible sight; it was like something out of a mystery film. But in the brief moment during which Trent turned back to see that I was still behind him, he looked absolutely depressed, and I curbed my excitement.  

The newly opened space led into a tight corridor, lightless and dust-choked. I tried to bring up a mental image of the house’s layout, and was certain that, ordinarily, the side-yard was just a few feet beyond the wall. And yet here was some kind of secret passageway which shouldn’t, couldn't’ t exist; one that subtly led down toward some subterranean depth. Undeterred, Trent continued on, plunging blindly into the dark tunnel. Not wanting to linger in the entrance with his rabid mother somewhere in the house, I followed.  

We walked in dark silence for a while, maybe two or minutes, and during our journey my shock only mounted; I knew, with each step, that I was venturing further into some ultra-secret realm, some place that somehow abided by its own geographical rules. And though I couldn’t see his face, I sensed the progressive darkening of Trent’s already somber mood; could tell, by his body language and quietude, that he was leading me to something dreadful—a revelation of some kind that hurt him deeply.  

Finally, we reached an open space, cavernous in its expansiveness, abyssal in the upward depth of its darkness. I reeled; my mind unable to reconcile the massive, darkly sprawling space with what I knew of the aboveground area. It simply couldn’t exist. But Trent caught me before I could teeter and fall, and led me ahead, toward *something.*  

As we drew nearer to our destination, I started to sense a presence of some kind—a thing I knew, almost at once, was an entity; but one of a biological order entirely different from ours. Trent stayed silent, though his features did eventually change; becoming less pained over time, more relaxed, but the expression still markedly grim. The darkness, despite already being pitch-black, continued to deepen, but in the moment, I didn’t bother wondering how I was still able to see Trent; my mind already clogged by dozens of other questions. I had accepted the impossible underground space; I could accept my momentarily preternatural sight. 

Eventually we stopped, and Trent tentatively let me go. I nodded my head, indicating that I could stand on my own, and he took a few steps ahead. It was then that I noticed a thing, *a massive T*hing, standing before us—though “standing” probably isn’t the most acurate word. It towered above us on two huge, tree-like legs, though there were others; these appearing gnarled and almost shadowy to my dark-shaded vision. A torso or trunk of some kind rested on the legs, and its oddly proportioned bulk was covered by moss, or a greyish mottling of some kind, and I got the impression that it—whatever it was—hadn't moved in centuries, if not longer. Long, hand-less limbs depended from the trunk, in a seemingly random arrangement; and these, like the gnarled legs, were weirdly bent and contorted; many blurring the lines between tentacle and branches.  

I couldn’t see the head, owed mostly to the thing’s titantic height; its topmost portions were obscured by the ceilingward gloom. But I sensed that something was looking down on me, a set of greatly inhuman eyes—an intelligence beyond anything humanly conceivable.... 

Trent went up to the thing and stood by it, as a child my by a parent upon being called. Even more confused---and more than a little frightened—I asked, stuttering, what was going on. A voice then began to respond, but *not* Trent’s. Looking up, I realized that the voice was coming from above, from the bizarre Tree-Thing.  

“I’m sorry that things have become so...frightening, but there’s no other way to show you than this. *I* am Trent. I am Trent’s parents. They are vessels of my being—sproutings of my form. I have been here for so very long, but unlike others of my kind, I never had any intention of harming humanity. So, I integrated myself here, created this habitable pocket of space for myself within the bowels of your planet, and grew in secret. When man settled this place, I assimilated into their society, sprouted members of my own to join the people and live among them—among you.”  

The voice, slow and thoughtful and infinitely deep, spoke to me as a dying person might to a distraught loved one; attempting to calm their unrest with soothing tones. Meanwhile, Trent still stood impassively beside it, as if mentally distracted—spiritually dormant.  

“But despite what assumptions you may have come to regarding the nature of my existence, I too age, and have grown considerably old—much older than any of my kind—all of whom are now dead. And my time is ending, I am deteriorating, quite rapidly, and so too are my progeny.” Weakly, one of the limbs gestured toward Trent, who then mustered a despondent smile.  

It continued:  

“In their degeneration, they’ve grown insane. You’ve seen once such example of his lunacy yourself. The mother isn’t the only one whose felt it; they all have exhibited such behavior, at one time or another in the last few weeks. I thought it would be best to see you one last time, while I still could; before my advanced agedness takes me. I have missed you, my friend; I missed you so much.”  

It was all so unbelievably incredible, so darkly fantastical, that I just stood there, speechless, staring up at this gigantic (and allegedly alien) growth. I felt a wave of sudden sadness emanate from the thing, and my mind instinctively prepared itself for some final, immensely depressing revelation.  

“I am sorry for having deceived you all these years, but what other choice did I have? I existed, behaved, *lived* as a human, interacted with you and others as any family would’ve. I laughed, cried, became angered and saddened by all the things that would’ve elicited those same emotions in you. I was, in my own, unusual way, human. And you, in *every* way, were my friend.”  

The body then shuddered, as if a chill or tremor had run through it. Trent also underwent a similar spasm, and then tottered forward. Before I could move to catch him, he landed, face-first, onto the rocky ground, and in a moment of appalling unreality his body collapsed; disintegrating upon contact. Scattered bits of.... earth was all that remained of my friend, and many of these pieces then succumbed to an even further disintegration of their own, becoming virtually invisible. Trent, clothes and bones and all, had vanished.  

“It is time. I am entering my final stage of death. Thank you for everything. Goodbye, my friend.”  

Before my eyes, the thing—my friend—succumbed to the same rapid destruction that had assailed Trent’s body. The appendages drooped and withered; the once hulking body sank and deflated; the odd assortment of legs—already weakened and diminished by age—then collapsed, unable to support even the increasingly hollow form above them. The whole structure of the body imploded, and then, just as Trent had, crumbled away to dust and debris on the ground. After only seconds, all that remained was a pile desiccated earth, a grey mound of dissolution.  

Using some loose stones I had gathered from nearby, I then built a make-shift cairn before the pile, knowing that some errant breeze from above would someday sweep the remains away. The ground was solid rock, I knew I wouldn’t be able to bury the ash-like substance, and it would’ve felt improper to take them elsewhere. The cavern, impossibly isolated, had been the entity’s home for countless years.  

I returned upstairs to find the mother and father in similar states, mere piles, indistinguishably intermingled amidst a collection of chains in the living room. I gathered them as best as I could and brought them down to the cave, and laid them to rest beside the large pile and Trent’s. I then returned to the house, and after some trial-and-error, managed to close the secret door in the wall; sealing off the corridor and the tomb beyond.  

That’s the end of my story, of Trent and his “family”. I’m still not quite sure how I feel about it all; terrifying images still linger in my mind, flashes of the mother’s murderously hysterical state, vague suggestions of the Thing’s potentially nightmarish face, which had been almost entirely concealed from view; perhaps intentionally... 

I do know that I’ve lost a friend, my oldest pal, and will mourn him as I would any other friend.

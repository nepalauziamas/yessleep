Disney is a place where dreams come true. The happiest place on Earth. Nothing bad ever happens…ever. 

Pepper sat in an interrogation room as disney security guarded the door. “Do we know how long this is going to take?” Pepper's leg bounced as she stared at unnervingly happy guards. Did they not know what happened?

Pepper had worked for disney since she turned 17. It had been her dream when she was a kid. Everyone wanted to spend their day working at the happiest place on Earth. As she grew her roles changed, she remembered flying as tinkerbell, being the face of the snow white, playing a masked character, even the less exciting janitorial jobs she had at the beginning.

Disney was a hard company to work for, without a doubt, but it came with its perks. She didn’t realize that it also had its downs. Screw ups happen, it's inevitable in any workplace, but this was the happiest place on Earth.

“Don’t worry. For you, it will only take a few minutes, and the rest will be taken care of.” Pepper’s stomach dropped. “Do you know what happened?” Pepper shook her head, there’s no way, nobody would smile knowing what happened to that poor boy.

“Nothing happened. What do you mean?” The other guard spoke, his smile still soft, though his eyes shot her a warning glare. Gesturing for her to sit back down. She hadn’t realized she’d begun standing.

Pepper looked down at her clothes, the splotches of blood had just begun drying, but the images of a boy who was much too small for a ride had stuck in her head. She could see images of it everytime she closed her eyes. 

The way he slipped through the safety bars.

The way he caught himself on the tracks.

How the ride didn’t stop cutting his hands from his arms,

and his head from his neck.

He didn’t even have enough time to scream.

She saw the on site EMTs come in and start CPR, because this was Disney and nobody dies at disney.

Pepper was filled with anger and confusion in an instant, “Will you stop smiling? A child is dead! I saw his head fly off!”

A door opened behind her and a man in a Mickey Mouse costume stepped out. Pepper grit her teeth. “Are you kidding me? Can anyone take this seriously?”

“Tsk, Tsk, Tsk. We had such high hopes for you.” Pepper couldn’t place the voice, it sounded familiar, maybe a previous boss, she couldn’t tell.

“Look, can everyone just drop the act? I’m tired.” Pepper looked at the ceiling with exhaustion.

The man in costume sighed, ignoring her? “Come here, Pepper.” 

She stood and made her way over to him. “Do you know the mantra of our brand?”

“Entertainment with Heart?” Pepper raised an eyebrow as he nodded and placed his left hand over her heart. If she was in any normal state of mind, she would have considered this a trip to HR.

“That’s right. We put our heart into everything here.” The mouse moved his hand to her shoulder pulling her in for a hug.

Pepper let out a sharp exhale, eyes going wide as she pushed him away looking down at the knife now sticking out of  her chest.

“If you aren’t going to use yours you have no need for it.” He pulled the knife out and she fell to her knees. He smiled down at her.

“C’mon give us a smile, afterall, Disney is a place where dreams come true. It’s the happiest place on Earth.” And nothing bad ever happens… ever.

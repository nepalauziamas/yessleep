Hey so I’m new to Reddit, so I’m not sure if this is where I should be posting this, but I’ve seen a lot of similar pop ups on the internet leading back to this thread of posts, so I’m going to try my luck with it. 

So background …for a few years now I’ve been living in this rented mobile home due to my parents divorcing when I was in elementary school. My mom found this place and we moved in as I entered the 5th grade. I didn’t really have an issue with moving since the old home we lived in had worse experiences, and by that I mean I would see things, hear things, and feel things. I would get sleep paralysis and I would dream about, myself ?? Not so much myself but my dream would be of me sleeping in my bed, but the weird part is it would be from an above perspective, as if someone was watching me sleep from above ? I don’t know how to explain it so I hope you all understand, anyways …things like that always happened and I would always be scared and have a feeling of dread in my stomach, both during the day and night, I would feel like if I wasn’t alone or safe, and I only realized it was a problem when I would still get the feeling of dread when I was with family in my home, either way I just wanted to let you all know what experiences I’ve had and let you know that this isn’t my first time and that I am familiarized with these things happening. 

So my first incident isn’t anything out of the ordinary that I would feel or experience, but it still made me uneasy nonetheless since it was a feeling I grew to hate over a long period of time (mainly my entire childhood). I felt like I was being watched from one specific room of the house and it’s currently the room I sleep in and where I am typing this from now. It’s considered the master bedroom since there is a bathroom and closet in here. Anyways ….when I’m in bed I feel like I’m not safe, I feel like there is something in the darkness of the bathroom, and because of that feeling I’ve come to a habit of having all the doors closed because just seeing the darkness makes me wary, and like something is waiting for me. My mom however doesn’t have this habit, she leaves the doors cracked open enough to where you can see the bathtub and the counter, so I always have to get up and close the door all the way for her because when I look in, no matter how sunny it is in the room, the bathroom will always be darker, like no sign of light inside at all, even when the door is cracked open, which again it is cracked wide enough to see the whole bathtub and starting  of the counter, so you would expect it to get somewhat lighter inside, but no it’s pitch black. 

Keeping this in mind, we’re gonna go back to when I spent my first night in here. So for the layout, my bed is in the right corner of my room right in-front of my closet and my bathroom is kinda to the left of my bed right next to my closet. so it’s morning and I’m waking up from sleep, still kind of in that awake but still sleeping state of mind and I have my eyes a bit squinted because on my far left is this big window letting In the most ungodly amount of sunlight, but anyways I’m in bed and I look down to the left foot side of my bed, and remember I always close the doors all the way, so you can imagine the feeling of dread that came over me when I looked down at the foot of my bed only to see the bathroom door open and continue to open to a similar sized crack my mom leaves when closing the door behind her. In that moment I didn’t know what to do, I just stayed staring into the pitch black room, into the darkness, feeling that horrible familiar sensation of being watched. I didn’t move, I didn’t say anything, I didn’t even breathe, I just closed my eyes and turned my head the other way and fell back asleep. Once I woke up i saw the bathroom door open a bit wider, but during that time I considered it as normal since the time I woke up was when my little sister was awake so I expected her to come use the bathroom, but as I fully woke up and I saw the more opened bathroom door I just got up, grabbed my phone and left the room. 

I still don’t know what to make of that, I tell myself it was the draft from the air vent in the floor due to ac turning on since it’s summer, but I woke up drenched in sweat, so it clearly wasn’t that …anyways this post is getting long, so I’ll probably post more about my experiences so I can get some help in figuring out what is in my home, cause believe me there are a few more incidents. signing off for today, and please tell me any theories or thoughts on what it was cause I really want a solution to that, thanks.

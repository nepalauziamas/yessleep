Disclaimer "LONG STORY".

I had a friend , who was never a believer. Anytime something spooky would happen he would just disregard it as wind or coincidence. I even recall one time we were hanging out in a construction zone just chilling and we heard, what seemed to be a scream. We later investigated and no one was anywhere near the construction zone. Not to mention it was about 3am at the time, but he just said that someone tried to prank us.

On his 22nd birthday he decided to get himself a new house, to not live with his parents anymore. He didn't have that much money so the house was an hour drive from the city. House was pretty big for the money he paid , why he paid it that little we will soon find out.

He moved in normally, no disturbance in the process. I've helped him move most of the time, so I also saw the house first hand before he moved. It was clean, very tidy , maybe too much. All the furniture (that wasn't his) was really new, and yet the price of the house was really low. After he settled in we threw a party to celebrate. We invited our friends and family and it was a lovely night to say the least.

After the party when we cleaned it all up (I was staying for the night there), I went to the bathroom to piss. Upon entering the bathroom I was hit with this smell, It didn't smell like something you expect in the toilet (urine or stool), only after few seconds I realized what the smell is. It was blood , I searched the whole bathroom but no signs of blood. After I had no explanation for the smell I just thought someone at the party had a bleeding nose and just flushed the paper that he used to stop the bleeding down the toilet, somehow smell was still in the air.

In the morning I forgot all about the smell, but as soon as I woke up I noticed that my friend was missing. I thought he was probably making breakfast or something. I headed to the bathroom to preform the morning routine. When I went in I saw my friend bent over the sink bleeding all over it. I rushed to him to see what's happening . "Ahhh, it's nothing, just a nose bleed" he said and looked to the mirror , the blood seemed to have stopped. I yet again felt the smell of the blood , but this time I had a reason for it. The rest of the day went normally and I returned home.

I went to sleep and had the weirdest dream ever. I was in the bathroom taking a piss while my friend was at the same time trying to stop the bleeding, but at certain point it got so messy that he fell to the floor. I could see it, but in the dream I wasn't doing anything. I just kept pissing and asking myself why do I smell blood. I woke up in sweat, but realizing how stupid of a dream that was I just turned on the other side of the bed and went back to sleep.

Nothing much happened at first, I've been at his place few times since that day and nothing out of the ordinary happened at all, until one day. My friend and I decided to have a double date at his place. I invited my girlfriend and he invited his. We were watching the movies when my friends girlfriend (for the sake of keeping it simple , we will call her Chloe) went to the bathroom. After few minutes we heard her say "yes I would like a glass of wine, bring it to the living room". She came in to the room sat back on the couch next to my friend and all surprised said "I didn't know this house came with butlers" she said and laughed. My friend looked at her confused and then he looked at me.

"What do you mean butlers ?" I asked Chloe. " Oh the old guy that looks like he is from 1940" she said and since we didn't answer anything she continued "he asked if I wanted a drink, so I said wine is alright". We all kept silent for few seconds then I managed to speak finally "There is no butler from 1940 here". She looked me and almost laughed thinking I was joking, but when she saw the straight and worried face we all had she just asked "So we have an intruder in the house?". As soon as she said that we heard something fall in the kitchen. Me and my friend looked at each other and because I knew where his weapons are, I grabbed guns from the bottom of the couch I was sitting on and gave him one, keeping one to myself. We started walking slowly to the kitchen turning the lights as we went to the kitchen . The kitchen was on the other side of the house , the whole time we had our guns raised.

We searched the whole kitchen, and after that the whole house and no one was there. Not even signs of movement or anything. Strangely enough the thing that fell in the kitchen was a wine glass , and somehow the wine bottle that was on top of the countertop usually, was on the table. We called the police soon after just to make sure. They searched the house as well and didn't find any signs of intrusion. When they were leaving the older police officer said to my friend with a chuckle "You really didn't know what you were going in to ?" . My friend just awkwardly smiled.

We all agreed to just sleep over at his place. Me and my girlfriend got the guests bedroom, which was closer to the bathroom, so every time one of them got up to go to the bathroom I would be woken up. Being a light sleeper and my friend and his girlfriend drinking a bit before going to bed, that happened allot that night. One time in particular I got woken up because someone called my name , thinking it was either my friend or Chloe, or even my girlfriend (lets call her Jessica). I looked to the door since I felt Jessica sleeping beside me and there was someone crouching there. At first I thought it was either my friend or his girlfriend wanting a ride to the ambulance because they got drunk.

"yes?" I replied , but no more words were said. As my eyes started adapting to the light I realized the thing that was crouching wasn't my friend or Chloe, it couldn't me Jessica either, since I could hear here breath behind me. The thing wasn't even human, it had fur instead of skin, it was disgusting to look at. I was frozen in fear so I just kept looking at it. The more I looked, the more I saw. It had distorted body features. It's arms were normal size, but its hands were bigger than they should be.

I wasn't able to move from the fear, at one point I thought either Jimmy( my friend) or Chloe were trying to prank me , but this was too realistic to be a costume or makeup. All of a sudden I heard footsteps behind the creature and the door opened, I got blinded for a second from the light. I managed to focus my eyes to whoever opened the door, it was Jessica. "why aren't you sleeping?" she asked, the weird thing that was crouching at the door was gone, but then it hit me.

If Jessica just came in, who is constantly breathing behind me ? I jerked around and there was no one besides me. I couldn't sleep well that night, always had nightmares of the creature at the door, or tried to figure out who was besides me in the bed earlier. In the morning I left with Jessica and told her all about the encounters last night, she is also a paranormal believer so she trusted me. Then she told me  something weird as well. While she was in the bathroom she felt this smell of blood constantly, I told her that I felt it too and we didn't talk about it anymore. My friend wasn't that active the next couple of days, saw him on my way from work , he was carrying something wrapped in a paper bag and looked to be in a hurry.

When I asked him what was in the bag he kind off ignored the question and asked me to if I could come to his house for the weekend, After I said I would he smiled and went off in a rush. It was Friday evening, since I didn't get any text from Jimmy I thought he meant for me to come on Saturday. Eventually he called me. "Can you come right now?" he asked with a crack in his voice. " Yeah I can be there soon enough" I said. "Do I bring anything?" I asked, " No , just get here, as soon as possible" he said and hung up again in a hurry

I rushed there as he told me to, when I parked the car in front of the house I saw him on the window just looking at me. He looked worried, and pale, he was just standing there not moving. I waved to him and smiled but he didn't move, like he was frozen. I came to the door and rang, he was still on the window I waved once again, and at that time the door opened. I thought maybe it was his girlfriend that opened the door so I look around and.... I was facing a gun barrel.

I jumped, "what the fuck" I yelled. "Oh it is you" Jimmy said and lowered the gun , he looked to not be worried by the fact that he pointed a gun at me "Get in" he just said. I was still shaken from the incident , but just shrugged it of and went in. "why did you point a gun at me?" I asked when I entered the living room. "I didn't think its you" he just said and like he was in a rush just made me a place so I can sit on the couch , then I realized that his whole room was dirty. "What happened here" I asked "Why aren't you cleaning your room" he just kept quite. "wanna drink something" he asked me. "Sure I could drink a beer" I replied.

I then remembered that he couldn't be at the window and at the door at the same time, so while he was getting me a drink from the kitchen I went to the room where I saw him when I came to the house. First I thought I won't find anything, but my expectations were ruined. I went in to the room, and there he was, just sitting on the couch with his head between his knees rocking back and forth , muttering something to himself. 

I got confused cuz I just saw him went to the kitchen and this room was on the opposite side of the house. I couldn't think much cuz all of a sudden he spoke "did he let you in?" he asked. I didn't know what to answer so I just asked who, he chuckled "the guy that looks just like me?". Suddenly I heard loud footsteps behind me running, my instincts made me run in to the room and close it behind me locking the door. "You can't run from him" Jimmy said in almost a frantic voice "he will find a way in, he always does". I just pushed on the door, because whoever was behind it kept banging at the door.

"Who is he" I asked jimmy "Why the fuck would I know?" he yelled and laughed at the same time "this all started happening after she told me to hide". On the word "she" he nodded his head to the corner of the room , but there was no one there. I was confused at the time and realized only few seconds after, that the banging on the door has stopped. "He is going to com in now, you cant hide , I tried , I know" he said and then went in to a sort of panic attack just repeating the words "I've tried, yes , yes, I have tried, but that whore got what she deserved, She should have known better, I tried, yes, I tried".

I decided to open the door to take a look at what was out there. I opened the door just a little, and the hallway was empty. "Hey, you there?" I've heard Jimmy's voice , and I again got confused, because It didn't come from the Jimmy behind me. I looked behind me and there was no one there, I got this weird feeling and just bolted out of the room , didn't stop to think what has happened. I went in the the living room and there he was again, only this time it was the normal Jimmy. I saw that he brought me a beer as I've asked of him , and all of a sudden the whole room was clean. 

"For how long was I gone?" I asked. He had a confused look on his face "For like 20 seconds, maybe less , where did you go even?" he replied. That seemed longer than 20 seconds , and he couldn't have cleaned the whole room in that time. I told him about what happened and he just got more confused along the way. "So you saw me , but as a lunatic?" he jokingly asked. "I don't know what I saw" I replied "maybe I'm the lunatic here" I said jokingly but at the time I had feared it was just in my head. 

" I don't know bro" he just said with a sigh " weird stuff did start happening here lately" he said. I asked him what he was talking about. "Well the other day, I somehow saw you in my living room making out with Chloe" he said out of the blue. "I knew you were at work and she was at college, but I saw you two clear as day, and heck, why would the two of you even make out". He told me it vanished after he took a better look so he just disregarded it thinking he was tired. I asked him where Chloe was, to try and change the subject. " I don't really know, she didn't reply to me since yesterday, I thought of going to her place tomorrow morning, I'm starting to get worried" He said. 

The evening went fine enough, he showed me to my bed, the same bed I slept in with Jessica earlier that week, and then remembered the things that happened that night. I was too exhausted to think of it for too long and just feel a sleep. Sometimes after 3AM I got woken up by a loud bang , I didn't know where it came from, but then I felt two hands shaking me on my shoulders. "wake up" I heard Jessica's voice, "wake up". So I jumped from my bed and there was no one in the room with me, not even Jessica who I thought was the one to wake me up. Why I thought she would even be there, I don't know. 

I heard another bang, this one a bit more quite, with caution I left the room. The sound was coming from the kitchen so that's where I went . It was Jimmy, he was banging his head against the fridge. "Get out" I've heard him whisper, "get out of my body". I ran to him and pulled him away from the fridge. "No, what are you doing" he asked me, blood was dripping from his head, "I have to kill him, he is in me" he said and with allot more force than he usually had, resisted me and went running his head first to the fridge yet again. This one sent him on his back, he tried to get up again but it seems this hit was a bit too far. "I don't know what the fuck you are talking about but I'm leaving" I suddenly snapped. I didn't want to be there anymore, the place felt weird and Jimmy was acting like a lunatic. 

Jimmy started laughing, "don't you understand, you can't leave, he will follow you, they all are" and he got to his feet, but this time he took a kitchen knife. Before I could do anything he slit his throat right in front of my eyes, this froze me to my core. What the fuck am I to do. He fell to the floor twitching a bit and then stopped, the blood was all over the floor. I thought of calling 911 , but got scared they would think it was me. I just stood there frozen, until my phone rang, it was 3 in the morning so who could it be. "Yes" I answered , "Bro are you making these sounds?" I've heard Jimmy's voice over the phone. At the time I thought I was losing my marbles . I look to the floor where Jimmy took his life, but the body wasn't there. "Where are you?" I asked. "I'm in my bed, just wanted to see if it was you that was making the banging sound, at some point it sounded like someone was dying.

Later he came out of the room and I told him what I've seen, he looked worried but didn't say much. As usual he was acting all sceptic abut all of that. All of a sudden I got a phone call again, it was Chloe It caught me off guard so I answered normally. "yes?" I heard a scream at first but then realized its something wrong with the line , at some point it got more quite . "Don't talk to him, that's not the real him, run". I looked at Jimmy and it didn't seem like him at all. I don't know what felt off about him but it did. I bolted out of the room "she really crossed the line now" I've heard him say and again, fast paced footsteps were behind me. I looked for a second over my shoulder and just got motivation to run faster.

It wasn't Jimmy anymore, but something that looked like it came from a horror movie. Rotten flesh and glowing red eyes, It walked on all four and was really fast. I came out of the house and went to my car, shit, it wont start, I'm just gonna run for it. I was almost down the street when I remembered the real Jimmy was still there. I hesitated but then turned back. When I came back everything looked normal. But then my vision started "glitching" , I can't explain the feeling but it was something like waking up from a dream and the image of the dream being over the what you actually see. I saw fire, but the house wasn't burning, or the house that I saw wasn't at least, I then completely snapped out of it and the house was on fire, It was so bright I had to cover my eyes.

"I had to do it" I've heard a voice say, it was Jimmy "I had to burn it" he cried. "They took her from me, they took her from me" he started screaming. I looked at him he was all covered in blood, I don't know whose but it was blood. I've seen the police lights in the distance. Someone called them, they immediately put us in handcuffs. At the trial it has been determined Jimmy killed his girlfriend and burned the house, the reason I wasn't investigated is because I actually never went to the house that day. From the police report they've seen me arrive with my car the moment they parked as well. 

Jimmy is now in a mental hospital, he was diagnosed with schizophrenia, multiple personality disorder, and all sorts of mental disorders. I still visit him sometimes even after 12 years, but at some point the visits were nothing more than to check that he is alive. At some point he lost touch to reality and when I would ask him he wouldn't answer like he didn't hear me. He usually just muttering stuff like "They took her from me" or "I had to burn it" or even "He is in, he fund the way in". Doctors told me he had a panic attack yelling "get him out of me" at some point. 

Jessica told me that , the night I "was" at my friends house she had a bad dream of me dying to the same thing I had seen in my vision chasing me out of the house. She said she felt large amount of fear and knew I was sleeping , she tried reaching me on the phone and at some point yelled "wake up" just like what I've heard when I had my vision/been in Jimmy's house and woken up to her voice.

After that I never seen or heard anything that looked or sounded like stuff that I saw in that house. I still to this day get chills from just thinking of that time, I'm not even sure if my friend is insane and actually responsible for the death of Chloe or if it was the strange activity around the house. I still try to find an explanation for that and only thing I can think of is parallel universes and demons.

I'm a 34 year old female, if that information even matters, but here's my story about the creepy things that have happened to me. For any of the recent stuff to make sense we have to rewind 25 years, back to when I was nine, and life was as perfect as could be. I was growing up in the country around my favorite grandpa who had a farm. I was a hyper child and many couldn't handle me but my Grandpa was the one I put on a pedestal. I was staying with my grandparents one night, along with my sister, when my grandpa had to leave to drive a box truck to a nearby county. My grandpa kissed all of his gals goodbye and proceeded to leave out of the back door. Nine year old me runs to the door after a few seconds and begs my grandpa not to leave because something bad was going to happen to him. He assured me that he would be fine and for me to go back inside to my grandma and sister. Fast forward to the next morning and my mom has picked me up, went home, and has went back to sleep while my sister stayed at my grandparents home with my grandma. Suddenly, the house phone rings and it's my grandma asking to speak to my mom, something doesn't sound okay. I take the cordless phone to my mom and sneak onto the other phone that I left off the hook so I could listen, and I hear my grandma tell my mom that the night before, my grandpa had a heart-attack in his semi after stopping at a gas station. 

Fast forward to when I was around 13-14ish and my mom takes me and my sister to a local rodeo. During the rodeo my sister and I are running around hanging out with our friends and having fun. My sisters friend had asked her to stay all night with her that night and mom tells her yes. The entire time I have this sinking feeling in my gut. Something doesn't feel right. When we leave the rodeo I'm voicing my concerns to my mom about how I feel like something isn't right with my sister and I ask if we can try to find her. This was pre cell phones so it wasn't like we could just ring her up and check on her. We spend the next 30 minutes or so stopping around places in town that she may have been and she's nowhere to be found. My mom tries to reassure me that my sister is okay and she's probably already made it to her friends home safe and sound. Mom and I go home and we see my dad speeding out of the driveway so we are alarmed and asked what was going on. My dad tells us that my sister is in the emergency room at our local hospital. My sister was walking across the road to get into the vehicle her friend and her were supposed to leave in when a toyota tacoma hit her while she was walking across. She was hospitalized for a short period of time with minor injuries.

I've always felt that after my sisters incident I blocked something out because I haven't had any gut feelings like that since. Until recently... now, 20 years later, I had one that has yet again, urked me to the core. My favorite cousin has this amazing girlfriend that I absolutely adore. She and her daughter have recently went through something that I just couldn't imagine ever having to go through. In this incident, a life was lost and nobody was letting anyone know where that person was. I had this voice in my head that just kept annoying me so I wrote my mother and sister and told them where I thought this person may be. Later, I drew a visual for them about what the area looked like that the person was at. A couple of days later the person was found at that exact location and in an area that matched the visual picture I drew. 

I'm not sure why I'm even writing all of this out because it sounds so insane but I'm so freaked out about this stuff happening to me that I just have to get it out.

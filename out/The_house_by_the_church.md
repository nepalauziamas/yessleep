When I turned 18, I got my drivers license, and figured I wanted to move out of my mom's place, and move in to my father's. My father lives in a town on the outskirt of the city, I originally lived in. 

About five or so years ago, when he and his wife bought the house. I asked him when the house was built and what the story behind the house was. He told me it was built in the mid 1800's, by a family, who didn't have much money. So they rented it out to workers at the nearby paper factory. The family gradually built on the house and ended up with a three story house directly south of the church. 

I figured it was an interesting house with a lot of history behind it, and I settled in quickly. The first night went well, so did the second, but the third night. I couldn't get myself to sleep. I tried and tried until it was close to 4 am. By that time I forced myself to turn around, facing the wall and sleep. After a couple of minutes trying to finally sleep. I felt someone tickle my feet. I started kicking around and went back to pretend-sleeping. Then it started again, and again, and again. And by the time I turned around to see what was going on. I saw a tall man standing in the corner of my room. Just staring at me. After the quick scare, it vanished away and I told myself it was just a hallucination because of the lack of sleep. 

Days goes by and the tickling won't stop. I turn around, but sees nobody. This happens for a week before I ask my step brother if he has ever seen or heard something in the house. He tells me he had that bedroom before I moved in. But because he frequently woke up at night to a man standing in the corner of the room, he wanted to move into the other room right beside. My step mother told him not to tell me anything that was going in the house. Because she didn't want me to be scared now that I finally moved in. 

Some days pass and the tickling had stopped. I brushed it off thinking it was my brain playing tricks on me, because of the new place. But after a while I started to notice things missing, knocks on the door and walls, and somebody going around upstairs. I asked my step mother about it, and avoiding talking to my father, because I knew he didn't believe in this stuff. She tells me she has heard it and seen it herself. And that she didn't wanted to say anything until I experienced it myself. That same evening I was sitting on the couch in the living room with my step mother and father, having a conversation about everything and anything. Suddenly in the corner of my eye, I see a woman standing in the stairway going down to the first floor. As I turn to look at her, she vanished down the stairs. I didn't say anything, but that night I couldn't bring myself to sleep. 

Next morning was Saturday and I sat in the living room on the third floor playing on my step brother's ps4. Right beside the tv was the doorway to my step brother's room, I started to talk to him, so he could explain how I did so and so in the video game. I could hear him going around in there and doing whatever, but he didn't answer me. So I thought for myself "no okay then go F yourself if you don't wanna respond". 5 minutes later I can hear someone going up the stairs. I turned around and I saw my step brother. I went inside his room and my stomach dropped. There was no one in the bedroom. 

I asked him where he was and he told me he was downstairs in the living room. I rushed downstairs to my stepmother and told her, if they still want me to live here. She had to get a medium over to get rid of whatever is in the house. She agreed and the very next week, came a popular medium in the house and "got rid of" the ghosts. He told us that it would almost be impossible to fully clear it out, because of the church right outside the house. Either way we thanked him for his time and went on with our days. 

with one month of silence, my step brother wakes up with scratches on his back. The cat and the dog started to become more aggressive and we still could hear people going around upstairs. 

Heavy cigar and tobacco, perfumes, and rotten eggs was frequent smells in the house. So we called the medium again to tell him about all this. He told us he couldn't get us on the list before next month. However, he could try to dampen it until then. Satisfied with his solution. I figured it would probably be a great idea to look into the depth of the house's history. 

Going further down the rabbit hole I stumbled upon some archives, belonging to the local library. Where I found information about everyone who has lived in this house. It was one family since the mid -1800's, until 2016, they were the last generation before my father bought it off of them. A lot of people had lived here throughout the decades, and many had also died in this house. the youngest was a 15 year old girl, who died of tuberculosis. And a man in his 30's with cancer, a woman who committed suicide, and many other sad fates. A couple hours of research. I also found an article, stating. That on the south of the church (where the house is now) was a graveyard for the people in the town. However, because of the quick clay, the builders of the town and the house, who had little to no knowledge about it. Chose to let the dead people be and dug a deeper hole for them, put them down there and removed the gravestones, and built the house on top of it. 

We're still currently waiting for the medium to contact us again. I will update you when that happens, or if I experience something else.

This all happened two years ago 2020 April 20th to be exact. I first encountered this thing one night when I was sitting around my campfire and I just happened to look at my neighbors window and seen this sickly looking dog starring at me , I knew my neighbors really well best friends in fact and I thought “Oh maybe they adopted a older dog, I’ll ask them tomorrow when I see them” so that’s what I did, They looked at me confused and said “dog?” “We don’t have a dog?” I said “I seen this old looking dog in y’all’s window last night”… And that’s when it all started.  

The next night I was sitting in my chair next to the fire and my sleeping puppy reading a book. When all of the sudden I heard a big bark so loud in fact my ears hurt from it coming from my backyard. My dog now fully awake looks at me in a “you heard that too?” Kinda way. I instantly got up and walked to my back window and seen 2 eyes looking at my house so I grabbed a light and shined it threw my open window and seen the dog the same old dog from the night before in the window.. but it wasn’t a dog… well not a normal one.

It was grey with big bulging eyes tongue hanging to the side and dried blood on its upper lip. I turned around and got my hunting rifle and with my pistol on my hip rifle in hand and my flashlight I went out back as I opened my back door I noticed the dog was no where to be seen. Like it vanished in thin air gone. So I went back in side confused and wondering what the hell I just saw. I sat back down and decided that I was time for a bed as I was brushing my teeth I heard the super loud bark again I peaked out of the blind and nothing was there no eyes nothing just the bark that seemed to come from my back yard, I shook it off and walked to my bedroom and laid down I finally nodded off to sleep 30 minutes later. And not even 30 minutes later I heard the loud bark again and ever hour I woke up again to the loud bark I finally had enough when I got woke up again. And the alarm clock read 3:00 AM in bright red numbers. 

I grabbed my pistol off my night stand and headed down my hallway with my dog not far behind I turned around the corner to go down the stairs and there it is. At the Bottom of my stairs starring at me. Moonlight shining on it like a Erie monster from a movie. I aimed my pistol as my dog started crying at that point I knew it wasn’t my imagination it was there I Aimed and shot one round into its face, it seemed to bounce off this beast and it barked loud and slowly walked away I ran down the stairs flipping on the light and it was gone no where to be found I was confused and scared shaking so bad. 

I sat in my chair wondering what that was, I’ve face grizzly bear at 30 yards with just a bow in the Yukon wrestled bulls but this made me shake bad. As I’m thinking I heard 3 knocks at my door and it made me jump. I ran to the door and opened it ready for anything. Luckily it was just Adam and Bri, they heard the shot and ran over I told them what happened they looked at me confused but believed me because of how shaking up I was. Its 2 years later I have nightmares often haven’t seen it since tho, I moved away from that area and bought a bunch of land with Adam and Bri…What was that thing?..

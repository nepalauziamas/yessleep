Now a shiver was crawling up and down my spine, *”This couldn’t be... could it?”* I was completely speechless, looking at it from the mouth. Fear and excitement was slowly building up in the pit of my stomach at the same time. Had I done it; had I just found my fabled “Little Johnny’s Cave”?

What was in there? Would I hear his footsteps, echoing off the walls of the cave? Would I run into the “monster”? 

Curious, I actually cupped my ear at the entrance to see if I’d hear the soft pattering of little feet across the stone. I heard something that had a similar “tempo”, for lack of any better words, to footsteps, but I could tell they weren’t. *”Probably just droplets of dew from the limestone  or something”*, I told myself, *”but even still...”*

My imagination couldn’t help but kick into maximum overdrive by this point. *”What’s in there?”* I don’t know exactly how long I stood there, gawking in amazement like this *(another 20 minutes maybe... could it have been 30?)*, but it was shattered abruptly when I watched Larry start shambling inside. 

“Larry, wait”, I called to him.

“Don’t worry, I just wanna look for a minute. I’ll be right back, just hold on.” I watched him start to walk deeper and deeper, running his hand along the wall of the cave. I looked at the sky. Now the sun was already a quarter of the way down.

“Dude, we don’t have time. We can come back tomorrow. It’s gonna get dark soon!”

Inside the cave, already mostly gone from sight, I heard Larry shout back, teasing; “What, you afraid of the dark? You scared “the monster’s” gonna get ya?” I then heard him walk deeper into the cave, disappearing completely from view.

“Dude, come on, quit screwing around! We *need* to head back!” I got no response this time. I sighed, “Fine, but when you’re stumbling around, lost in the woods in the dark, don’t come crying to me.” With that, I turned and started to make my way back to the SUV. 

I didn’t make it but five feet away, however, before I realized that Larry had the keys to the SUV. I’d given them to him in the event we had to make an emergency run back (a.k.a. he forgot something, as he often tended to). *”Fuuuck”*, I thought, slapping my forehead. Now I *had* to go after him. 

Almost without thinking, I sprinted into the cave. “Larry”, I shouted, “hey come on, man, seriously we need to go!” No answer. “Larry?!” 

I slowed down. Everything was dark around me; a silent, black void. I took out my phone and turned on the flashlight which, at best, lit up a small radius around me, but basically nothing else. All I could see was the dark, solid stone of the cave around me. Taking another look at my phone, I realized I was screwed again when I saw the battery life read 25%. *”Great...”*

“Larry”, I called again, “damn it, come on! It’s 6:00 now, the sun’s already set!” Silence. *”Where the hell is he? Where did he go, he couldn’t have gotten THAT far... could he?”*

I started walking further, albeit a good bit slower, more hesitant. I couldn’t suppress a shiver that shook through my body in a uniformed convulsion. I won’t lie, I was actually getting nervous here, scared even.

Even with the light I had — the dim, almost dead and already near useless amount of it — all I could see ahead of me was darkness. Maybe “darkness” isn’t the word for it, though; maybe “void” would be more appropriate. See, it wasn’t *just* dark, it wasn’t *just* dead silent, it was *empty*. Ahead of me was basically a black hole that looked, and felt, like it went on for eternity without end. 

*”Of course, though, it HAS to end somewhere, right”* I wondered, trying to grasp onto some kind of hope. *”It’s only just a cave, right? It can’t stretch THAT much further... can it?”* 

*”Is this what it was like for...”*

I stopped, shaking my head. I wasn’t about to start nurturing the idea. *”Get a grip. Just find Larry’s dumb ass and get out.”* My heart shook when I heard an ear splitting shriek in the distance. “Larry?!”

Immediately, I broke from my stupor and took off further into the cave where I heard the noise. I could hear groans of pain trailing from ahead. “Larry, hang on, I’m coming!” 

The more I ran, despite seeming to get closer to where the sounds were coming from, I still seemed at the same time to somehow get no closer to it. “Larry, where are ya?” 

“Here”, I heard from somewhere off to my left. 

“Are you okay?!”

He groaned, “I think my leg’s broken!” My eyes widened and I ran at full speed in his direction. Because I couldn’t see anything, though, that meant I couldn’t see *him* either. That is, until I ended up tripping right over him and face planting right into the stone ground of the cave. 

Larry let out another shriek of pain. “Fuck, that was my leg! Ah shit!”

“Larry, hold on”, I said, scrambling for my bag. I started shuffling around until I was able to find the quote-unquote “First aid kit” I brought (a.k.a. A ziploc bag with a thing of band-aids, neosporin, rubbing alcohol, and a large roll of gauze). I pulled out the gauze and started looking around for a stick or something to use as a splint. 

Larry was in hysterics, writhing and clutching his leg. “Calm down, Breathe”, I said as I started to bandage a nearby twig to his leg, having luckily managed to find a decent enough sized stick. He couldn’t though. He was in too much pain and I was worried he’d start going into shock. 

I pulled a water bottle from my bag, “Here, keep this against your leg. It’s not ice, but it’s all I got.” He managed to calm down just a little when I said this, enough at least to actually hold the bottle against his leg. I knew he was gonna need serious medical attention, but when I went to try and use my phone, unsurprisingly, there was no service. 

As well as this, the battery was almost dead, which meant that it wouldn’t be long before I’d end up losing what little light I had to work with. I started looking frantically around for something, *anything* to use for making a fire. Finally, I was able to find a couple of rocks laying around that, looking closer, looked like they might be obsidian. 

“Take off your shirt.”

“Wh-what’re you doing”, Larry groaned as I began taking off my own shirt and setting them in a pile with the remaining sticks underneath them before scraping the rocks together. 

“Hoping for a miracle”, I replied. Sure enough, said “miracle” was granted and a spark was generated and the shirts caught almost immediately. I knew it wouldn’t last long, but *maybe*, if I were careful, it could last long enough to find us a way out. 

Of course, that was a hell of a lot easier said than actually done. With no signal, no other source of light, and Larry’s leg bent in every different way from what it’s supposed to be, we were essentially stuck. I tried for the first time to look behind me back to the exit. It was then, though, that I found that I couldn’t see the other side. 

At first, I thought it was just because it was nighttime. But after looking back towards the fire, I realized that wasn’t it. It wasn’t just dark, it was *empty*. In other words, the opening was gone completely, almost like it hadn’t been there at all. 

“What the hell”, I said aloud.

“What, what is it?”

“The opening, the way out, dude; it’s gone!”

He groaned, struggling to bring his head up. “What’re you talking about, it’s right— wait... what the fuck?!” His eyes were wide open again, despite having been in excruciating pain. He started hyperventilating, “What the fuck, where’s the exit?!”

“Calm down. I’m gonna get us outta he—“

***Stomp, stomp, stomp*** 

Me and Larry’s heads snapped back towards the depths of the cave at the same time. My heart stopped cold, *”What in the name of God was that?!”*

***Stomp, stomp, stomp*** 

“What the fuck, dude”, Larry cried, hyperventilating again. From ahead, there was still nothing visible but darkness. Yet, the stomping got closer and closer. 

***Stomp, stomp, stomp***

Panic flooded through me. I could feel every urge, every instinct, trying to force me to move; to take off and run. But I couldn’t. 

***Stomp, stomp, stomp***

Larry started squirming. “We gotta get out of here, man”, he squealed, “*We gotta get out of here!*” He started struggling to drag himself towards me. 

***Stomp, stomp, stomp***

That was when I realized that the fire I made was fading. I noticed, though, that it wasn’t exactly like it was flickering or anything like that. It was more like it was dimming; like it was being sucked away or siphoned by the darkness ahead. The same was true with my phone, seeing it start to flicker before going completely dark again. 

***Stomp, stomp, stomp***

The more the fire faded, the more I realized that the darkness was actually *moving closer* towards us! With each earth shaking step towards the two of us, I could see the black wall of nothing inch closer and closer, swallowing more and more of the cave with it. It was right on top of us when the fire finally blinked out like an old lightbulb.

We were engulfed in darkness again; total, pure, and unadulterated darkness. 

***STOMP, STOMP, STOMP***

“Larry”, I cried, spinning in circles, completely blind. “Larry, where are you?!” I got no response from him. Instead I was met only with the stomping. When I ran forward to try and find him, I felt something pull and stretch me from every different direction all at once; trying to pull me apart. I looked to see what it was, but still saw nothing, only darkness.

The darkness itself was attempting to rip me apart. It was *alive*, and and it was hungry! “L-Larry”, I called out again, straining. He made no reply. The darkness must’ve already taken him. The longer I stayed in the darkness, the more I felt as though it was trying to sear the flesh from my bones. 

In the back of my mind, I could hear those words coming back to me — the “monster”; **“You’re mine now... and you’ll never leave my cave...”** 

That’s when I realized what I had to do. I had to do what “Little Johnny” did. *I had to run!*

Summoning every bit, every minute reserve of stamina I had in me (and then some), I turned and bolted like a bat straight outta Hell towards the exit, or at least where I first thought the exit originally was. It was a struggle to move or even breathe. The stomps were in hot pursuit behind me. 

Like with before, all I could see was blackness ahead. The feeling of being stretched was coming from all around me now. The darkness had me encircled. Yet, still I ran. I couldn’t stop, *”I have to get out!”* 

Because of this, I don’t know how long or even really how far I’d ran when I suddenly tripped and was sent tumbling. I could feel an excruciating pain shoot through my right arm when I tried breaking my fall, clearly having broken it. I struggled back to my feet and started sort of limp-running. As much as it hurt to, I had to keep going. 

I could feel my legs starting to ache. I was afraid at any second, I’d collapse again and this time, I wouldn’t be able to will myself back up. Then the darkness, the cave; *the “monster”*, would have me like it had Larry. 

***STOMP, STOMP, STOMP***

*”I’m not gonna make it...”*

Then, as if an Angel was extending me some sort of blessing or “divine intervention”, I saw, dead ahead through the darkness, the opening of the cave. I pushed my body beyond all limit to break into a sprint for it. Behind me, I could hear it quickening its own stride, realizing that I was about to get away. It was getting desperate. 

***STOMP, STOMP, STOMP, STOMP, STOMP, STOMP***

In one last burst, I launched myself from where I was standing out from the cave. Once again, I was sent rolling and tumbling into the woods. When I finally landed still, my body instantly racked all over with aches and pains in almost every part of my body. 

I opened my eyes and looked up. Above me was the night sky, dark silhouettes of trees leering over me. I’d have jumped for joy, if not for the pain coursing through me. I’d done it. I made it out! *”I’m alive!”* I was able to let out a strained laugh of relief. 

This feeling was soon replaced with alarm, *“Larry! He’s still in there!” I looked up and over to the cave. I wanted to go back for him. To rescue him from the cave. *”Just like Little Johnny with his little brother.”*

At the same time, though, I knew that’d be no good. Even if he WERE still alive, not consumed by the darkness like how I almost was, I was in no shape to be able to get him out of there. Thoughts flooded my head, imagining Larry, screaming in terror, his skin being slowly burned away, until only his bones remained. *”What do I do?”*

In the end, I decided to try heading back to the SUV, where I’d then drive out to the nearest town to find help. Admittedly, I wasn’t sure what good anybody else would do, given that it wasn’t like I could give any sort of detail as to *where* in the mountain the cave was. Plus, I knew the chances of finding him inside (or even what could’ve been left of him), alive or dead, would be essentially wafer slim to absolutely none.

It was difficult, having to try and backtrack in the dark,  exhausted and in a lot of pain from my arm (as well as the effects of the darkness still only slowly wearing off), but I couldn’t have cared less. I was determined to make it back to my vehicle. Eventually, come the very beginning of daybreak, I found the SUV again. The last spec of energy was spent shambling for and inside. After that, completely spent physically, emotionally, and mentally, I just laid back in my seat and let exhaustion overtake me.

When I woke again, It was broad daylight outside. My body still ached. I knew with my hand, I wouldn’t be able to drive. When I tried to use my phone, it wouldn’t turn on. Looking around, though, I found that Larry had left his phone in the SUV. Another stroke of luck found me when I saw that, from where I was, I actually had service and was able to call for help. 

It was about an hour and a half that I just sat in the SUV before an ambulance was able to arrive. From that point to now, only a few days later, much of this is just history. I was of course taken to the hospital where I recovered. When asked what happened, I just said that I fell while hiking the mountain. I didn’t try telling the doctors, or anyone else for that matter, about the cave or Larry. *Why bother, it’s not like they could even find it, much less help.*

I also feigned ignorance when trying to figure out what was causing me to feel weak all the time, drained. I was finally discharged a few hours later, where I then returned home. The whole way, all I could do was think about everything that’d just happened. 

What was that in the cave? I mean, I know it was darkness, sure. But how was it so... so *alive?* 

This led me to finally break my little unspoken rule I talked about earlier and ask the one person who’d actually be able to possibly give me some proper answers: Dad. It was yesterday morning that I decided to pay him and Ma a visit. They, of course were ecstatic that I was in town, and I told them that I was glad to see them. 

For a while, I sat and just talked with the both of them for a while until Ma said she (regrettably) had to leave to play BINGO with friends. After she left, that was when I finally decided to ask Dad. Like he would back then when I was little, his face dropped abruptly into that trademark look of stoicism. 

“Dad”, I pushed, “Where did you hear about that story from? Who told it to you?” He just stared coldly at me.

“Nobody told me, son”, he replied in a grave tone. “I didn’t “hear it”, either.” I saw him shudder. He didn’t say anything else after that. Obviously, I wanted to push him, but I could tell I’d already spoiled the cheer from earlier. As it turned out, though, he wouldn’t need to say anything more anyway.

As I apologized and was about to leave, Dad stopped me and thrusted something into my chest. “If ya really want the truth”, he said, “this’ll tell ya all ya need ya know ‘bout “Little Johnny’s Cave.” He then turned and walked away while I did the same, tucking it away in my pocket.

It was when I returned back to the dorm that I looked at what he gave me. It was an old photo of two little boys in what looked to be the woods; with one of the boys presumably being him, judging by how familiar he looked, while the other was someone I didn’t recognize at all. Though, a closer look sent my head spinning. I realized that these weren’t just any two boys; they were the ones pictured in the articles online! 

I also recognized the woods to be the clearing from Grenview Pines where we’d found the cave. The boy standing next to Dad had a circle drawn around him in red and under it were the words; **”I haven’t forgotten ya, Colin — John.”**

That’s when it all clicked. That’s when I finally understood, after all these years and after what happened to me, why Dad was always so scared of that story. I understood just how real it finally was. 

*He* was “Little Johnny”. He lost his best friend; a “brother”, to the darkness of the cave, like I lost Larry. Because of this, even though he made it out in the end, there was, and would always be, a part of him that’s trapped there, surrounded and being ripped apart by the darkness, still trying to find its way out again. And now, the same is true for me. 

I’m gonna end this by saying that there is a reason to fear the dark. It’s a mysterious thing, capable of feats evidently still not yet known. As well as this, it’s hungry, and unless you run to the light, it will take you and devour you the way it did my friend and almost did with me. 

I don’t know if Larry could still be alive. I doubt it, of course. But a part of me still wants to hope that he’s still in there, still running to find the way out. Sometimes... I think I even hear it; his footsteps... still trying to get out.

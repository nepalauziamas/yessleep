Hey guys.... I ran across this site and, well, I figured my encounter might fit. I need to tell someone what happened before it eats me up inside so why not you all. 

Where to start though? Okay, so I recently bought a house. It was one of those "right place, right time" sort of deals as I was already looking for a place when the ad popped up. It's 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms on 1 acre of land and based on the photos was in rough shape but nothing really structurally wrong with it, just holes in the walls, light fixtures half done, and stained carpet. Did I mention it was on the market for only $75,000? I was ready to buy it sight unseen for that price but in reality I called up the selling agent and asked for a showing. 

The next thing I knew I was walking through the property and getting a run down on structural improvements. It was a cute house with only one neighbor next door; a similarly built house with a massive privacy fence encasing the while back yard. Looking at the neighbor I remember asking the realtor, "Aren't there usually limits on how high a privacy fence can go? Between the wood fence and the foliage behind it the thing must reach 15 or 20 feet high." 

Where before she'd been chipper and business like, her eyes quickly darted towards then away from looking at the fence and her body stiffened. "Well yes" she said, "generally there are restrictions in most towns but 5 years ago Mr Carver petitioned the board to have them removed." And that was all she said, nothing more, just took my arm and steered me away from looking at the fence, instead pointing out the rose bushes planted in the backyard of the house we were looking at. 

The house had potential. I didn't know why it was still on the market but I wanted it and was prepared to make an offer by the end of the tour. Turns out, I didn't need to. Well, let me clarify, I didn't need to make the sort of offer I'd been prepared to make. 

Just as we were done with the tour and walking back to our cars the realtors phone rang. I remember her looking down absent minded then stiffening and saying "I apologize, this is important" before answering. 

I couldn't hear anything besides her side which was brief and consisted of:

"Yes, I showed it."
"We haven't discussed that yet"
"Of course I didn't bring that up"
"No worries, everything looks to be in order"
"Are you sure?"
"Apologies, I understand."

And then the call ended. The realtor looked uneasy with her eyes closed as if she were trying to compose herself. Or maybe I imagined it because the next second she was cheerful again remarking "Excellent news! That was the sellers and they actually came down on the asking price. Today is your lucky day! They are switching the sale over to an auction apparently. No minimum bid, blind bidding. If you're interested in this house all I'll need from you is a minimum bid and a maximum bid. After five days the bidding will close and the highest price takes the place. How EXCITING!" 

There's always a catch. I knew the $75,000 price tag was too low and apparently so did they. Of course I had wanted to get the place for a steal but after everything else looked so bad for so much, I might as well test my luck I figured. No harm in trying. 

And that is how I ended up paying $20,000 for my new house. Shocking I know. Unbelievable, if it hadn't happened to me I'd say the same thing. But it did. I put in a minimum bit of $20,000 with a maximum bid of $150,000 and 5 days later I was signing papers acknowledging I'd won the bid. No one else had even entered a single entry. 

Yes, in hindsight it was weird. Looking back all sorts of bells were ringing and lights were flashing but at the time I figured I was the luckiest person on the planet. Now though, I know better. 

Everything pushed through easily and within 30 days I was not only the new owner, I was already fixing the place up and making the interior look brand new. There was a lot I could do since I hadn't needed to spend much for the actual house so I fixed the walls, redid all of the floors, changed out the pipes and plumbing, and finally rewired the electrical. 

And so, there I was, finally moved in and spending my first night in my new home. I didn't even get a single night to myself before it started. 

At 3 am exactly, screaming began. It lasted exactly 10 seconds before ending. 

A light sleeper I was naturally brought wide awakeÂ  by the sound. My first thought was that it was a joke. I mean, I wasn't certain why someone would play a joke on me like that but the fact that the screaming stopped almost just as soon as it started was just plain weird. Who does that, and at 3am? It had to be a joke so I put it out of my mind and went back to sleep. 

The next night it happened again. Exactly 3am I'm woken up to a scream lasting exactly 10 seconds. 

And again the following night. Screams. 3am. 10 seconds. 

By the fourth night I set an alarm for 2:50am so I could be prepared if it happened again. Wide awake this time I stopped and paid attention to what I was hearing. Yes, it was a scream but who was screaming? I couldn't be positive but after multiple nights I was fairly certain it had to be a male scream. And what's more, I felt like rather than just tapering off after 10 seconds, that the screaming was being cut off. Some nights it seemed more abrupt than others. 

Logic dictated that the only male that could be screaming was my new neighbor, Mr Carver. I had yet to actually see him since moving in, let alone talk to him so I had nothing to go off other than his name. Maybe, I thought, this was all a "welcome to the neighborhood" prank. Surely he will get tired of this eventually, right? 

I was wrong. 

Weeks went by, all the same, never changing. Some nights I could almost start to sleep through the screams. Other nights my curiosity had me up half the night, my mind racing, trying to figure out what was going on over there. After two months I was determined to go over and ask him what his problem was. Ask him to please stop. 

So I did. 

I waited until a time when I saw his car in his driveway and walked over. Let's just say I didn't exactly get the answer I was looking for. 

After stepping onto his porch and knocking on the door I didn't have to wait long before I heard one, two, three locks coming undone and for the door to open. Just a crack, sure, but enough to hear, "Can I help you?" from the voice of an older gentleman. 

"Hi, I'm Jamie. I just moved in next door a couple months ago and thought I would come over to say 'hi'." Yes, terribly generic, I know but it wasn't like I could just walk up and demand "why are you screaming out in the middle of the night" now could I? 

The door stayed mostly shut but did open just a crack more before he responded "Congratulations, do you want a medal? What does that have to do with me?" His words were harsh and cruel, said with a bit of a sneer and I was instantly on edge. How dare this man be so rude. 

I tried again. "No, no medal, I just figured it might be nice to get to know eachother a little. It looks like you've lived here a long time and I appreciate that. I'd hate to be the sort of neighbor who lives next to each other for years but have never even said "hi". This is me saying "hi"." 

From behind the I heard a humph and then a loud sigh. Not even saying a word I could tell I was wearing on his patience and it made me antsy. I just wanted to find a way to ask about the screams. He was NOT making it easy. 

"L-l-look," I stuttered, "I'm sorry for bothering you, I was just trying to be friendly bu-" he cut me off. 

"No. No you weren't just trying to be friendly. You're nosy. Just like the people who lived there before you, and the people before them, and the people before them." He sounded almost angry as he spit this out and continued saying, "you're right, I have been here a long time. Longer than you by far and no, I don't want to be friends. So leave me and my property alone if you know what's good for you." The door opened a little more before he said menacingly "Don't mess where you don't belong and maybe you'll live in you're nice new house for more than a year or two. Do you understand?" 

I'll freely admit, I didn't know what to say to that. Was he threatening me? I couldn't know for sure but I did know I wasn't going to stand around and be yelled at. So I left. I didn't press him any further and left. Maybe I should have but I don't know for sure. At the end of the day I just nodded my head, turned around and walked home. The only sound to follow was him shutting the door again with a hard thud, and one, two, three locks clicking in to place.

That night, the screams lasted 11 seconds and they've lasted 11 seconds each night for the last 2 weeks. 

I know he warned me but my quality of sleep is nonexistent and I feel like I'm slowly going crazy. I've decided to buy some cameras and try to see into his back yard. I need to know what's going on. I can't explain it but it's almost like these screams are pulling me in, setting my nerves on edge, even during the day. 

He's just a silly older gentleman, what could possibly be on the other side of that fence that he doesn't want anyone to see?

I had applied to my new school everything seemed normal until my first day 

The person showing me around handed me a list titled school rules then they handed me a map of the school and the rooms I had to be in the that day , All they said was do as the list says and nothing bad will happen there where about 20 rules on the list 
1.don’t arrive before 8:40 
Normal I thought maybe they had to set up ?

2.don’t stay after class even if a teacher asks 
That one caught my eye a bit I thought it was a bit odd but I brushed it off 

3.don’t smoke at all on school premises 

4. Don’t speak when in class or in the hallway 

5.when going into the bathroom stall knock 3 times before entering

I got 1,2,6,7,15,16,17,19 but the rest was odd 

After that he said to only rust him and I said ok and we walked in to class well tried to it was 7:39 so I pulled them back for some reason seeing the time . 

He looked at me with a smile on his face and whispered “now I trust you don’t betray it and keep to the list learn it well” 

I whispered back “ok” and bang on 8:40 we entered the teacher said hello and being weary I didn’t say anything due to rule 4.

Classes where a bit odd but it was lunch time I found the boy and we both at packed lunches and this is when I realised something was definitely off .

Someone shouted “LET ME OUT “ and started screaming calmly 2 teachers came in and she just fell , not like a trip and hit his head type fall but a body just gone limp and snaked on the floor I went to fast but I felt a hand over my mouth and a look of pls don’t .

It was the next day and I started to walk to school and saw the boy who was showing me around waiting at the gate ,at this point I was a bit embarrassed I had forgotten to ask his name but I asked anyway “ do you need to know “ he said raising his eyebrows witch was I think the biggest sentence he’s said to me .

I raised my eyebrows and said “ would u rather me call u boy ?” His personality outside of school was a lot better , he let out a sigh and said “mark” ok at least I know someone’s name now I thought to myself I told him my name and it turned 8:40 so we went in we sat in our seats and all I could think  is how his personality can change within seconds I started to wonder if people saw me like that and just like that I had zoned out.

As the teacher shouted my name I lifted my head swiftly and he told me to see him after class , nodded my head and as soon as he turned back to the visibly old chalkboard I almost silently grabbed the paper and checked to se if that was a rule because I wasn’t sure 

As soon as I realised it was I looked up and over at mark we made eye contact and he had an uncomfortable and worried look .

There was 5 minutes left of class and I was preparing to run out of there and when I did the thing I least expect happened the teacher started chasing after me , I had no idea what to do so I ran into the bathroom and into the stall …

Without knocking my stomach sank I opend  the door and knocked 3 times hoping it would go away I waited in the bathroom hoping nothing would come out of the stall and around 20 minutes later I left and started looking for mark because it was lunch no sign of anyone I looked everywhere 

I am alone all I have is my bag with my phone some book and pens . I can’t call anyone not even the police so this is my last resort .

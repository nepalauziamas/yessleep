I usually don't visit my friends unless it was for something special,but I was invited by one of closest friends to their house...how could I say no to them? I was weirded out since it was the middle of the night,but I had gotten into my car a drove over to their house. I arrived at her house,a regular looking suburban house with is fancy gate and well kept yard. I called her to tell her I was here,and the gate opened.

She always had this particular look on her face,she didn't have that same look that day. She looked disturbed and she didn't smell like her usual rose scent. (I smell my friends sometimes,it isn't obvious though the smell just hits my nose.) I smiled at her before she told me,"Oh I have some company I hope you don't mind!" I muttered,"Of course I don't!" I walked into her house to see at least 20-30 people all dress in white or black. That wouldn't be out of the usual since she asked me to wear that too,and I of course obliged. 

I was greeted by each person,and noticed they all had the same tattoo on their forearm,and rose. Okay. Kinda of weird. I was nervous but she lead me onto the couch,and took out something from a drawer. Live.rats. fucking.live.rats. No. Infact a little part of me wanted to scream another part of me wanted to leave immediately,but for some reason I stayed. 

I then heard some guy yell,"Let the ceremony begin!" What ceremony? What the fuck is happening? Why am I here? All of those thoughts flooded through my mind as the men and women went to sit in the living room. Each of them staring at the rats almost in hunger. Like they wanted to eat these dead most likely rotting rats. I wanted to grab my chest since it started hurting and this smell of rotting rats,dirt,and must coming from these people was absolutely Ridiculous. 

The same guy said,"Welcome to this nights ceremony I see that a few of you have brought new people." I malicious grin appeared on his face. The new people must've been the people on the couch beside me, because the looked as nervous as me. 
The cage of the rats was opened and each rat was cut open and some of the rotten meat was taken out of it. They told us that they wanted us to eat it.

We stared at each other before one of us slowly grabbed the meat and nibbled at it. I was scared as more of us got the courage to try that. It was time for me to now. I slowly grabbed the meat and nibbled at it before putting it down. I couldn't do this anymore. I had to leave this place. I stood up and slowly left the living room as they all just stared at me. I left that house. I drove back home as fast as I could and when I woke up the next morning that same rose tattoo was on my forearm.

I like to take my camera down into the depths of the old subway station.


There are Long stretches of abandoned track deep under the city.


It's illegal for sure, but nobody patrols down there.


There's graffiti on every crumbling wall.


One symbol in particular is repeated all throughout the tunnels the deeper I venture.


The symbol is a triangle surrounding a single eye. The eye itself seems to be melting out of the triangle and dripping down to the floor below. 


Not too weird if you're from where I'm from. But the repetition is strange. Like this is gang turf. Eye gang turf or something.


Rusted conduit, wires, and pipes crawl across ceiling and walls like blood vessels. 


Rats, cats, dogs, bugs, possums all live down there. It's a manufactured ecosystem.


People live there too. They are different than surface dwellers. They see better in the dark, their senses attuned to their environment.


These are people the city failed or their parents failed, or God failed.


Their society is violent, might makes right there in the dark.


I take pictures of the graffiti, of the rats and cats, and dogs and possums, of the people there. 


Sometimes I interview these people. Narratives have always been a fascination of mine, and these people have the most interesting stories.


I bring a backpack of food fresh from the grocery store. When the children see me they come running, calling out.


"It's the grocery man! The grocery man!" This is a good feeling. I can help if even just slightly.


Some of the adults tell me stories of their lives as accountants. Some were in boys homes or psychiatric wards most of their lives. 


I capture their stories and bring them to the surface. Cutting them together into videos. Maybe people will care one day, maybe they'll do something. 


Until then, I keep a record of their plight.


Last night. I went deeper than I'd ever been before. Still following those eye symbols.


They caught my curiosity in a strange way. I was drawn to them.


There was a symbol painted onto a rubbled ceiling. I could see a few gaps between the collapsed concrete and was able to wedge myself inside.


The people there were more shy. They would hide in crevices when they heard me splashing along the tracks, or run down the corridors into darker corners of the station.


The tunnels there must have been built first, ages ago. 


I came to a split in the tunnel. I could feel eyes from deep pits of shadow around me.


I brought out my food pack and shined my light around me.


The crinkling of food bags brought the people out to a wary distance.


They shrunk back when the light hit them.


I was close to running when I saw their forms in the light. 


One looked at me from behind a rotting crib that must have been brought down from the surface.


His back was so hunched that his head sat parallel with his shoulders. His arms hung down almost like a quadruped.


Another stood in the open. Staring down on me. She did not attempt to cover her naked sagging breasts or the cleft between her legs. 


That wasn't the strange part about her though.


Her midsection was stretched upward,  thinning before finally meeting her ribcage. Stretch marks lined her concave belly. She had to have been seven feet tall.


There were all kinds of abnormalities in these people. A girl with a head half the size it was supposed to be. Another who's bottom half was simply not there, he hung from the ceiling on a DIY swing.


I did not run. These were people. People in dire circumstances that needed help. Pollution, or just malnutrition had distorted them.


I pulled the food out of my pack and showed them. 


The tall woman was the first to step forward. I handed her a bag full of bananas, apples, oranges and other fruit.


She snatched it away from me and stepped back. Then the others came forward. I gave them similar bags canned vegetables, trail mix, nuts, freeze dried berries.


A slender boy, who did not have the deformations the others carried, had a can of corn. 


He couldn't figure out how it opened,  so he hit it on the concrete walls and on rocks. He'd manage to make a crack in the side of the can. Water dribbled out.


I called him over, it took some coaxing but he finally tiptoed up to me.


I reached in my bag, he jumped back, the others stood at attention.


I slowly removed my hand from the bag, producing a handheld can opener.


He relaxed and so did his entourage.


I gestured for him to give me the can. He did and I put the opener up to the lid a few times, showing him how to do it. Then I popped a hole in the top and started cutting around the rim of the can, and simply peeled it back.


The boy clapped and I noticed that the others had been paying close attention to us.


I handed the can and the can opener to the boy.


He jumped up and down and then went around to each member of the group and showed them how to use it.


When they had finally cleaned my bag of food, I stood and grabbed my camera where it hung on my chest.


I motioned for one of them to come forward.  They hesitated, some even backing away from me.


But the boy,  perhaps still high from the discovery of can opening skills, came forward.

 

He looked back at the others and looked at me.


I pointed the little speedlight flash I had at the ceiling and then snapped a picture. 


The flash illuminated their terrified faces.


The tunnel was filled by sound, splashing, screaming, running.


I felt something brush by me and almost fell on my ass.


When my eyes readjusted to the dark, all the denizens of the tunnel had disappeared back into their dark corners.


Totally should have expected that.


I checked the picture. 


The boy in the foreground with a look of utter betrayal on his face. All the others were running for cover 


I'd need to come back here and get them used to the camera over a few weeks.


I decided to move deeper into the dark.


Past the chamber where those people were living was a long stretch of tunnel that curved near the end. 


As I approached the curve I could hear the scuttling of rats, and much bigger things hiding in panels and voids as my flashlight beam swept right to left. 


I had always thought there were people living deeper in the station. But I'd never imagined those deformed, animalistic types down here. This would likely be interesting to a few of the journalism majors. Maybe even a major outlet.


"Protohumans just beneath our feet." The headline would kill on social media.


It might even get the begrudging interest of the mayor. Best case scenario, a task force might actually come down here and try to address the problem.


These people needed help, real help, not just some half baked legislation that really only profited the 99% in this city.


As I rounded the curve I saw rubble stacked up to the ceiling, blocking my path further down the tunnel. I thought for a moment that I would have to turn around and head back out. 


But something stood out to me.


That symbol was painted on the wall to my left.


Below the symbol there was an iron panel inlaid in the concrete. Most of these panels are bolted to the floor. But this one was askew. In the crack was darkness.


I pursed my lips, put my hand on my hip. Thinking about just calling it a night.


Then I thought about that headline again. How much publicity it could get these people. How much it could help.


I removed the panel and shined my light into the darkness inside.


There was a rusty ladder and a dirt floor about twelve feet down. The ladder was surrounded by stone that had been laboriously chiseled out into a tunnel.


I looked at my phone. 2:37 AM.


I snapped pictures of what I could and headed back. I'm going back another night this week so I'll put out an update soon.


I may have stumbled on something big down there

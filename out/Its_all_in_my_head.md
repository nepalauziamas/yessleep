Â stood in my room zoning as I'm doing this. I hear a tapping on my window. I live on the second story of an apartment so there was no way anyone could reach it. So at first I thought it was rain mainly because there were no trees around. But as I stood the tapping turned into banging then I yelled for my mom forgetting I was home alone. Then I heard a door down the hallway creek open. I froze in fear then the door creaked again. After minutes which felt like hours I got the courage to stand and open my door. 

As I did I saw a head solid black with tiny white eyes. As I was staring into those colorless eyes I heard something behind me. As I turned around there was nothing but when I looked back at the creature it was standing. It was about 9 ft tall with solid black skin and its fingers were 4 feet. It let out a horrible scream un human like. I slammed my door closed and locked it. The creature banged on it for what felt like hours but was only seconds. After a few seconds of banging everything went silent. No noise came from anywhere till the closet door creaked open ever so slightly. I realized I have a vent in my closet. 

But after thinking there could be no way that thing could fit through I heard humming from the cracked closet door. As the humming grew louder the door became more and more open. As I sit dumbfounded I snap back to my senses and realize I could jump out the window and get help. But then again I live in the second story so it wouldn't kill me. I jumped and as I did the closet slammed open and a creature ran out. When I hit the ground I looked up and saw it looking out the window. Slowly the creay backed up from the window back into my room. I waited for the cops to get to my house then 2 cops showed up. They searched the house up and down but all they found was a busted down back door. The cops figured out that's how the creature got in to the house. After hours of trying to tell the cops it wasn't a person I finally gave up. Nobody would believe me that a 9 ft monster broke in. 

I had to go back into the house. I woke up at 2:21 in the morning to go piss and as I was walking I found my mom's bedroom door open. As I walked in and turned on the light I found my mom and brothers throat slit and then my heart stopped. The humming started again. But the humming turned to demonic laughing and I heard the door creak closed one last time. I ran into the bathroom after and locked the door. I looked into the mirror realizing that I had a bloody knife and face. Then I realized the monster never existed the only monster was the one looking in the mirror.

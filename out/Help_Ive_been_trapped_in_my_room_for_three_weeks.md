I don’t know what’s going on. I’m trying to stay sane. But I’m losing it. I can’t leave my room no matter how hard I try. No matter what I do. I’m always brought back here. It doesn’t make sense.

&#x200B;

I’ve been trapped in my room for three weeks. It sounds like some kind of draconian COVID quarantine, but maybe that’s because I’m not being specific enough about my circumstances. To be honest, I’m not sure you’ll believe me even if I tell you. I can’t leave my room. Literally. I’m frankly amazed I have internet connection.

&#x200B;

It started without warning. I got up one morning, and I simply couldn’t exit my room. I got up like any normal morning, and I opened my door…to my own room. At first I thought maybe I was just having sleep paralysis or I was still dreaming. But I soon realized I was wide awake. I couldn’t believe it, it seemed like some sick joke. I’d open my door, and on the other side was my own room. I’d peer down the room towards the other door, and see myself from behind. I’d watch my self exit the room and enter from the door. In some angles, I could see nothing but repeating images of room, in an infinite stream, like when you take two mirrors and let the reflections bounce off each other. I know it sounds crazy, impossible. Maybe I have lost my mind. But I can only conclude I’m still sane. Otherwise this wouldn’t be so unbelievable.

And before any of you ask, I tried everything. And I mean everything. When I realized my own door would just lead me back inside my own room, I tried going out through the window. You guessed it. I would step back into my own room. Well, they say the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, so I eventually gave up on using the exits. I decided to try and contact someone outside of my room. I called my friend, and they didn’t answer their phone. I called my mother. I called my girlfriend. I even tried calling 911. I was always sent to voicemail. It doesn’t make sense. How could emergency services have a voicemail?

&#x200B;

I’m at a total loss to explain it. I didn’t do anything unusual. Didn’t buy some cursed object. Didn’t mess with a gypsy woman. Hell, it was a totally normal day before this happened. Went to work, came home, did the usually stuff. Didn’t do any drugs. Didn’t eat anything funny. I just don’t know what has happened.

I got desperate last week and tried to literally kick down my wall. I managed to get a hole through it. I managed, somehow, to tear down a hole. It took me over an hour. I started weeping when I finished. It led right back to my room. I haven’t spoken to anyone in weeks. I have no food. No water. Somehow I’m not dead or lacking in energy. I’m not even hungry or thirsty. The hole is still in my wall. I dislike looking at the weird trippy effect exiting the room has, so I’ve pinned a bed sheet over the hole. I keep the curtains over my window for the same reason. I tried looking at the vent in my ceiling, hoping there might be a way out. I can’t hear anything though. It’s total silence. There’s no light, and its too small for me to get through.

&#x200B;

I haven’t stopped trying to reach people. I gave up on calling people, so I tried texting. I have yet to get a response. I was delighted when I found I had internet access. I tried using the online emergency services. I got a message back saying it was offline. I tried messaging friends and family on Facebook. It seems like they’re all ignoring me. The internet seems to be working fine however. The websites all update. I can comment and everything. But no one replies or even interacts with my comments. I tried everything. I tweeted. I put up stories on Snapchat. God, I even commented under porn videos, all to no avail.

&#x200B;

So this is it. This is my last hope. I’m posting here on r/nosleep because I’ve read other stories people have gone through. This may be the only place on the internet where someone might believe me.

&#x200B;

Is God doing this to me? Am I even in the same reality as before? Am I dead and trapped in some kind of fucked up hell? Is it something else? I just can’t figure it out. There’s no explanation. I tried researching on google, since I have nothing better to do. But I’ve found virtually nothing. The results all flooded with stories of COVID quarantines. I’ve been growing out my helplessness with Youtube and Netflix, trying to distract myself for a while from this nightmare. It doesn’t last for long though, because I’m reminded that I can’t get out. Nothing is seeming to help. I’m just hoping and praying someone will see this. That someone will comment or react, or message me. I can’t be alone. Please tell me I’m not alone. That someone can actually see this. I’m going insane. I’m totally hopeless. I don’t know how much longer I can last in my room.

&#x200B;

Please, someone please help me.

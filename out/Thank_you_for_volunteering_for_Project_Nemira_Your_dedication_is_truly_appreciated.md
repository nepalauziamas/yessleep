The message ended with the following words: “For those who decide to help the US Government in this endeavor, a high five-figure compensation will be provided, as well as facilitating the opportunity for earlier retirement. Reply with Y for Yes and N for no. We will be in contact.”

“Damn, Jackson. Are you reading this?” I asked the guy sleeping next to me.

“Yeah, I got it too. But who the hell sent it, though?” Jackson replied.

“I heard talks about a team of scientists within the military. The legend has it they do some sort of behavioral studies on soldiers: how they sleep, how they act in combat, how they react to violent photos and movies, things like that, you know?” I told him. “They go by Unit Nemira.”

“You and you bullshit conspiracies, Williams. I’ll still say yes to this. I have already seen enough shit to last me for a lifetime, so what more can it be to it?” he spat.

“Same here. Boom, sent.” I replied while placing the phone on the nightstand.

Of the twenty people in the room, we were the only ones to get the text messages. Ah hour after enrolling in the program, we got the details in another text message.

“Leaving tomorrow morning at 0600. Special transportation will be outside the camp. Your superiors have been informed and kindly agreed to let you go for a few days. See you soon.”

The next morning a black truck waited for us at the crack of dawn. Men dressed in black paramilitary uniforms greeted us. They instructed us to go in the back of the truck and that they would let us know when he would arrive.

I felt the temperature dropping along the way, and it took us maybe five hours to get there. The truck stopped, and I heard the door unlocking. We were somewhere deep within the mountains at a secret location. 

We shivered on our walk from the truck to the entry into that facility. A man in his sixties greeted us. He had a long grey beard and round spectacles. He talked with a lisp. The badge said Campbell.

“Good day, gentlemen. My name is Dr. Liam Campbell. First, let me welcome you here to our Nemira Headquarters. Thank you both for volunteering for Project Nemira. Your dedication is truly appreciated,” the man in the white lab coat said. 

“Good to be here,” I replied.

“Yeah, can you debrief us on this project?” Jackson said.

“Yes, of course. The others are waiting for you in the main hall. Let’s get you there, and I will tell you all about Nemira,” Campbell replied.

We walked through some rooms where I saw scientists studying various liquids in vials. At one point, I saw maggots being pumped with fluids and instantly growing bigger. They were aggressive too.

We met the rest of our team upon arrival in the main hall. Three women with an extraordinary skillset, combat experience, and sheer intelligence and three men who looked like they had seen the end of the world and survived twice.

Campbell gave us our NDAs to sign before the debriefing session and appointed Jackson as team leader. Then, he went on to tell us what we had to do and what Project Nemira represented.

“You will be injected with our enhancing fluids. This will highly enhance your senses, and you will be able to better see in the dark, hear better, smell the enemy approaching, and trust me, there will be plenty. Also, your sixth sense will be activated when the compound kicks in,” Campbell said.

When we heard about the sixth sense, some laughed, some rolled our eyes, and others scoffed. I did all three. 

Campbell shook his head. 

“Yeah, and then we’ll catch ghosts, yeah?” Garcia said. She was the tallest of the three women and looked like she had seen hell and kicked the Devil in the nuts.

“That’s exactly what you will do!” Campbell said. “Or die trying!”

Our faces fell to the ground. Surely this man didn’t think of ghosts. Or maybe he was just some lunatic scientist with too much time and money on his hands, and he decided to spend it all on paranormal activities.

Tears welled in his eyes as he looked at each and every one of us. The man didn’t joke, and I realized he had given all his life to this project.

He named the project after his daughter. Nemira fell into a water tank while her father left her alone for just a minute (his words), and he heard her cries for help, but it was too late. The body had never been recovered. They had drained the water tank, but Nemira had vanished. No one knew how or where her body might have gone.

Soon after that, strange things began happening in the facility. Employees of the facility had said that they heard a little girl crying in the halls of this enormous concrete building. Others noted that CCTV signals sometimes were scrambled, or there were short power outages in the building. 

Campbell began investigating these claims, and it only got worse. People started disappearing under his watch, and he knew something was wrong.

He handed us weapons that shot some energy bullets, as he said. He said that upon impact with an entity not of this world, the shell would explode and manage to keep that entity in place until a special unit would come and contain it. He also handed us special-made night-vision goggles that would make it easier for us to see in the spirit world.

Of course that this all seemed madness to me. But a job was a job. In these types of projects and facilities, everything should be expected. So if this Campbell guy had so much money and workforce at his disposal, it meant he did something right in his field.

He was paying us, so I had to follow his orders. We got the codename Unit Red Cardinal. Campbell said it was Nemira’s favorite bird. 

I looked at him long and hard. I studied him. It was as if there were two different people inside —Campbell, the scientist, the genius who could see beyond the veil, and Campbell, the broken father, the man who just wanted to see his daughter one more time. He told us he just wanted to give her a proper burial if we would find her remains. But, he also wanted to hear her voice one more time.

But he warned us. Even though he was grieving and damaged beyond repair, he told us to take care because spirits could be evil. He told us not to be fooled by what we would see and to act swiftly. 

He instructed us to go to the lowest level of the facility. Campbell said we would be on our own and look out for each other. We had to do a perimeter sweep and report back in an hour.

He wished us luck as we descended the elevator. It felt like being in one of those horror sci-fi movies where there’s a team of mercenaries hired to retrieve something dangerous from a distant planet. The complete and utter isolation added to the tension.

We all turned on our night vision, and I have never felt more aware than then. The liquid injected into my veins made its effects known. The only sound I heard was our footsteps. This level was damp and untended. No one has ever been there before.

Somewhere in the distance, I heard footsteps running. 

“Who’s there?” Jackson asked.

No reply.

We pushed forward, and I found a teddy bear. Its pink color was barely visible, soaked with water, and one of its eyes was missing. 

“This belonged to Nemira. Campbell said she always used to carry it around. Mr. Sparkles,” I said and gently placed it against a wall.

Still, we moved forward. A little girl’s cries cut through the silence like a knife through butter. Then footsteps ran again. 

Miller started running. We all yelled at him to stop and come back, but it was too late. A black slimy tentacle came out of the darkness and shot through his mouth. It lifted him in the air, then repeatedly slammed him to the ground until he didn’t breathe anymore. Bones crunching and flesh squishing, it was one of the most gruesome deaths I have ever witnessed. 

We also had assault rifles and began shooting at the tentacle. Black blood squirted on the walls, and a high-pitched wail almost rendered us deaf. It retreated into the darkness it belonged.

“What the hell was that thing?” Garcia asked. She was shivering. 

“Watch your six, people. We are not alone. Let’s find the girl and get it over with,” Jackson said.

“Ah, spiders!” one of the women said. I didn’t even get her name. “Get them off, get them off me!”

She fell to the ground in a second. Then, spiders came out of her nose, ears, and eyes and grew in size. We all ran as fast as our legs could carry us. All of a sudden, we stopped.

A little girl with hair black as coal stood before us. She pointed to us with her head tilted to the side and her skin as white as a sheet. She shivered. She was cold. 

I turned around and saw Davis up in the air. He floated, and his joints cracked from an unseen pressure. His eyes exploded, and the skin peeled off as he screamed in agony. 

Then Nemira looked at me, twitched her head, and threw me against a wall. The air left my lungs violently, and I became dizzy and almost lost consciousness.

“Nemira, please. We are here to save you,” Jackson said. “Your father is waiting for you upstairs, heartbroken. He misses you so much and wishes to see and talk to you again. Please, stop,” 

She conjured a snake suffocating Garcia by the neck. 

“I found your teddy bear, Mr. Sparkles. He needs your help to get better. He said it’s too dark here and wanted to go into the light. Also, did you know your father keeps a red cardinal in his office? It reminds him of you; he said it’s your favorite bird,” I said, barely breathing.

“He left me to die. He never found me. I fell into the murky and dark waters. I drifted endlessly, not knowing where I was. I’m cold and I…,” the pour soul didn’t get to finish her sentence.

Jackson fired the rifle Campbell gave us, and a ball of electricity surrounded Nemira. She couldn’t move anymore, and she was trapped. 

The snake had disappeared, and Garcia coughed and gasped for air.

I heard the elevator coming down, and a team of people dressed in hazmat suits led by Campbell approached us. 

Campbell fell to his knees, and his head hung low.

“Oh… My sweet Nemira… How much I’ve missed you,” he said.

“Dad… I can’t… It hurts…. Why are you doing this?” the little girl replied.

“It will all be over soon, honey. Trust your dad, please.” Campbell said. For a moment, I thought he wanted to go and kiss her on the head.

“Thank you. You have been paid for your services. You are free to go,” he said, turning to us.

We all nodded and turned around to the elevator. 

“You think this will stop me, dad?” Nemira said.

I turned and saw that the big energy ball surrounding her grew bigger and bigger, almost as if it was ready to explode.

“Run to the elevator!” I screamed.

I frantically pushed the button, and we managed to get out before the building collapsed from the explosion. Jackson and I managed to find a way back home.

What I saw that day would never leave my mind. The power that little girl holds is of unimaginable proportions. 

I wonder what will happen to her. I wonder what she will do if she ever escapes that place.

Hello.  My name is Robert Baker.   I the captain of the Sevierville, Tennessee police department.

Three weeks ago a 22 year old college student by the name of Shelby Clarkeson, went missing while attempting to report on a 15 year old story.  Clarkeson, a college student at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville and a journalist for our local newspaper recently disappeared while trying to report on a disturbing mystery that started getting revisited recently.

A little backstory.

In 2007 two hikers were attacked by an "unearthly" creature while hiking the Great Smokey Mountains on the outskirts of Sevierville.  Throughout the years there has been over 32 reports of witnessing and even being attacked by this creature.

In 2015 a trio of hunters attempted to take down this beast, and although they did take down a vicious animal, they failed to get the right creature.

The story recently resurfaced after a 62 year old veteran by the name of Pete Crusader committed suicide after seeing the creature.   Pete Crusader, a veteran who suffered with PTSD and schizophrenia witnessed the beast, and afterwards, shot himself with an assault rifle.

Around a week after the death of Mr. Crusader, Shelby Clarkeson went missing.  A three day search resulted in the finding of a journal in which belonged to Ms. Clarkeson.

After thoroughly reading, and asking for permission from family.  We are now able to share this journal.

This is the official last report of Shelby Clarkeson.

I'm staying in a small secluded cabin in the mountains.  Honestly I love the loneliness.  It's so peaceful up here.  Well I should probably start documenting the actual reason why I'm here.

Met with detective Ronald J. Pickins:

Q.  What do you know about this thing?

A.  All I know is that it's not friendly and has caused terror for more that a decade.

Q.  Have you ever seen it?

A. Sort of.  We where investigating a murder presumably by this thing and I thought I saw something stalking us.  But obviously I was already pretty anxious.

Q.  What is your opinion on how to stay protected from this beast?

A. Don't adventure into these woods unless it's necessary that you do.  And if you do, make sure to be armed.  If you ever see it on your property, let the right people handle the situation.  Don't attempt to make contact.

Q.  Ok, and what is your advice for anyone like myself who is searching for answers?

A.  Be ready.

Found a deer trail that leads the animal to it's death.

Met Justin Creole:

Name: Justin Cane Creole

Age: 24

Occupation: Taxidermist

Hobbies: Hunting

Stumbled across some circle with ashes in the middle.  Also found a voodoo doll and deer skull nearby.  Could this mean anything?

Encountered a elderly homeless man, who told me to leave the forest or else something bad would happen.

Overall today was good, besides the hermit man.  He was very odd and made me very uncomfortable.  I also hope to look more into what the stone ring I found was.

I found a dead person today.  As I was walking through the woods, I saw the outline of a person seemingly floating through the fog.  From a closer view I realized this guy wasn't floating, but hanging from a rope.   It looked like he had been there for a long time.  It seemed that he had hung himself.  But why?

This place is so off.

I found a seemingly abandoned hut, that had multiple documents lying around.  I took them with me and will paraphrase what they say once I return to the cabin.

I also found what looked to be a place where they perform rituals behind the hut.

I'm starting to feel really sick.

The documents I found are from October 2006.  The writer is addressing the letters to Xen and the writer talks about how the ritual is complete.  It goes on to say how the entity they summoned takes the place of a hairless dog or wolf.

Could this entity be the beast I'm looking for?

I didn't sleep at all.

I puked at least three times throughout the night, and had diarrhea multiple times.

I also began coughing up blood around 3:40 and still feel terrible.

I think I'm just gonna rest today.

**Saturday September 17th, 2022**

I haven't slept in two days.

I almost fell asleep but was startled by banging on my bedroom window.  The hermit man I ran into previously was at the window banging and chanting something in Latin.

After using some translation tools I figured out he was yelling " relinquere nunc vel aliud"  or in English "leave now or else".

By the time the sun rose he had left.

Something is wrong, I don't feel like myself.  Something is watching me.  I did something terribly wrong.  I keep two reflections of myself in the mirror.  One reflection is me now, while the other is myself in terrible condition.  I don't know how much longer ill make it.

**Sunday September 18th, 2022**

I killed someone today.

A fellow journalist for the same newspaper I work for arrived at my cabin today to check in a see how things where going.

However, as I was walking to the door voices in my head starting telling me to kill her.

Something took control of my body, and I picked up a kitchen knife, opened the door, and stabbed her.  Over and over and over and over I stabbed, while cursing.

After I was finished, I saw what I had done and somehow had no regret.

It's what the bitch deserved.  She can rot in the pits of hell for all I care.  Dumb bitch.

**Monday September 19th, 2022**

I'm in danger.  Terrible danger.  I want whoever finds this to know that the beast that has terrorized Sevierville for 15 years, is not a beast.  It's a demon.  A powerful demon.  And I messed with the clan that summoned it.  There's no way to stop this thing.  If you try to you will die.

So please burn Sevierville, and burn this forest.

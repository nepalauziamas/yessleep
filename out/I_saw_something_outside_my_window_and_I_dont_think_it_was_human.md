I need help.

It's 11:30 at night here. I should already be asleep. I have school tomorrow but I don't think I'm safe here anymore. For some details, I'm 17. I live with my mom and my younger brother and I'm in twelfth grade, a graduate of '22. School is tight right now and all of my finals are due. Exams are in just a few weeks.

I decided tonight to stay up a bit later to crush some outstanding homework before a presentation tomorrow. It's one of my finals so everything has to go perfectly. Everybody in my house (besides me, obviously) is asleep. I thought they were asleep. This isn't the first time I've stayed up later. I'm a night owl and do a lot more in the dark than I do during the day. Tonight was different. 

It was maybe 10:50 when I decided to go to bed. As much as I'd like to be up later, I don't want to be exhausted tomorrow (because that's the worst). I started packing my stuff and that was when I noticed it. This sound. Not a tapping, or a creaking. Sort of sounded similar to a squeaking sound. 

I became aware when I heard it was frequent. Like a pattern. Originally I'd put it off as the fan in the kitchen - it's been hot outside - until I looked over from my spot. The fan isn't even on. The weird sound is continuing. It's still frequent. No change in pace, or volume. Just a patterned sound. Tap, tap, tap, every 5 to 10 seconds. 

That was enough for me. I plugged in my computer and put everything away where I'd be able to get it easily tomorrow. I started turning out the lights. That was when I noticed him. Out the living room window, a man standing on the lawn. We have a huge property and he was toward the back beside the sidewalk. He was just standing... It was dark, I couldn't see if he was facing the house or not. He was in a white shirt and black pants, he looked like he was dressed pretty fancy to be standing on our lawn. I made a point of watching him for a second. I was uneasy. I decided to lock the window, then I turned out the lights. 

I made my rounds around my house making sure everything was off. I got into the kitchen and saw something else that had me nervous. A second guy, identical to the first, standing in the driveway. Not at the end. He was maybe 20 feet out from the house, and again it was too dark to see. Everything in my body was aching. I KNEW something wasn't right. I decided to go get my mom.

I tried to wake her up but nothing worked. She's alive, she's breathing, but she won't wake up. I don't know what's going on. I tried my younger brother too and had the same response. Everything is so fucked up it doesn't feel real. I pushed it off, I'm seeing things or SOMETHING. Why would there be men on our property at 11 pm, right?

I made sure all the doors were locked. Outside the front door, I saw at least 2 other men in the driveway (a total of 3 guys there now, they're all standing idly. Identical fucking poses.) but I'm not writing this because of them. 

I finally made it back to the kitchen. The kitchen that everything was originally shut down in, except... The light was on and the patio door was open. And there he fucking is. Another one. White button-up shirt, black pants. He's standing in that stupid fucking pose, hands to his side and feet straight, slouched. But now I can see he had no fucking face. I'm not making this shit up. He's facing me with literally no facial features, it's just a slab of skin, nothing there. I can see at least 10 others behind him on the grass and in the driveway, every one got progressively closer. He didn't move. I didn't move. 

Fight or flight kicked in. That door wasn't open before. That light wasn't on before. That fucking guy WAS NOT THERE BEFORE. I ran. I booked it to the bathroom. I locked the door and I cried. 

It's 11:30 in my time now. I hear banging in the kitchen and living room and I know they're in the house. I'm using my phone to post this, sorry if the format is weird or anything, I don't care. I'm scared. My family won't wake up. My phone won't make any calls - I tried, believe me.

That godforsaken sound is back now but on the bathroom door. I turned the lights off and sometimes I hear the doorknob move, I know they know I'm in here. I'm stuck and I'm alone. This is my final idea. I hope this gets to the right place. I hope somebody else went through this too. And I hope somebody can tell me what the fuck to do.

Um, apologies for the link above. I don't know exactly how it works, but I hope it takes you to the right post.

So! I have news. My wife managed to corner the lady across the street at the gym. She's a new mom and apparently is trying to work off the 'post-pregnancy body'. She was in a spin class with my wife and apparently refused to look anywhere in her direction. The gym isn't in our new suburb though, it's closer to the city so everyone else thought she was a bit weird, twisting her neck at awkward angles to avoid my wife who had claimed the last available bike - the one right next to her.

My wife managed to trap her into conversation at the water fountain after the class, and proceeded to have the most enlightening chat we have ever had with our new neighbours. 

She said it went something like this:

Wifey: "Hi Annie*, we haven't met yet but I've heard that congratulations are in order for your new baby!"

Annie: "You moved in across the street."

Wifey: "Yep! My husband and I moved into the 'haunted house', but I'm sure you've heard the rumors."

Annie: "You should leave. You don't look dumb, so I'll cut to the chase. You've noticed that no one in town wants you here. I'm only talking to you now because you clearly won't let me leave until you get some information out of me. So here it is: that house killed it's last tenant. It's not good for anyone who lives there, and as long as you live there, you and your husband - especially your husband - are not welcome."

She shoved past after that, surprisingly strong for a petite woman, and my wife called me immediately to let me know what had gone down. She's still not sure what to make of it, but I must say that part chilled me a little.

Why single me out in particular? 

The agent didn't mention any murders or other dark events that may or may not have occurred in our house, but I'm not sure I can trust her to disclose everything if it would have affected our decision to rent out the place. But that's illegal, right? 

The only other source for info into our house's history  would be the neighbours, and I'm not sure they will give me the real story either.

Regardless, there is something wrong with this town and it seems to center around our house. How could an entire suburb decide to collectively shun new residents with no consequences? Or even one person have the self-awareness to see  that what they're doing is not socially acceptable, or even normal human behavior.

Maybe we've accidentally trespassed into cult territory, I don't know man. But at least we know that they want us to get out. Now all we gotta do it find out why.

In other news, there actually has been strange events occurring within our lovely new house. Nothing to convince me that it's ghosts, stuff that can be explained etc. But I thought that maybe you guys would find them entertaining to read. 

1) I discovered an ominous red stain hidden away in the corner of the kitchen. It had been hidden by the fridge, but I dropped a magnet and it rolled under there. When I moved it, I saw that what looked like red wine (or blood, *le gasp*!) had seeped into the floorboards, irreversibly staining the pale wood a dark red. It wasn't a new stain, you could see the grain of the wood through it quite clearly which makes me think it was a thin liquid, so wine makes the most sense to me. 

2) The claw-foot bathtub actually seems to be fixed to the floor, I can't move it at all. A blow to my ego for sure, but why make something so heavy not able to be moved at all? Maybe there was a plumbing issue? I can't quite find the reasoning behind this one. 

3) Just last night I thought I heard someone moving around above our bedroom, the wooden ceiling was creaking like someone was trying hard not to get caught walking on noisy floorboards. But we don't have an attic and I'm pretty confident that the ceiling wouldn't be able to hold the weight of an adult. So it makes sense to me that it's the wood expanding or shrinking after the heat of the day. Old houses make noises sometimes, it's as simple as that. 

So there you go, nothing too spooky. 

I'll let you guys know what the agent says.


Update:

Okay, so I am currently writing this at 2am on my phone in bed. My wife is asleep and I can hear voices outside. 

It sounds like a man and a woman, but I can't quite tell because they're whispering. It is the creepiest thing I have ever heard.

My first thought was that it could be those horror tourists I mentioned in my first post, but I think they'd be a bit louder due to the anticipation of being at a 'haunted' house. No, I think it's some of the other people on our street.

I swear I mentioned the cult thing as a joke before, but now I'm not so sure.

If they're trying to scare us into leaving, I hate to say it but I think it's working.

How horrible of a person do you have to be to try and make someone feel unsafe in their own house? Because that's how I feel right now.

Unsafe.

If the worst comes to the worst, it's my wife and I against an entire suburb of crazy people who could be capable of anything. And I have to protect her no matter what, she's done so much for me it's the bare minimum of my duty as her husband.

I can hear the whispers moving away from the window and towards the back of the house. I have to follow them to make sure there's no back entrance or secret floorboard trapdoor thing that I don't know about.

What if they killed the previous owner through an entrance that only the permanent residents knew about? What if they prey on tenants who rent out this house, or use them for whatever messed up thing is going on in this place?

They've still been avoiding us, or rather me, on the street. Since she first cornered Annie someone will talk to my wife occasionally, but she says it's always mundane small talk about the weather or something equally as inane. They only ever approach her when she is alone. 

Why are they so wary of me? Why don't they avoid my wife anymore? What if they're trying to turn her against me? I can't live without her. I won't. 

The whispers have stopped now. I think they're gone.

I'm about to go to sleep and see if I get sleep paralysis. This is a story for now until I get a new one if I do have sleep paralysis.



When I was like 7 years old I had two very traumatizing accounts of sleep paralysis. The first one was when I was in my little fetus ages and I was horrified of dinosaurs. Well I wouldn't exactly say horrified, kind of like that sense when you despise something or think that it's disgusting but you're still obsessed with it. Anyway, I felt like I was getting pulled through a wall when it started. There was like hot air breathing on me and this was terrifying because this was my first sleep paralysis experience later after that in the dream I was in my bed. Only my head could move and I was too afraid to get out of bed but too scared not to. I don't know how or if this would count add sleep paralysis afterward or if it was just a nightmare, but I stood up and went down to the kitchen where my family was laying dead on the ground. And then the dinosaur thing came to me again and ate people and then I kind of teleported back to my bed. This went on for multiple weeks and it would happen one week straight for each month and then I would have planned it and so it wasn't scary anymore and thus, I stopped having the dreams.


My second experience was with the shadow thing. About 7 ft tall no distinguishable features like a Big blob of ink. Every time that dream started it would just have me laying in bed with my door wide open which, never happens because I never sleep with my door open. Then I see a shadow approaching in the hallway. It gets closer and closer and closer slowly so that the fear of dread can set in. Then the shadow disappears. And he pops up at the foot of my bed just boom there. And then he holds out something valuable to me. Like a family member or, to my 7 year old brain, a cookie. And he would taunt me to. Saying things when he was holding one of my family members like "you won't even get up to save your family?"and I couldn't because well sleep paralysis. But this one night my dream / sleep paralysis altered. He marked me again like usual and then all of a sudden I leaped at him he dodged me but he turned to me and gave me a look. An evil look, a mischievous look, and a scared look. All combined into one facial expression that I couldn't quite recognize. Then I never had the dream again.


If anybody read this far then I'm going to say congratulations and give you a very short third story. I was laying in my loft bed and this dog walked into my door. The thing is the door was shut before so he opened it himself. And if that's not already sketchy enough he grinned at me razor sharp teeth in his mouth. I thought it was my dog when he had just walked in. But not those teeth. My dog had anything but those teeth. He leaped on my chest, making it super hard to breathe. And then I woke.

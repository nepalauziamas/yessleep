I awoke the next morning on the couch, the remaining platter of the remaining cookies resting on the space between where me and Ma's bodies were. "Ma?" I called out, rubbing my eyes and yawning. As my eyes continued to adjust, I began looking around the living room for Ma when I heard indistinct voices coming from the dining room. When I walked in, I was greeted to my folks sitting at the table, still in their bed clothes, talking with officer Hagan and two of the others that I didn't recognize.

Anxiety wasted no time building up inside me in that moment when I saw Ma's horrified face cuddled into Dad's embrace. "Wh-What's going on?" I asked, my knees beginning to shake like there was a category 5 earthquake was rumbling through me.

"Everything's okay, son. Why don't you go paly your PlayStation for a while? We'll talk afterwards when it's just us three, okay?"

"Actually sir," officer Hagan piped up, turning to me, "I'd like to ask your son a few questions in private."

"What, why?" Ma squeaked out, "He isn't under any suspicion, is he?"

"I don't think so." he replied, still facing me with a concentrated stare. "No, we're just trying to figure out what the apparent link is between your son here and the attack on this young lady."

*Attack?! Young lady?!* I shuddered as my thoughts were sent reeling back to the previous night. Dad looked to Ma before nodding to officer Hagan. "Wait, what're you talking about?!" I exclaimed, anxiety shooting through me from all angles.

"If you'll follow me, we'll explain." officer Hagan replied, gathering the photos. I followed him upstairs and into my room while the other two officers remained in the kitchen with Ma and Dad. I sat on my bed, facing the wall, as officer Hagan sat in front of me and began laying out the photos on my bed. "Now, uh... Linus, is it? I want you to take a good look at these." He nudged two of the photos closer to me on the bed. Picking up one of them, I could feel my stomach begin to grind and churn.

It was a photo of Liza. She was tied to a chair, beaten and badly bruised everywhere from what I could see in the photo and gagged with a rainbow colored cloth and she even had the red tear drop design painted around her eyes and mouth. I began to shiver, my body starting to feel extremely cold like someone had turned the thermostat all the way down.

*"... Now WE'RE gonna have some playtime with her..."*

"Sickening, isn't it?" officer Hagan asked.

I responded with an almost on-cue dry retch. the back of this particular photo read, ***"See how much fun our little playmate is having?"*** beside it was a cartoon smiley face drawn in red. Out of, I guess, morbid instinct, I actually found myself  picking up *another* one. *(So many photos. One photo = one more vivid nightmare for years to come...)*

This one was of Mr. Cromwell, propped up in a chair lifelessly next to Liza. His face was painted the same as hers. On the back of this one read, ***"How sweet, Daddy-Daughter bonding time!"***

I then saw that the next one was a close-up of Mr. Cromwell's face, now having had the demented grin I see every time I would ever close my eyes carved into his face. This one read, ***"Family resemblance?"*** This one also had a red smiley face drawn next to it.

The most sickening one, however -- the one that forced me to finally fully succumb to nausea -- was a photo showing Liza, clearly crying though her cloth gag, holding a blood splattered *Louisville slugger* in her hands while standing next to her mother. Mrs. Cromwell appeared to have been forcefully stripped down to her underwear and bound by her wrists to the ceiling fan above her. I could see cuts and bruises covering just about every square inch of her body. As well as this, her ribs appeared to be stoved almost completely inwards and her shoulders were dislocated and forced back at an angle I'd never even seen or known of before.

The worst part of it, though, was her face. Well, let me clarify and say, what was *identifiable* of it. She, too, had the red clown face painted over her eyes and mouth, which was hanging open numbly and appeared to hang to one side, obviously broken. And to top it all off, there was a gruesome bloody gash visible on the left side of her head. The back of this one read, ***"What's a party without a pi√±ata? Took her a few extra whacks, but eventually, the old bag broke! HA, HA, HA!"***

My breath became heavy. "Oh God, Liza..." I muttered before burying my face into my hands.

"I need you to be straight with me, bud, because people have gotten *hurt* now. Possibly even worse. So I need you to tell me, right now, *anything* you might know as to who's doing this and why."

"I... I..." I began stammering. My thoughts were scrambled so much that I couldn't even begin to form a coherent thought, much less try explaining everything about the clowns to him.

"Who do you think would want to hurt you?" he pressed, to which I basically responded by tightly closing my eyes and shaking my head. I was desperately trying to filter out the horrific moment in the "[Balloon](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/n7g6ra/a_survivors_accounts_of_the_depraved_funhouse_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) Room" of HappyWorld and the shit from the photos. "Wh-When did this happen?" I asked meekly.

"Shortly after we brought you home, when we were waiting on your folks." My stomach continued to turn over on itself. I couldn't stop myself from remembering the sirens and the urgent radio calls.

"I-Is... Is she alright?" I sputtered, heart sinking lower and lower into my stomach.

Officer Hagan was quiet for a moment, making me fear all the more what he'd tell me, before answering, "She's alive, but she's hurt pretty bad."

"Can I go see her?!" I blurted out. Again, he paused with this, furrowing his brow at me.

"That would be up to your folks. Right now, though, I need to know who these people are and why they targeted this young lady specifically." I felt my Adam's apple twitch in my throat.

"It... It's... It's my fault!"

"What do you mean?"

"It's *me* they want."

"Who and why?" I put my palms over my eyes and drew in a deep breath, shuddering.

*Just tell the truth, damn it!*

*("What if he doesn't believe me?")*

*Just do it!*

*(God... Why didn't I listen?)*

Pulling out the defaced memorial photo of Derek from my pocket, I was about to begin recounting the horrors of HappyWorld when I noticed a series of rapidly blinking flashes coming from an opening in my closet door. I began to feel an even bigger tidal wave of dread flood ferociously throughout my body. *What the fuck?*

"What is it?" he asked, evidently noticing the fright molded into my fade in that moment. I just looked over to the closet and pointed. He looked over and squinted his eyes before getting up from my bed. I shielded my eyes as he opened the closet door. The flashing intensified. For a moment, I felt like I was back in HappyWorld again. The strobe light blinding me while the air was being ripped straight from my lungs. The pounding of the sledgehammer just inches behind me...

*"Gonna rip... your... guts out!"*

"It's alright, you can come out now." Being jolted back to reality, I found that, during my little episode, I'd unwittingly buried myself under my covers. I slowly uncovered my head to find him standing in front of the open closet, inspecting what looked to be a small camera. "This thing was set on a repeating timer." He then began to open the back of the camera. "Out of film, too. Any idea how this got here?" Still in a state of pure shock, I shook my head at him.

"No, look, can I *please* go now?" I urged, unsure my mind or body could take anymore of the immediate turmoil. That's when I heard footsteps coming up the stairs. One of the other officers then opened up and asked to speak to officer Hagan in the hallway. He nodded and followed him out, closing the door and leaving me with the photos.

Ten minutes later, they came back in and gathered the photos, telling me I could come downstairs with my parents. I obliged and when I reached the dining room, I saw that Ma was huddled into Dad's arms with the most horrified expression on her face that I'd ever seen -- from her, as well as anybody else. "M-Mom, what's going on?" I stammered. Already, my anxiety was once again spiking through the roof. She didn't respond, continuing to gaze in terror at the photo laying in front of her on the table.

My heart nearly stopped dead in my chest when I saw that it was a snapshot of my mother in the kitchen. It, despite it being taken from outside the kitchen window, was somehow still close enough to fully capture her face -- which had been defaced like the others had with the red clown face. My hands started to shake again as I turned this one over. "Wh-Where did this come from?"

On the back, it read, ***"Will mommy dearest let the little piggy come out to play? No... Well, guess we'll just have to make do with her!"***

My whole body went completely numb right then as I imagined Ma being the one strung up to the ceiling, repeatedly being battered like a...

Like a...

*"... Eventually the old bag broke..."*

I all but launched myself like a rocket into Ma, wrapping my arms around her so tightly that, looking back, I'm almost surprised I didn't break her in half in that moment. "Are there any relatives nearby you could possibly stay with for a while?" officer Hagan asked. Dad shook his head, wrapping his own arms around me and Ma.

"No, they're all in another state."

"Then I'd recommend you folks check yourselves into a hotel somewhere for a few days while we scout the neighborhood. We'll give you a holler when we see that it's safe."

"Understood." Dad replied. With that, the officers left. After they did, the three of us spent the next fifteen minutes or so semi-scrambling to pack a few necessary things for the time we'd be away. WE, of course, just settled on throwing together light baggage, figuring you know, we'd actually be back home after just a few days and things would maybe go back to what they were *before* this whole shitstorm.

Once we'd all piled in the car, we drove for about half an hour to look for a hotel we could possibly afford to stay in for a few days. As we drove along, I began to notice something flashing. "What the--" Dad said, trying to shield his eyes while keeping control of the car. "Who is this guy flashing at?"

I, too, was confused. It was still only early afternoon -- the sun was on full display. I turned around in the back seat, squinting my eyes, and I saw that it was a bicycle tailing behind us. I was two seconds from becoming hysterical. *Oh God, No... No, please...*

Dad slowed down, probably thinking the person was trying to pass. I almost lost my shit then. I was already undoing my seat belt and was about to throw myself forward into the driver's seat when I actually saw the flashing bike pass right by us. When I looked ahead, still expecting to see the clown chick from before, I was surprised to see that it wasn't a clown at all. It was just some regular guy on his bike. For whatever reason, I saw that the bike was fitted with some kind of reflective tape that made it flash in the sunlight. "Damn kid," Dad quipped, annoyed, "Could've caused an accident with that shit."

Despite this, it was still a full minute or more before my heartrate could somewhat steady itself out. By this point, you can only imagine the nausea I felt the rest of the way to the hotel. In fact, the first thing I actually did when we arrived was run like hell to the bathroom to empty out my stomach, even though I hadn't even eaten anything all morning. "Honey, are you okay?" Ma asked when she saw me come out of the lobby restroom.

I didn't respond. I didn't have the energy or mental stability at the time to answer. I was tired. I just wanted to lay down. To be done with the day and the whole disaster in general. *(Wanting to run away...)*

Dad got us checked into a room on the ground floor and we moved in. Clearly, I wasn't the only one drained by the stress to the point where, not even bothering with unpacking the luggage, they were passed out on the bed as soon as they entered the room. Me and Dad, both, were out like busted lightbulbs. Ma, I guess, though, was too spooked to sleep. Not that I could blame her. Really, I'm a bit surprised I wasn't wide awake with her.

They were after her. They were coming for her, the same way they went after Liza. *All because of me...*

*Why? Why do they want ME?!*

This is honestly a question that carried on with me for the next few days. It was something I'd even wondered about before as well. I guess, in a way, it was part of the reason I couldn't ever answer anybody as to just *who* the hell these freaks were. I truly just *didn't know*.

In any event, though, I remember how I wasn't asleep long. I woke up, I'd say about 20 minutes later, to see Ma watching TV. Her face was still as worried, as frightened, as it was when we'd gotten here. The TV was on some Cooking show. That'd always been sort of a weird little comfort for her. Anytime she'd be stressed, she'd cut on the TV and instantly turn to a cooking show. They'd usually somehow lull her to sleep after a while.

Of course, this time, it didn't have that effect with her. What's almost funny is that, especially since I began writing this out, I've found myself doing much the same thing. *(And just like here, it hasn't done a damn thing for me. In either case, apple ain't falling too far from the tree, I guess...)*

I snuggled next to her. She didn't make any move at first, almost like she didn't notice I was even there. Her eyes stayed deadlocked on the TV. Silent and motionless.

"M-Mom?" I asked softly. She didn't acknowledge me. I asked again, a little louder this time. "Mom?" Nothing.

I wasn't sure what to do from there. I wanted to ask her if she'd take me to the hospital. I wanted -- no, I *needed* \-- to see Liza. I needed to know if she was okay. At the same time, though, I guess I couldn't exactly blame my mother for not wanting to leave the hotel. At least there, you know, *she* was relatively safe.

*They're after her...* This thought made me curl up again against her side, hugging her arm. *They're out there and they're after her. How will I see them coming? They've been able to evade the police even after all this time, how the hell are we supposed to stay safe from them?*

*How the hell was I supposed to stay safe from them?*

I let the silence hang for about another three or four minutes before I tried asking again. "Ma, c-can we go to the hospital?" This time, she actually broke from the TV to look at me. She no longer looked so much worried as she did more so confused.

"The hospital? Why do you wanna go there, honey, what's wrong?"

"It's not for me, Mom. I wanna make sure Liza's okay." Her face then fell back into one of worry. "Please Mom, I have to see if she's okay."

"That's sweet of you, Linus, it really is, but we need to stay here where it's safe as much as we can."

"But Mom, she's hurt because of me." I protested, knowing good and damn well that I wasn't gonna win this arguement. She *did* have a point, and I knew it -- even back then.

"Sweetheart, I'm not going to argue with you, okay? I know you wanna see if your friend's okay, but right now, it's too dangerous to go outside." I could hear agitation building in her voice as she said this to me. I could tell it was everything she could do to not just go hysterical at me.

"But mom--"

"Enough, Linus!" she snapped. I shrank down, knowing I'd pushed too much. "I'm sorry, but the answer is no! I know you wanna do what you think is right and yes, I *am* worried about that little girl. Hell, I hope she *is* okay, given everything she's lost now. But goddamn it, *you're* my son, *MY CHILD,* and I'm *not* gonna put you in danger just over her, okay?! *YOU* still have your mother to protect you, and she doesn't! Do you *want* to be without that?!"

My eyes went wide. "W-W-Without?" I stammered, quivering. Ma's own face then dissolved into one of realization. Obviously, she'd slipped up without meaning to. She must've meant to keep Mr. and Mrs. Cromwell's deaths to herself. From there, Ma melted into tears again, burying her face in her palms.

Seeing this made me want to break down and cry with her. I didn't want to be without her. That's why I was scared. But at the same time, I knew I couldn't just up and forget about Liza. It's my fault she was now both in the hospital *and an orphan! (Not even when I fucking wanted to...)*

"I'm sorry, Mom." I whimpered. "I don't wanna anything to happen to you. I need you. I just want Liza to be okay, too." She looked up at me. I could tell she wanted to see my point of view, even if I could also see hers. In other words, we both had a point, but neither of us could agree on what the right decision was; whether to stay put or try to make sure Liza was okay.

Dad woke up soon after and asked what was going on. I quickly filled him in. He exchanged looks between me and Ma. Sighing, he said "Your mother has a point, son. We don't know who these people are, and you won't tell us." I lowered my head, defeated. "However," he said, looking to Ma, "I *can* understand that he's only wanting to do the right thing, aren't you, sport?"

I looked up, nodding. "Yeah, I just wanna know that she's okay."

"Here's what we'll do then. Linus, get dressed. I'm going to take you for a *short* visit." I could see Ma about to speak out in protest, but dad held up his hand, stopping her. "Just long enough to make sure she's gonna be okay. Then I'll bring you back and we'll stay here until officer Hagan says the house is safe to come back. Sound fair?"

I looked to Ma. I could tell she wasn't on board with the idea at all. "I promise, dear, I'll be with him the entire time." Dad said. To this, she finally lowered her head, relenting. I did as I was told and got dressed. Afterwards, we headed out.

On the way out of the room, I heard Ma call out, "I love you, *please* be safe!" Dad replied that we would and to lock the door. It was about a 10-20 minute drive from the hotel to the hospital and I spent pretty much the entire time in a complete daze.

I couldn't stop wondering what state she'd be in when I saw her. Hell, would I even be able to see her? What if she'd passed by the time we got there? I wondered, too, if she *was* still alive, would she be able to even talk to me? More than that, though, would she even *want* to.

*"You KNEW!"* Those words echoed in my head. *(They still do...) "I HATE YOU!"*

*Liza, I'm so sorry! Please be okay!*

When we pulled into the hospital parking lot, it was everything I could do to not just throw open the door and make a mad dash inside. Dad got out and the two of us walked together to the front desk and asked for Liza's room. "Name?" the receptionist asked.

"James Davies." Dad replied. "And this is my son, Linus." I watched the receptionist type our names on the keyboard.

"And are you kin to the patient?" she asked.

"No ma'am," I said, "Liza's a friend of mine from the neighborhood and I heard she was here. I would like to see if she's okay." The receptionist gave me the plastic smile that already told me what she was going to say.

"I'm sure she'd appreciate the thought, however, I'm afraid we can't let you in to see her without parental or legal consent." I looked to Dad. Truthfully, I don't know why, looking back. What the hell was *he* gonna be able to do?

He confirmed this when he gave me his own look that said "Sorry, kiddo, no can do". I hung my head down. Dad patted my shoulder and said, "Come on, son, I'm sure she'll be okay. You'll be able to see her again when she's out of the hospital."

I turned and was about to head out with Dad when I stopped and turned back toward the receptionist and asked, "Is she?" For a moment, the receptionist looked at me, puzzled. "Okay, I mean. Is she... you know..." The receptionist smiled again.

"That's very sweet, young man. Yes, she is. That's all I'm at liberty to share."

"Okay, thank you." She nodded at me before returning to her computer. Me and Dad left after that. As we were heading out to the car, however, I saw something that instantly killed any sort of relief I *might've* built up.

It was a bicycle. A bright, sunny yellow bicycle and the side of it was painted that all too familiar smile. My eyes widened and I stopped.

*Oh God, No...* At first, I tried to convince myself maybe I was just seeing things. You know how when your mind is so fixated on something, especially if it's traumatizing, you'll start thinking you're seeing or hearing things related to it? "P.T.S.D.", right?

Well, that's what I *hoped* it was. But when I actually went and took a closer look, nope, not an illusion. It was real. It was *them, their bike!*

They were in the hospital! *Oh no, LIZA!*

"Linus, what's wrong?" I heard my Dad ask. I didn't answer. Instead, I instantly broke into a sprint back into the hospital. My mind was a complete blur. I halfway wasn't even aware I was running or where the hell I was even going. I sure as hell didn't know what I was even planning to do if I *did* actually run into one of the clowns. I didn't care, though.

I was a dog chasing a car. I had one goal and one goal only on my mind. I *had* to get to Liza before they did, no matter what. In the hallway, I saw a petite young woman with red hair talking to the receptionist. She had almost milky white skin and her hair was almost the color of a crayon. Even before she actually turned and winked at me, I knew exactly who it was. It was the bicycle clown. She didn't have any makeup on, but damn it, I knew it was her and I knew where she was headed. I had ton stop her before she did.

To my credit, I actually managed to make it all the way in and through the lobby before two of the security guards had me by my arms and were dragging me back to the front door. "Wait!" I cried. "You have to let me go! She's in danger!"

It did me no good to struggle or plead, though. They weren't gonna let me go and their grips on my shoulders might as we have been that of a bear trap's. Dad was in the lobby, having tried to chase after me. "Son, what the hell were you doing?!" he exclaimed.

"Dad, it's them! They're here and their trying to get Liza!"

"Who, Linus? *WHO'S* after her?"

I squinted my eyes. My head felt on the verge of exploding. *"The clowns!"* I cried. Dad just stood there, dumbfounded.

"The what?" he asked.

"The clowns, Dad. They're after me and her. One of them was on a bicycle, chasing after me yesterday. Now she's here!" He just blinked at me. "Look, please, Dad, you *have* to believe me!"

"Son, calm down, okay." He stepped forward, outstretching his hand to me.

"No, Dad!" I exclaimed, reeling away from him. "I *have* to get to her before they do!"

"Son it's time to go. We need to--"

"Damn it, why won't you listen to me!" I cried. His eyes grew in shock. I, myself, winced. I'd never talked back to either of my folks like this -- *FAR* less actually *cursed* at them. I stood frozen. I didn't want to move. *Not until I knew Liza was safe.*

Unfortunately, I'd get absolutely no sort of say in the matter because Dad immediately, and firmly, jerked me by my arm and more or less dragged me out of the hospital. "Let me go!" I screamed, pitifully struggling against Dad's gorilla grip. Finally, he stopped and positioned me to face him. His face was one of what I can only accurately describe as sheer anxiety.

"Linus, that's enough, okay?"

"But Dad, we can't just--"

"*I SAID THAT'S ENOUGH!"* he shrieked. My body went limp. All the desire to resist was gone. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath. "Look, son," he said, "We're gonna go back to the hotel room now, and we're not going to be leaving it again unless *absolutely necessary* until officer Hagan says we can come home. That's all there is to it, okay? I don't wanna hear any more about Liza, or these "clowns" of yours, got it?"

"But..." I started. I wanted so badly to plead my case, to tell him that I was telling the truth and that Liza was in very real danger. His almost frightening look of agitation quickly shot that thought in the back of its head and my head dropped. "Y-Y-Yes... Yes sir." I said, my voice breaking.

*I only wanted to help.*

*(Like how I "helped" Derek...)*

*"Linus... Run!"*

The whole car ride back to the hotel room was tense, to say the least. Actually, being more accurate, I'd describe it as "surreal". Like with everything else that went on, none of this shit felt like it could possibly be real. I was honestly halfway waiting for the point where I'd wake up from this... *Whatever* this was.  *(The point where I'd be able to forget...)*

For the 45 minutes or so I spent in the backseat on the way back to the hotel, I was locked in a state of entropy. Emptiness. It was like a lightswitch to my brain had been flipped and now, there was absolutely nothing. Nothing, except for the voices from that day in HappyWorld.

\*\*\*

*"Do you care for this boy's life?"*

*"Please... Just let us go..."*

*"Uh, oh, somebody's not happy..."*

*"...I think the little piggy needs a balloon! Would you like that, piggy?"*

*(God no, please... Not this!)*

***"Would you like a balloon!"***

\*\*\*

I was brought back to reality when I heard Dad calling my name, for what must've been the third or fourth time, given the slight aggravation in his voice (he never *was* one to like repeating himself, and that was *without* incidents like at the hospital). "Huh?" I said.

"Come on, we're back." He then got out and made his way back in the hotel. I followed very slowly behind him. When we got back to the room, we found Ma sitting in front of the TV. Now, however, it wasn't on a cooking show. In its place now was a breaking news broadcast.

"Hey, hon, what's--" Dad was cut off when Ma held up her hand, silencing him. On the screen read the headline **"Abduction in local Tennessee hospital."** Instantly, my attention was fixed on the screen.

A man was on screen saying "Just a half hour ago, authorities were alerted to a disturbance in the downtown hospital." My heart began hammering.

"Authorities are currently in the process of securing the patients and medical staff. Sources have claimed that at least two doctors, two security personell, and a receptionist have all been killed, with possibly more having been critically wounded, and that one of the patients has been confirmed to have been kidnapped. The missing patient was confirmed to be 10 year old Liza Cromwell, who was in the ICU at the time of her abduction."

The footage showed the struggle in the lobby area. I watched as a woman with bright, crayon red hair -- *THE* girl with red hair -- went ballistic, pulling out a knife from her pocket and viciously stabbing the receptionist in the throat before doing the same to the two security guards who'd stopped me before. I couldn't believe it. I.. I just *couldn't!*

*The hospital... But... But we were JUST THERE!*

I was right, and now Liza was gone. Taken to do only God knew what with. I wanted to save her.

*(It was all my fault!)*

"At this time," the reporter continued, now displaying the faces of Liza and the bicycle clown girl, "Authorities are actively searching for Liza Cromwell. Reports have deduced her kidnapper to be that of Francine Withers, who's priors include Aggravated assult, Assault with a deadly weapon, and felony drug possession. Authorities have advised that, if spotted, do not attempt to engage the suspect. They've advised instead to call the number on the screen immediately to alert authorities with the location as well as the license plate numbers of the vehicle. I repeat, if you spot or have any knowledge on the whereabouts of either Francine or her captive, please dial the number on your screen immediately. We'll be updating on the situation as it develops."

"Oh my God." Ma said. "What're we gonna do?"

"We can't. There's nothing we can do except to stay here until we get the call saying it's okay to return to the house." Ma turned then from Dad to me.

"Linus, honey, are you okay?" she asked. I didn't reply. Truth be told, looking back, I honestly can't even remember really hearing her. I was just *that* tuned out from everything around me. My mind was blank. Empty. I was only pulled out of this trance when I felt Ma shaking me, calling out my name. "Linus! Speak to me, are you okay?!"

"I... I... I was trying to... They.... They got her..." That was all I had the capacity to say before I just up and blacked out. That was it. My brain had hit its breaking point and it just couldn't take anymore, so it just cut out. Obviously, I can't really say just how long I was actually out. I do remember, however, that when I *did* wake up again, it was pitch dark outside. Ma and Dad were fast asleep on either side of me.

I just laid there. I couldn't move. I still felt really loopy, the way you might feel coming off of a roller coaster. My body felt extremely stiff as well, like bricks of lead had been stuffed inside each of my limbs. I stared at the ceiling.

*What am I going to do?* I began to wonder. *What CAN I do? I can't just sit here, can I? I have to save Liza. But how?*

Despite my body's refusal to move, my head was swimming, agitated. I wanted to do something. I *needed* to do something. But what?

The longer I looked up at the ceiling, the more I could faintly hear the kids from my nightmares again.

\*\*\*

"Smile for us!"

*No, go away!*

"Smile, for us! Smile for Satan!"

*Stop it!*

*"Now we'll both smile forever, Linus!"* Derek's voice blended in with the cacophony around. All of the disembodied voices all just surrounded me, with Derek's taking center stage. Then, from amid the chaos, I began to hear Liza screaming.

*"Help me! Linus! Save me!"*

This, and everything else soon dissolved away behind a chorus of crazed laughter. I shook my head furiously, but it was no good. I couldn't get any of it out of my head.

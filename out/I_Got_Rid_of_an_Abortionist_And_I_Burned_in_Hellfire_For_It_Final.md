Have you ever had a dream where you were falling? That feeling of leaving your stomach elsewhere as you hurdle downwards.

I recalled reaching out and upwards as Uriel’s form vanished before me, shrinking away further and further as I felt myself falling.

No!

No, I couldn't burn in Hell!

I was a good woman, a God-fearing woman! I defended the innocent, and maybe I wasn’t saving souls, but even an Angel of God said they preferred if the vessels weren’t destroyed!

Why was I being cast down just because my son’s friends pressured him into doing what he had done?

My stomach, somewhere above, felt as if it dropped again at that horrific thought.

Before I could even react to the feeling, I felt my back break as I struck something!

I cried out in pain as I rebounded from whatever I had smashed upon and tumbled down what felt like a grassy hill.

Finally, I stopped. My back felt broken, my legs and knees battered and bruised, my head spinning.

I attempted to push myself up from the firm ground but gasped as shooting pains ripped through my body from my spine!

Somehow, in the chaos, I had lost a shoe. A sick sensation came over me, however, as I realized my foot was facing the wrong way!

I tried to reach out to fix it, my eyes widening in terror as I realized my entire lower half was facing the wrong way!

I painfully clawed at my hips, gasping as I realized my spine hadn’t broken. It had twisted around! It was possibly even turned around more than once!  

I let out a shriek of terror and I felt a blind panic take over as I turned and tried to crawl away from the terrible sight. As if moving away would somehow fix the problem.

These weren't rational thoughts: I know damn well that I was grievously injured, but what else could I do?  

My panic eventually eased enough for me to realize that I wasn’t the only one screaming. I turned over my shoulder and my eyes widened in horror.

Like a scene out of one of Jeremy's terrible video games, bodies were piled high in a massive writhing pile behind me.

I shook, tears running down my cheek as I saw people trying to claw their way out and away from the pile. Not one of them was dead or even dying, despite their horrific wounds and crushed faces.  Blood oozed from the base of the human mound and I wretched at the stench that came off of it.

My stomach churned once more as I felt a horrific pain in my spine again.

I could only throw my head back and scream as it felt like someone had grabbed hold of my spine and was twisting it once again!

My hips and legs flung along with my spine, slowly straightening out. Every nerve ending and sensation is fully aware and alive. The pain was indescribable, as if someone had wired my entire body to an electrical outlet, yet I wasn’t granted the pleasure of blacking out. 

Mercifully, the pain diminished, or at least ebbed, after a few minutes. I lay there gasping, trying to catch my breath.  

That’s when I began to sob.

I was not in the fires of Hell for more than a few moments and I felt more pain than I had in my entire lifetime and there was an eternity to go!

I slammed my fists on the ground beneath me as I stared at the stone ceiling above, sobbing as I saw the flickering of red flames lighting the cavern overhead between my tear-filled cries.

Finally, I sat up, whimpering as I did so. I tried to take in my environment, avoiding the giant body pile before me.  

I spotted people wandering around, all confused and appearing in various states of dress and despair.  

That’s when I saw some terrorist-looking prick start shouting at another man, “I-I do not understand!” He cried, “I lived for Allah! I got rid of the Crusaders for the Great Allah!”

My anger boiled over at this point. I was thrown into the fire with the likes of terrorists, murders and rapists?! “Fuck you, heathen!” I screamed. 

I had startled the bewildered man the Arab was shouting at. Despite this, the Arab man’s gaze was fixed, hatefully, on me. I growled, thinking that there was no point in being pleasant. I was already in Hell: How much worse could my situation get? “You deserve to burn in Hellfire!” I screamed, “But not me! I don’t deserve it! I was a good, honest Christian woman! With good morals!” I paused as I recalled what Jeremy  had done, “I saved babies!”

The startled man narrowed his honey brown eyes on me, “Well, you’re down here for a reason, bitch! How the fuck did you *"save babies*?!” 

I glared at him and I could tell he was some Liberal jackass trying to hold one over on me, “I helped get rid of a doctor who performed abortions on innocent babies!” I screamed, “What’s more Christian than that?!”

To my shock, the Arab came to my defense. “A noble effort, even coming from a whore heathen like you!”

I felt a strange crawling on my skin and my fists clenched. *He* called *me* a heathen?! “Well, you’re here too, asshole! Let me guess: You killed for *Allah*?” I hissed at him.

“Yes!” The Arab man looked downright proud as he spoke, “But I only killed heathens! I strapped a bomb to my chest and burned a church of crusaders to the ground!” He declared, “And I died a hero, a true martyr!”

The liberal made a sarcastic motion to where we were, an exasperated look on his face, “I think *Allah* took offense to that, genius!”

I had to admit, I really hated the smugness of these sorts of people, “Hey, what about you, *asshole?*” I called out, pointing to him, “Why the fuck are *you* here, huh? Mr. Holier-Than-Thou?! Those among us without sin should cast the first stone!” I called out.

The Arab, my unlikely ally against this man, shouted, “Yes! Why *are* you here?! I am certain I know why! But please, tell us how such a *pious* man reached this dark place?”

The man appeared to have his hand caught in the cookie jar, looking somewhat guilty, “I-I accidentally killed a guy with a rock at a protest.”

I scoffed, crossing my arms over my chest, “Typical fucking Liberal shitbag-” I was interrupted as a dark shadow descended over me.

I turned, glancing up to see what had caused it, only moments before sharp talons grabbed at my waist and lifted me off the ground.  

I tried to see what had grabbed me and I could only see a pair of small leg-like appendages attached to an otherwise hulking body! Its long and horrific toes had cracked black claws, each twiddling excitedly.

My shoulders and hips were gripped by massive arms, with colossal talon-clad hands holding me firmly in its grip. “Let me down!” I screamed.

The creature hissed, “*If mortal wishes… The ground the mortal goes.”*

I worried that, perhaps, it was going to drop me. Instead, it circled the people I had been arguing with and roughly landed, pressing my body against the ground.

I looked out at the bewildered men staring at me in the clutches of this beast. I tried to shout, but the horrible thing opened its snaggle-toothed mouth to speak again. Its teeth were so disorderly and I think two of its large lower canines reached its eyes.

*“Fresh mortals to devour,”* the creature hissed out, glaring down at me, its glowing green eyes and red lips turned up into a sinister grin, “*How… Delicious.”* 

I felt the claws grab hold of me tightly just before I saw its massive arms flex. My spine was at its limit and I realized it was trying to rip me in half!

“No, no, no!” I screamed bloody murder at the creature, “Oh God, please, forgive me!” I shrieked in pain and panic as my body was torn in two!

Despite this, I could still feel the pain in my lower half as the creature crushed my hips in its mighty talons. There was no break in the pain, no loss of my faculties. I felt everything! The blood was oozing from my midsection. I felt the pain of my intestines spilling out and snapping as the creature pulled my lower half from my upper body.  

“Oh my God!” I cried in pain, tears streaming down my face as the thing mutilated me, “It hurts!” 

I watched in abject horror as the massive demonic thing brought my lower half up to its enormous maw, “*Welcome, to* ***eternal*** *damnation."* It hissed to me before it chomped down on my leg.

I felt it and I struggled, watching my flailing leg get ripped and chewed up inside this creature’s mouth! I felt every tooth stabbing, every bit of stinging saliva entering the fresh wounds. Even as it swallowed, despite my leg being nothing but mangled flesh, I could feel the acid of its stomach burning my flesh.

It was eating me alive! “Oh, God!” I screamed, looking out to them, hoping one of them might stop this, “I can feel it! I can still feel my leg! I feel him eating me!” I howled in pain, “Please, Jesus, save me!” 

The cowards all ran.

I whimpered as they ran into the distance, “Y-You bastards!” I screamed, unsure if they heard me.

“*Shame,”* the horrific creature chuckled as it bit down and chewed on my other leg.

I whimpered and cried out in pain as it did so.

The creature turned to me, grinning and spitting chunks of my flesh out of its fetid mouth, “*Oh… You look famished. Want some?”* It chortled sickly as it ground my hips up in its mouth. 

I tried to vomit but could only wretch, nothing in my stomach as the creature chuckled, a long finger reaching up into my severed body cavity.

“*What other morsels do you have… mmm… Liver!”* The Creature growled happily.

That’s when a familiar voice called out, though not the voice I ever wanted to hear, “Eurynomus… Please, you’re being awfully rude to our guest.” 

I glanced up, shaking in pain, as I spotted Uphir, “W-What are you doing?”

“Stop fiddling about in that poor woman’s insides,” Uphir said, shooing the massive creature away from me.    

It hissed at him, “*Doctor… I was in the middle of eating that one…*” the giant demon Eurynomus hissed at Uphir.

“Go fetch another from the pile then,” Uphir said, looking around, “Where’s the other bit of her?”

Eurynomus gave a loud belch. I whimpered in pain as more acid ate away at my lower limbs inside the monster’s belly.

“Fine, fine, I’ll make due,” Uphir said, flicking his hand at the beast before it finally released me and shambled off towards the pile of bodies. “My sincerest apologies,” Uphir said, looking down at me with a condescending grin, “I had meant to greet you but, well, sadly, you fell sooner than I thought. You irritated Uriel with that assessment of soul worth,” he chuckled, “Oh but was he in rare form.”

“H-He can’t be an angel of God… He was so cruel!” I gasped, groaning in pain still.

Uphir nodded, looking up, “Oh, we all know Uriel. He’s judged all of us at some point or another. It’s rare when someone has to face him that they go upwards. One must be of unparalleled worth to do so,” Uphir taunted as he shook his head, “Of course, there are some who have taken the life of another who come straight here. The weight of taking an innocent life is difficult to remove. Some say it rends the soul,” Uphir bent down and pulled out a sack from his pocket, wrapping my midsection in it.

I winced in pain as a searing sensation came over my opened wound.  

“Afraid that can’t be helped, my dear,” Uphir said, clearly enjoying this as he hefted me up and under his large arm, “You’ll find, over time, that there isn’t much difference between Angels and those of us labeled as *Demons.*”

I gasped, speaking only to distract myself from the pain wracking my mind and body, “Y-you act like you’re not proud to be a demon.”

“Oh, I dislike that term so much. I am a Fallen Angel,” Uphir explained as he took to the air, “Cast down for siding with Lord Lucifer over some… Let's call them administrative differences.” 

I gasped as we flew, feeling my insides press against the rough fabric holding me together, “T-The literal devil… I-I’m sure he wanted everything to burn.”

Uphir’s smile faded, his eyes fixed, “Oh little mortal… If you knew the truth, you’d likely dissolve into nothing at the mere thought.”

My stomach, or something inside of me, churned as I saw the dead serious expression on Uphir’s face.  

“I’ll say this: Those of us down here believed that Lucifer’s cause was noble,” Uphir turned to me, still a serious expression on his face, “Because it was.” 

“T-then why torture us,” I whimpered.

“Honestly?” Uphir’s expression turned back into a heinous smile as we landed, “Spite.”

I swallowed hard as Uphir walked into a filthy-looking hospital-like building. The paint was chipped and peeled off the walls, with rusted bars separating the few rooms from the rest of the hallway as we passed through them, “W-What is this?”

“My hospital,” Uphir grinned at me, “Where I patch up those who suffer grievous injury.”  He laughed, “Though usually, I find myself spending most of my time performing research.”

“R-Research?” I stammered.

“Yes,” Uphir laughed as we reached a large barred door that opened with all the grace of a classroom dragging their nails across a mile-long chalkboard, “You’re going to be my little assistant,” Uphir appeared deep in thought for a moment, “Or subject… Either way, you’ll be assisting in the research,” he laughed sickly as he dropped me unceremoniously down onto the table.

I gasped as he strapped my shoulders, head and arms down. He even tied my midsection down as I yelped in pain.

Still, I could feel my legs. Still, they burned and boiled in that monster’s belly!

Uphir laughed, “Now… What shall we do to fix you up? Obviously, Eurynomus is keen on keeping your legs as dinner, so we’ll need some replacements. Let me see what we have in stock,” Uphir hummed as he rummaged around the room.

I could hear horrible scraping and grinding noises and the sounds of different animals calling out in distress.

“Hmm… Hmmm!” Uphir’s tone shifted to excitement, “Oh, yes! Perfect and ironic, I think! What with all your scheming on the mortal plane!"

“S-Scheming?! W-What are you doing?” I demanded.

“Oh now, dear sweet Charity,” Uphir chuckled as I heard a hissing noise followed by a loud thump.  Under my table, black blood was pooling from where the thud had occurred, “I’m not going to spoil the surprise.”

I was shaking as Uphir removed the cloth from my lower half.

“Now, you’re going to feel an utterly horrific amount of *pressure*,” Uphir said menacingly. 

“W-Wait! C-Can’t you knock me out or give me something for the pain?!” I begged.

Uphir paused for a moment before he burst out laughing hysterically, “Oh! That was a good one, dear Charity! Did you forget where you are?” 

Tears filled my eyes as I whimpered.

“This isn’t some chummy hospital where you’re going to get a cup of jello and some happy pills following your procedure,” Uphir laughed, “You’re in Hell, sweetheart!”

“W-What if I bite off my tongue!” I tried to protest as I heard the sound of sharp instruments sliding over flesh behind me.  

“What if you… Oh…” Uphir’s voice caught a hint of intrigue, “Oh… Please do.”

“W-What?!” I screamed before I felt a knife digging into the open end of my spine.  I pulled hard against the restraints as Uphir was literally pulling at my spinal cord, sending shockwaves of pain over every inch of my body.   

I screamed and wailed as I felt pins and needles shoved into the base of my flesh! Just as I said, while I writhed and suffered on the operating room table, an intense and precise pain radiated up and down my entire spine, causing me to thrash and, of course, bite down hard on my tongue.

I spat it out, fearing I’d swallow it, and sputtered as my mouth filled with blood.

I felt something behind me and groaned as what felt like a leg slapped the ground, then the wall.

“Oh! Success!” Uphir called out before strapping down the thing behind me.

I was writhing now on the table all the more, feeling like I had some purchase against the ground with my limb. Had my legs grown back somehow?  

Finally, to my complete shock, the pain was starting to ebb slowly. Now just a dull ache in my midsection. I began to relax slightly, the coppery taste of blood still fresh in my mouth. There was a sea of blood coating the wall in front of me.

“Pale as a sheet,” Uphir said, “Tsk, Tsk, Tsk,” he knelt and picked my tongue up off the ground.

I was feeling dizzy at this point, but still, I couldn’t pass out. I was stuck feeling the relatively slight pain of my severed tongue.  

“I suppose you’d like it if I were to reattach this, yes?” Uphir taunted me.

I nodded weakly.

Uphir tossed my tongue behind me and removed the strap on my head, “No, I've got a better replacement for you, my dear," He produced a large and horrific-looking forked tongue.

I tried to scream again as Uphir’s tight grip on my jaw nearly broke it off. His fingers reached into my mouth and gripped the stub of my tongue, “Of course, you didn’t do as good a job as I’d like, so out comes the whole thing!” 

My mouth filled with blood again and dizziness took me, the room spinning as the pain filled my mind, as Uphir ripped what remained of my tongue from my mouth.

Uphir obscured my vision as his hands stuffed the alien-looking tongue into my mouth, stitching it into place with a rough-looking chord and a rusty needle.

The taste of blood grew tenfold as I felt the tongue come alive in my mouth!  

Uphir’s fingers finally left my mouth and he undid the straps on my shoulders and arms.

I reeled back, gasping for air as the pain faded away slowly, “Ah!” I gasped, “What did you do to me, you bas-sss-tard?!” I blinked in confusion, a heavy lisp in my voice now.

“Oh, splendid!” Uphir said, clapping his hands, “Let me help you up… Let us see how you react to the other improvements I've made to you."

Uphir undid the last strap holding my head down, and I turned to see the open door. I moved to rush out of it, only to see the coils of a massive snake lurch forward toward the door.

I fell backward, crashing to the ground and taking the bloodied operating table with me. “S-sss-nake!” I screamed, pointing to the writhing coils.

Uphir laughed maniacally, “Oh, how utterly delightful!” 

I pushed the table off myself and glanced down at my body in horror. 

The coils of the snake writhing before me weren’t that of some other demon.

They were attached to me! I screamed in shock as I watched the coils twist and turn in their panic, unsure what to do with my failed attempts at moving them. My midsection had a clear line of rough sewing thread attaching the tail to my body.  For the first time since that horrible creature swallowed up my legs, I couldn’t feel my original legs anymore!

“Why?!” I cried out, sobbing and hissing as I did so.

Uphir’s laugh grew cruel and taunting as he loomed over me, “Because you’re my newest little assistant, Charity. You’ll be here forever, helping me mend rendered flesh and conjure little Chimera like yourself,” His smile grew even more prominent as his teeth almost glowed, his eyes illuminating with madness as the light seemed sucked out of the room. “Don’t worry, dear Charity… I’ll hold your place for when you return."

Black.

Everything finally faded to black.

I woke up with something in my mouth and I was in a panic before someone quickly grabbed my wrist.

“Charity, it’s okay! We had to intubate you. Calm down!” I heard a strangely familiar voice call out as I turned to see a thin nurse with a gold headband and dark skin.  “It’s okay.” 

I couldn’t speak, the tube down my throat making it impossible. I could have sworn I had heard the nurse's voice before. I glanced at her name tag: “Sisaye, B.” 

I blinked, looking at her golden eyes, a tear rolling down my cheek.

“You pulled through, honey,” Sisaye, who I was positive was actually Sisoe in human form, said to me, “You rest now. You’ve been through a terrible ordeal.”

With that I finally relaxed. Eventually, I got my tube removed, painfully, but not nearly as much pain as I had experienced.

My voice was hoarse and somehow, I still had a lisp. 

Eventually, a doctor came to my bedside, “Hello, Charity,” he said, looking me over, “You’re lucky to be here. My name is Dr. Faust. I am your surgeon.”

I looked Dr. Faust over, checking for wings or anything, “U-Uphir?”

“Yes, you’re up here,” Dr. Faust said as he looked over my vitals, “Your accident did a number on you. The seat belt trapped your legs and you suffered severe burns. Skin grafts are a long-term solution, but as of now, we have them dressed and sanitized. You have a long way to go to recover.”

I frowned and spoke softly, “W-what about Dr. sss-Singh?” I gasped, clasping my hands to my mouth.

“Who is Dr. Singh?” Dr. Faust asked.

I paused, considering everything I had gone through, “I… I think Dr.sss-Singh wa-sss-s in the other car. I lo-sss-st control, I think.”

“Well, you can tell the police that. We have to focus on your recovery,” Dr. Faust explained.

“W-Why am I… Lis-sss-ping?” I wondered if it was all a dream at this point, but the similarities were growing more apparent.

“I’m afraid your tongue severed in the crash. We had to reattach it, so some numbness, slurring, and lisping may be the case for the short-term,” Dr. Faust explained as he checked my vitals.

“Mom!” I heard Jeremy cry out as he rushed to me.

I hugged him tightly, “Jeremy!”

Jeremy cried softly into my arms as his father walked in behind him, smiling at me and pushing Gracie, our toddler, around in her stroller, “Hey, hun. How are you doing?”

Even my oldest daughter, Joy, came running, her purple-dyed hair bobbing up and down as she hugged me tight, “Mom! Holy shit, thank God you’re okay.”

I hugged them both, sighing in relief, “My Babie-sss-s,” I blushed as I hissed again.

“Mom? You okay?” Jeremy asked.

I just nodded.

“She’s been through a lot,” Dr. Faust explained, “We’ll keep her here for some time, as we aren’t out of the woods yet and need to make sure she’s not suffering any infections. But I’ll leave you folks alone for a bit,” he smiled as he walked out of the room.

Despite everyone telling me everything was okay, my eyes kept moving to Jeremy. I wondered more and more if all that had happened to me was real.

My husband, Ronald, said something amidst all the chatter that caught my attention, “Don’t worry, hun. I’ll make sure that bastard pays for what he did to you.”

I frowned, “Dr. S-sss-ignh?” I asked.

Ron nodded, “Yes, we’re pressing full charges.”

“Don’t,” I snapped.

Ron blinked, “Hun… You know what he does for a living, right? You’ve protested outside his practice. I know he did this intentionally.”

“He losss-st hi-sss-s little girl,” I said softly, “He wa-sss-s… It wa-sss-s probably an acc-sss-ident.”

“I can’t forgive him for what he did to you! What if you’re stuck with that speech impediment for good?” Ron asked.

“If I can forgive him, s-sss-o can you,” I admonished, “You have to,” I said to Joy and Jeremy, “All of you.”

Ron sighed, “You’re too good for this world, Charity,” he smiled at me and kissed me on the forehead, “I’m just glad God didn’t call you up just yet.”

I frowned, looking to my lap, “Y-yeah. Not yet.”

An announcement came out over the PA system: “Visiting Hours are over in ten minutes.”

Ron sighed, “Come on, kids, time to give mom some time to rest up.”

Joy nodded, giving me a peck on the cheek before she joined up with her father.

Jeremy got to his feet behind them, but I had to say something.

“Jeremy,” I whispered, “Can you hang back for a S-sss-econd for me?” I asked.

Ron turned to me, “What’s wrong, hun?”

“I jus-sss-t want to talk to him alone,” I explained, “Mom s-sss-tuff.”

Ron just smiled and headed out with Gracie and Joy.

Jeremy  sighed, “I didn’t tell-”

I hugged him, “...I died.”

Jeremy was silent.

“...Angel-sss s-sss-howed me what happened,” I pulled him away from me, looking him in the eye, “It’s-sss not your fault. I put you up to it. They forced you. You s-sss-hould s-sss-ay s-sss-omething.”

Jeremy  frowned, “No one will believe me.”

“I will,” I explained, “And s-sss-ome boy on that team is-sss going to have to have a s-sss-udden bout of morality and he’ll back you up.”

“But I… I was the one who,” Jeremy trailed off.

I just nodded, hugging him, “And I’ll come clean too. Okay? I put you up to thi-sss-s. You s-sss-houldn’t have to deal with it.”

Jeremy nodded, “Okay, mom.  Thanks,” he smiled and left the room.

The lights shut off and I leaned back, “Okay, S-sss-is-sss-ynios,” I whispered, “I’ll change, dra-sss-stically. Uriel’sss going to have a whole new book to read.”

That’s when I heard a familiar and dark laugh from the TV in the room. I glanced up, seeing nothing but static on the screen, followed by a strange digitized mouth and eyes.  “Oh, you *think* so, don’t you? You little snake… But they won’t be the only ones watching!"

I shivered in my bed as the TV flickered.

“After all,” Uphir’s devious voice echoed, [“I need my little… *As-sss-sistant!”*](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Guardian_Temple)

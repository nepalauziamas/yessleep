This is a story, I never imagined I'd have to share again. A story, so absurd even the most imaginative mind can not fathom to conjure.

A 4 ft tall brown Teddy bear, stood hunched over in front of my doorstep. It was balanced against the pillar of the house "Huh, I do not remember odering this. Emmy, I think your dad sent you this!" , I called out to my daughter. I had to lift it up with both hands. The thing was heavy, "What kinda stuffing do they use nowadays", I dragged it all the way to the living room and let it drop with a loud grunt. Emmy, my daughter at the time was only 6. With too much energy. She sprung on me from behind me. Screaming in delight "I love it I love it I loveeee it!" Throwing her hands in the air. "I don't know how you're gonna manage to take that thing around with you anywhere because its a bit heavy. Even for me", but my words fell on deaf ears as she jumped on the teddy bear and snuggled it. "You're my bwest friend" 

I spent most of my working time on my laptop. Usually Emily will be at he foot of my chair, humming to the rhythm of my keyboard. But now with another family member she was always cooped up in her room.I still couldn't figure out how she managed to carry that thing around, but she did. I'd find it in strange places, she no longer needed me to wake her up for school the doll someone had that part sorted. One night, I woke up in the middle of the night. To hear voices, one of them was undoubtedly Emmy's but the other was cartoonish. I slowly, and carefully walked over to her room where I head chuckling and chattering. I pushed open the door and turned on the lights, Emmy's eyes shoot up "What are you doing up sweety?" I asked her, pushing the teddy bear to the side. "Mr Beezingers was telling me a story mommy", she let out a smile. "Mr Who?" I turned my head over to the teddy bear, it was resting next to her. "Mr Beezingers, thats his name", I kissed her forehead "Okay okay baby. Now get some sleep okay. Mr Beezingers will tell you a story tomorrow okay. Won't you Mr Beezingers?", the doll's head dropped, "That's odd, probably the position it was resting on" I thought, I tucked her in and said our goodnights then headed over to my bed.

Emmy, was a shy kid. Hardly had any friends at school and I suspected she got bullied but she'd shut me down whenever I brought it up. I pushed that to the side . My deadline was at nigh so I focused more at work. I didn't realize the signs, I'm ashamed to say it. But I was happy I didn't have to look after her because she now had company. At first Emmy started insisting, I dish up an extra plate for Mr Beezingers. And almost every time when I'd go collect them from her room, the plates will be completely empty and licked clean. I was happy she was eating. For her age, my daughter was too small and had a hard time eating, therefore I appreciated the appetite.

Food started missing, even some of my bras and panties. I assumed Emmy was taking them to play dress up. So I shrugged it off. "Hey baby, did you take the crackers I left on top of the cabinet?" She shook her head "No mommy, I didn't" I asked her again but she was adament she didn't. Later on I had her scolding Mr Beezingers "No, mommy doesn't like it when her favorite snack disappear", then the cartoonish voice responded. I couldn't hear it clearly. At that point I was sure I was overthinking from working too much. I ran myself a hot steamy bath. Fixed a glass of wine. I got in the tub and sighed, my eyes caught something at the door. I was sure I had closed it, but now it was slightly ajar. And Mr Beezingers' head poking from the other room. His beady eyes watching me. It was creepy, but I was lazy to move. The hot water fel good on my skin. When I was done, I found no sign of him on the doorway. Which was odd. I didn't hear any footsteps or whatsoever.

Emmy started taking him with her for baths. This part was unsettling but it was just a doll. Late afternoon I had a call from her school, it was about my daughter. "Ms Madison, does your daughter watch any TV shows with vulgar language in 'em?" The principal fixed his glassed with his thumb. I shook my head, "What is this about?". He raised his eyebrow "Your daughter kicked her classmate in the privates and used the words & I quote 'Next time. I'll rip them off you sniveling cunt'. Is that what you teach kids in your household ma'am?". I was shocked at this revelation and accusation "Believe me, I'm stunned as you are. That not her. Thats not my daughter". "And when asked about where she got that from. She said Mr Bezingers taught her", I raised my finger to object "Uhmm actually its Beezingers. Like Bee and zingers", he hit his desk with his palm "Do you think this is a joke? Your daughter tied a rock on her shoe and kicked a boy! Then spat on his face".

The ride home was quiet, "What happened honey?", her lips were quivering. "Toby, Toby was spitting on my lunch. Sometimes making me eat a booger sandwich. He'd warn me not to tell anyone because his dad has a gun". I apologized for not noticing sooner. That night I baked her a cake and we took a bath together. "Can Mr Beezingers join?? Pwease.", I agreed, we placed him on the corner while we took a bath. That night she slept with me, when I woke up around midnight Mr Beezingers was on the other side of the bed. His beady eyes staring straight into my soul. "How did you get here", I groggily stood up, and I
sneezed "Bless you", a cartoonosh voice spoke up, coming from Mr Beezingers, "What did you just say?", my eyes were wide, I looked at the doll. Nearly jumped out of my skin when something touched my hand, "Mommy. Are you okay?". It was Emmy, she had woken up. "Yea yea sweety".

During breakfast, I watched her eat, and take Mr Beezingers' food to the room, a single thought plagued my mind. Mr Beezingers really can talk. I tip toed to her room, and peeped through the keyhole. I saw the doll move. And I pushed open the door "Aha!". Emmy looked at me like I was mad "uhuh?". "I thought, I thought. Nothing continue" I closed the room and left. Maybe I was losing my mind, Mr Beezingers now started giving off an ominous vibes. It was the little things at first, slight movements. Something to keep me on edge. I'd see him move from my peripheral. I needed to feed this furnace that was curiosity burning within me. I went into Emmy's room while she slept, knife in hand. I don't know what I was planning. Mr Beezingers laid next to her, with his hand wrapped neatly around her waist. I drew the knife, and pointed it to his head. Slowly moving it closer, Emmy woke up "Mom,mommy whats going on?", She startled me, I couldn't come up with a lie. "I was sleep walking, go back to sleep honey" I left her room, closing the door behind me. Mr Beezingers' head emerged from the other side. I couldn't see, but I could tell he was smiling. Something supernatural was at play.

Thats it. That was the proof I needed. I had to catch him in the act. He was haunted, the doll was alive. And started emmiting a foul stench. I cussed myself for being stupid but I cussed at Mark for even buying that Chucky wannabe. After yelling and cussing at Emmy's dad on the phone he told me something that shoot me to the core, and squeezed my insides. "I don't know what you're talking about. I didn't buy no damn doll!", he hung up. "But if he didnt then who did", That night I burned sage, and made a circle of salt around my bad. I locked Emmy's door and locked Mr Beezingers in there. I was sure it was gonna work. Until, I woke up to the words "Mommy, mommy. Mr Beezingers says come under the bed" . I jumped off the bed, with Emmy in my arms. Dashing towards the door, something grabbed my ankle and I fell head first to the ground. Emmy landing on the side. My head rang, Mr Beezingers emerged from under the bed, talking in a cartoonish voice. He took short strides towards me "Mommy want to play. Mommy play" he jumped on top of me squeezing its fluffy paws on my neck. Emmy jumped at him, kicking and screaming. He tossed her to the side. She let out a whimper as she landed against the wall. I shoved him off me and he landed with a loud thump. I pulled out the knife under the pillow and stabbed him. Bleeding stuffings, with every stab until he stopped moving. I rushed over to check on Emmy.

Something struck me at the back of the head and I fell to the floor convulsing. Blood dribbling off the side, I saw a naked scrawny man with  strands of hair on his head "Mommy wanna play. Mommy play" in a cartoonish voice. He was walking towards me on his toes,  laughing. I blacked out.

When I came to. I was surrounded by the police and my daughter. "What, what happened?", she hugged me when she saw that I was okay. But hurt badly. The detective who spoke to me was blunt  "So, Mr Beezingers. Was actually Edwin Wranger. 50 year old male who happened to be wanted for over 15 child related murders and other homicide cases. What we found inside the teddy bear. Was a few stuffings and some semen. Thats what we used to identify him" he turned over to my daughter "You did good by calling". "Wait? There was cum stains in the doll. What. That thing. Did you get him?" I asked, hopping for a semblance of good news. My hopes came crumbling "I'm afraid no". They left. And we decided to head to a hotel for the night. I couldn't recall much from the night. So Emmy filled in the blanks. She was shaking "Mr Beezingers left you alone because he wanted me. I told him he can take me. He said he'll come back once I'm 18. I'm sorry mommy".

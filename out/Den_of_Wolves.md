There was a fire. Smoke billowed above the tree tops—the aroma of beef cooking on an open flame. There was music—some kind of pop country. And there was singing and laughing—voices young and jubilant.

“Sounds like girls,” Mike said. 

“I hear some guys, too,” I said.

“Sounds like more girls than guys, though.”

“Think we should go check it out?”

Mike looked at the can of beans he’d half-finished and set it on a nearby rock. “Girls and barbecue sound a hell of a lot better than what we’re doing.”

I stood and grabbed my bag and slung it onto my back, and zipped the tent shut. “Agreed.”

Mike also put on his bag, and we set off toward the commotion. As we got closer, we could see the fire, high and wide, licking toward the night sky. Dancing around it were a group of men and women, none of who looked older than thirty. We knelt amongst the trees and watched, and Mike whispered, “My God, those women are gorgeous.”

“What are they doing out here?”

“Who cares? Let’s go talk to them.”

“We’re miles deep in the wilderness, Mike. They see us strutting toward them, they’ll think we’re serial killers.”

Mike stood and said, “That’s a chance I’m willing to take,” and stepped out of the woods and toward the party. I sighed and followed him.

One of the men in the group, standing away from the fire, drinking a beer and eating barbecue from a plate, noticed us and shouted to the others, “Hey, someone’s coming,” and when those preoccupied with dancing didn’t hear him, he shut off the music. “People are coming,” he warned again.

Everyone turned to look at him and traced his finger to Mike and me walking toward them. “We come in peace,” Mike announced with a big, friendly smile.

“Stop right there!” Another young man, who’d been busy dancing with an attractive auburn-haired woman, demanded and pulled a hatchet from his belt.

“Hold on now,” Mike said. “We don’t mean y’all any harm. We’re just camped over in those woods there and heard what sounded like a good time and figured we’d come check it out.”

“We don’t mean to frighten you. If you want us to leave, we will,” I added.

The group stared at us, seven of them in total—three men and four women. Then the auburn-haired woman whispered something in the man with the hatchet’s ear, and he nodded and said, “Alright, y’all can join us.”

Mike looked at me and smiled, then trotted toward them, and I followed. The group was no longer strained and suspicious but had become warm and welcoming. 

The woman with the auburn hair was the first to ask my name and I found myself completely mesmerized by how beautiful she was. Her skin was sun-kissed, silken and unblemished, with eyes like shining emeralds glittering in the firelight. Long auburn hair almost reminiscent of the flames behind her.

“I’m Name,” I mumbled.

“Your name is… *Name?*” She asked quizzically.

I shook my head and laughed, embarrassedly. “Sorry. I’m Noah.”

“Hi, Noah. I’m Sunday.”

“Really? Like the day of the week?”

Sunday smiled. “Yep,” then she touched the shoulder of the blonde man with the hatchet, “And this is Tuesday.”

Tuesday turned and smiled and held out his hand. “Nice to meet you.” I shook it and said, “Wait… are all of you named after days of the week?” Sunday lovingly wrapped her arms around Tuesday’s torso and laid her head against his muscled arm and laughed, and said, “You’ve figured us out, Noah.”

Tuesday pulled Sunday closer and kissed the top of her head, and then started pointing out the others. Monday, Friday, and Saturday were the other women, Thursday was the man who first spotted us, and Wednesday was a quiet, bearded man sitting off to the side, drinking a beer and eating.

“These are nicknames, though, right?” I asked.

“No. They’re our birth names.”

I looked around at the others and then back at Tuesday and said, “Huh?” And right then, I felt a hand on my shoulder, and Mike said, “Hey, mind if I steal him for a minute?”

Tuesday shrugged. “Sure.”

Mike pulled me away from the group and said, “Dude, they’re all named after the days of the week.”

“Yeah, I know. They’ve got to be fucking with us, right?”

Mike shook his head. “They’re siblings.”

I glanced over at Sunday and Tuesday, still locked in an embrace and gazing at the fire. “Are you sure?”

“Yeah, dude. You know what that means.”

“What?”

“Tonight may be the night that we finally hook up with sisters. Who do you want? That Sunday chick seems to like you. Why don’t you take the whole weekend, and I’ll do Friday and Monday?”

“I don’t think Tuesday would be too happy with that,” I said and discreetly nodded in their direction in time for Mike to see Sunday and Tuesday kissing. Mike grimaced and said, “Yeesh.”

“Yeah.”

“Alright. So they’re a little free-spirited. Whatever. What happens in the wilds stays in the wilds. Not like we plan on staying in contact with them anyway, right?”

I shrugged. 

Mike reached over and grabbed me by both shoulders and shook me. “I’m camping with you for two weeks, Noah. Just you and me. That’s a long time for two straight dudes to spend together in the woods. Let me have this one night. Please.”

I rolled my eyes and smiled. “Yeah, yeah. Go on, you horny bastard.”

“Thank you! Now, please, do yourself a favor and go fuck that beautiful redhead before her brother does.”

“I think I will have to pass on that one.”

“Suit yourself,” Mike said, then jogged back to the women.

When I rejoined the group, Sunday was alone. I set my bag down and asked, “Where’s Tuesday?”

She nodded at a large enclosed canopy tent and said, “He’s fixing a plate for you and your friend.”

“Oh, cool.”

Sunday smiled and handed me her beer. “Thirsty?”

“You’re not drinking it?”

“I can share.”

I took a sip and then handed it back. “Thanks.” She smiled and took a sip of her own and began swaying to the music that had started playing again. “Hey,” I said. Sunday raised her eyebrows while she continued dancing. “Are you all siblings?”

Sunday smiled and said, “Yes. Why?”

“I just, you know… the names. You said they were your birth names.”

“Our mother gave birth every year or two until she had the seven of us. I was the first, then Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and so on.”

“Wow. Your parents were busy.”

Sunday laughed. “We don’t all have the same father.”

“Oh, okay. It almost sounds like your mom planned to have seven children. What would she have done if there was an eighth?”

Sunday’s smile suddenly disappeared, and she stopped dancing, chugged the remainder of the beer, and then tossed it into the fire. “Excuse me for a minute.”

“Did I say something wrong?” 

Sunday kept walking and disappeared into the canopy tent where Tuesday was preparing our meals. I sighed and turned to see Mike enthusiastically dancing with the other three sisters, then I walked over to a cooler and grabbed a beer and meandered over to the quiet, seemingly anti-social brother, Wednesday, who continued to sit in a chair, drinking and staring off into the fire. “Mind if I join you?” I asked. He glanced up at me, then looked back at the fire.

I sat in a chair beside him and held out my hand. “I’m Noah.”

Without accepting my handshake, he responded, “Wednesday.”

I hesitated, then returned my hand to my lap and said, “Nice to meet you,” and took a sip from my beer. For several moments, we both stared at the fire in silence until I asked, “So, what brought you guys out here?”

“Tradition.”

“Oh yeah?”

“We come out here once a year, just like we used to do with our mother.”

“That’s fun. Where’s your mom now?”

Wednesday didn’t answer.

I waited and, after receiving no response, sipped at my beer and said, “Y’all live nearby?”

Wednesday finished his beer, crushed the can, and opened a bottle he took from the cooler. “Sometimes.”

“Sometimes?”

“We move a lot.”

“Together?”

Wednesday sighed and stood and said, “I’m going to bed,” then headed off toward the tents, leaving his opened but full beer behind.

“Don’t mind him,” Sunday said as she walked up and sat in his chair and handed me a plateful of barbecued meat. “He’s just a grump.”

I took the plate from her and said, “Thanks. What is it?”

“Try it. See if you can guess.”

It was soft and boneless. Tender and juicy. Charred a bit on the exterior, but that only added to the flavor, which was enhanced further with a sweet and savory sauce. I chewed it a bit and asked, “Is it veal?”

Sunday smiled. “Well, ain’t you smart.”

“Is this what we’ve been smelling?”

“Sure is. How do you like it?”

I took another bite. “It’s good. Different. Veal is calf, right?”

Sunday nodded. “Butchered them ourselves.”

I frowned. “That couldn’t have been easy.”

“What do you mean?”

“Slaughtering baby cows.”

Sunday looked at me and stood, then grabbed my plate from me and sat on my lap. “Are you an animal lover, Noah?”

I smiled. “Comes with the name, I suppose.”

Sunday held the veal and fed me another bite, then patted my mouth with a napkin and said, “I find that often one’s name determines who they become. You ever notice that?”

“People’s names usually seem to fit them.”

“Like, Karen?”

I laughed. “Exactly.”

Sunday giggled and looked at me, then said, “What about me?”

I stared into her emerald eyes, my arms around her waist, and said, “I’ve never met a Sunday I didn’t like.”

“Oh,” Sunday grinned and leaned close, eyeing my mouth while tenderly caressing my chin. “Know a lot of Sundays, do you?”

“Just one.”

Sunday leaned forward and kissed me, then stood up and took my hand, and began leading me toward the tents. Along the way, Mike and I locked eyes, the other three sisters around him feeding him veal as if he were some Ancient Emperor. He stood up, straightened his posture, playfully saluted me, then sat back down and continued eating.

Inside the tent was a comfortable combination of blankets and pillows made from various materials, including bear furs. Sunday sealed the tent and handed me the unlabeled beer Wednesday had opened but never drank. “Figured you might want this,” she said.

“Did you slip a roofie in it?” I half-joked.

“Absolutely.”

I laughed, then said, “Wait, really?”

Sunday rolled her eyes and took the bottle from me and took a long swing. “Happy?”

I grabbed the bottle and took a swig of my own, grimaced, and said, “That’s not beer.”

“Family recipe.”

“It’s red.”

“There’s berries in it.”

“Well, there’s enough alcohol content to assure you don’t taste them.”

Sunday took another swig and then passed it to me. We went back and forth until the bottle was empty, then she tossed it aside, took off her shirt, and laid on top of me, pressing her lips to mine. Then, I took off my clothes and the rest of hers. It was a dance of flesh and colors and sounds and movement. Pleasure without thought of consequence. Animalistic. And, in the steaming darkness of the tent, came a strand of flickering light and a thin wisp of smoke, and I could see, hunched in the corner of the tent, Tuesday, having slipped in unnoticed. Consumed by a world unsteady, unfocused, and spinning, and passion of quality wild and raw, Tuesday’s presence felt insignificant. Unobtrusive. All that mattered to me at that moment was Sunday. She was everything.

______________________________

I awoke the following morning, naked and alone in Sunday’s tent. The air filled with the familiar smell from the night before. Smoke and veal. I slid into my clothes and stepped out of the tent, and squinted into the new light.

“Noah!” Someone hollered, and I turned to see Sunday waving me over. I joined her and the others, who were sitting by the smothered fire, eating veal. “How’d you sleep?”

“Good,” I said, “Where’s Mike?”

Sunday looked around and shrugged. “Around here somewhere. You hungry?”

I looked at Sunday’s half-finished plate and shook my head. “No thanks. I need to find Mike.”

I walked over to the three sisters I’d seen Mike with the previous night and asked, “Have you seen Mike?”

They looked up from their plates and shrugged. “I think he left,” said Friday.

I looked toward the woods and said, “Oh,” then walked over to Sunday and asked, “Have you seen my bag?”

“You’re not leaving, are you?”

“I need to go check on Mike.”

“Why? He’s a big boy.”

“Just tell me where my bag is.”

A hand grabbed my shoulder from behind, and I turned to see Tuesday. “Noah, buddy. What’s the matter?”

“I’m looking for my bag.”

“It’s over there.” Tuesday pointed at my bag sitting outside the canopy tent he’d been preparing the food in the previous night.

“Thanks,” I said and walked over and picked the bag up, then stopped as I heard a loud thump of a blade chopping down against a cutting board. I hoisted the bag over my shoulder and crept over to the entrance of the tent and began to lift the flap.

“You don’t want to do that,” Tuesday said, startling me from behind. He stepped over and blocked the entrance. 

“Why?”

“Sunday tells me you’re somewhat fond of animals. I’d hate for you to see my brother butchering calves.”

“Are they already dead?”

“Yeah, they’re dead. But, still… it ain’t a pretty sight.”

I swallowed and stepped away from the tent. “I need to go.”

Tuesday shrugged and held out his hand. “Sure. Thanks for coming by.” I shook his hand and headed on, and he hollered behind me, “Come by later if you want. I’m sure Sunday would like that.”

Sunday stopped me at the woods. “Noah, wait.”

“Yeah?”

“What’s wrong?”

“I just need to make sure Mike is okay.”

“Why you so worried?”

“I convinced him to come on this trip with me. The last thing I want to do is abandon him.”

“You didn’t have fun last night?”

“I had fun. I’m happy I met you. But, I’ve got to check on Mike.”

“You’ll be coming back, right?”

I looked off into the woods, then back at Sunday and sighed, “Yeah, probably.”

Sunday smiled and wrapped her arms around me, then kissed me softly and said, “Please, come back.”

“Okay.”

“Yeah?”

“Yeah, let me go find Mike first.”

Sunday smiled and let go of me, and I smiled back and headed into the woods.


_________________________________

Our campsite was empty. Tents and supplies—all gone.

“Mike!” I hollered and listened as the only response was my echo bouncing off the nearby mountains. “Fuck,” I muttered. I looked around for any nearby clues and found nothing. 

When I returned to the group, Sunday greeted me with a big smile and rushed over. “Back so soon?”

“Where is he?”

Sunday stopped and frowned. “Who?”

“Don’t play stupid. Where the fuck is Mike?”

“I told you, I don’t know.”

“Whoa, hold on now,” Tuesday said as he walked over and pressed a hand to my chest. “What’s going on?”

I shoved him and he stumbled back a few feet then stopped and stared at me, his jaw tense and hand near the hatchet hanging from his hip. “Careful,” he warned. Wednesday and Thursday had come out of the canopy tent and walked toward us. The women stood to the side, watching.

“All of our stuff is gone,” I said.

“What do you mean?”

“Our campsite. It’s empty. Everything is gone, including Mike.”

Tuesday relaxed. “Oh, man. I’m sorry to hear that, Noah. Any idea where he might’ve gone?”

I laughed. “You fucking piece of shit. Mike didn’t run off with all that stuff. Y’all did this.”

“Noah,” Sunday said, “You’ve got to believe us. We haven’t seen him or your stuff.”

I stared at her and looked around at the others, then said, “Let me look in that tent over there.”

“Noah, you don’t want to see what’s in that tent. It’s baby cows. Dead ones.”

“I don’t give a fuck. Let me look inside.”

Tuesday and Sunday exchanged looks, and she nodded, and Tuesday said, “Alright, fine. Come on.”

Tuesday walked with me to the tent, and the others sauntered behind, and when we got there, Tuesday stepped aside and said, “Well, go ahead.” I stepped over and pulled the flaps apart and looked in, and immediately became sick.

Mike’s naked corpse lay limbless on a large blood-soaked wooden table. His eyes gouged out. A metal cleaver stabbed into the wood next to him. Containers of cut meat sat on one side of the tent and a pile of human bones on the other. 

I stumbled back out of the tent and vomited.

“I tried to tell you,” Tuesday said. 

I quickly reached into my pocket for my knife, but someone grabbed my backpack and yanked me backward, pulling me to the ground. Then, I tried to roll but was immediately hit with a kick to the side. Tuesday knelt and pinned me with one hand and fished my knife from my pocket with the other, then stood and handed it to Thursday. 

“I wish it didn’t have to come to this, Noah,” Tuesday said. “Sunday really seemed to take a liking to you.”

Sunday stood over me and said, “I’m sorry about Mike. I really am. But he brought it on himself. He chose to walk out of those woods last night. Like a sheep wandering into a den of wolves.”

“Fuck you. I came out of those woods, too.”

“Yes, but you’re different, Noah. You’re a wolf like us. My brothers don’t think so, but I see it. I can feel it inside of me.”

“What?”

“You gave me your seed last night, Noah. And it will grow into a child. Our child.”

“You can’t possibly know that after one night.”

Sunday knelt and smiled, then kissed me and said, “I do know.” Then she stood and nodded at Tuesday, and the last thing I saw was the bottom of his boot.

And then everything went dark.

They say if you’re knocked unconscious for longer than a few minutes, you’re probably fixing to die. So when I woke up beneath the night sky, I didn’t know what to think. But, I soon noticed a little mark on my arm where they’d injected me with something to put me out longer. 

I sat up and looked around and recognized the spot as the one the family had been camping on. Now empty. All that remained was my backpack, and attached to it was a letter, which read:

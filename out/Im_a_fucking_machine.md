Short skirt. Thigh high suspenders. Killer heels. Long, thick black hair. She had pulled out all the stops. The type of girl that made even a stone cold bastard like me consider revising my one-night policy. 

The fucking was formulaic. Work them up, get them moaning, erupt, get them out, rinse and repeat. I recognise that most people think men like me are disgusting. But I bet more are jealous of my consistent success than they would care to admit. 

I wish I felt as disgusted by my behaviour as others did. I wish I felt at all. Had I become so detached that the only thing that made me feel alive was my dick? It certainly consumed my thoughts. Was my lack of concern a reason to worry? 

I tried to work out where it all went wrong. To ponder which event in my life had turned me into this soulless fuck machine, but I kept coming up blank. Instead was nothing but a dreamy montage of gorgeous one night stands. 

I didn’t know why I was like this. Why I was in the same spot in the same bar the very next night? Why hadn’t the girl in the suspenders been enough? I struggled to fathom my insatiable desire and pondered a cause, getting nowhere. Maybe the answer was in the blonde girl’s panties. 

She was cute. More enthusiastic than most and I liked that. She beamed in the taxi ride home and danced into my apartment. She was so full of vibrant personality that I wished I had. 

Peeling off her clothes felt good. She kept intense eye contact throughout. She was so damn hot I felt about ready to explode. 

Afterwards she wanted to cuddle. So many of them do. 

She nuzzled her head into my arm and ran the fingers of her other hand along my bare chest. It was sensual. I almost felt ready for a second round. But my code of conduct was strict. It couldn’t be rewritten.

She had served her purpose, terrible as it sounded I was onto my next incredibly important mission. Get rid of her. It was always a compulsion that struck quickly post coitus. 

“It’s time to go baby, I’ll call you a cab.” 

I got up. Picked up my boxers off the floor and started to dress. The routine was infallible. 

Until it wasn’t. 

Her eyes glazed, she pulled the duvet up to her chin and looked downwards. She started to cry. 

It was a scenario I hadn’t expected. I was used to being called an arsehole... amongst other, less pleasant names. But not tears. Most of them didn’t want to show weakness like that. Heck, most of them wanted the same *fucking* thing that I did. 

She didn’t though. She wanted more. I don’t know how she expected to find what she was looking for sitting alone in five bars but I knew that I had seriously misjudged her intentions. 

Blondie was different. I wish I had gotten her name but that had never been a piece of information that I chose to retain. I asked, of course, but never absorbed. 

“Don’t you like me?” She sobbed, mascara running down her pretty face.

“Of course I do. But you know what this is, right?” 

I didn’t look her in the eyes. I should’ve known better; someone as *smooth* as I liked to think I was should’ve been able to charm himself out of the situation. I just couldn’t find the words. It was something that happened to me so many times before. I found that after I’d picked girls up I just didn’t know what to do with them. 

That sounds bad. They’re humans. Real people. It’s a reflection on me more than anything. On the lack of depth that lead to my next actions. 

I left her alone in that room to dress herself. Not a single other word. Humiliated. Crying. I should’ve known what all those behaviours meant. But I was emotionally devoid.

I walked to the kitchen and set out two glasses of water. One for her when she emerged, to wash down the alcohol before she embarked on the cab ride of shame. I thought I was doing a damn good thing. Considerate. 

“You’re a piece of shit.” 

The voice came from behind me. I turned to face her. Her eyes were wide and glazed with tears. Her expression manic. 

She took me by surprise when she plunged the knife into my chest. I felt the blade pierce my skin but I didn’t feel the pain that I expected would come with it. Where did she get the knife? It wasn’t one of mine. Who brings a knife to a bar?

I tried to process but nothing would compute. It didn’t make sense. Had I been hunted? Was the type of girl that I hunted for hunting for a guy like me herself? 

Blondie’s attack came as a nasty surprise. 

Not nearly as much surprise, however, as I felt when literal sparks started to fly. Still not a glimmer of pain. Why didn’t it hurt? Were they... wires? 

She looked surprised too. I don’t think they were the type of sparks that blondie had been anticipating from a romantic evening. Her eyes went from frenzied to frightened in seconds. There was a flurry of sound and movement. 

Men entered. They wore white hazmat suits and masks. I don’t know how the fuck they got in my flat or how they appeared so quickly with no noise. The only thing that made sense was if they’d been inside the whole time and that’s a thought that continues to fuck with me. 

One grabbed blondie and dragged her away and the other stuck a needle in my neck. Everything went black. My muscles seized up and I hit the ground. I suspect the intention was to render me unconscious but I was merely paralysed. 

*I thought you said it could weed out the crazy ones? We don’t want that in the gene pool! Now she has to be disposed of. You put this whole operation at risk you idiot!* 

I couldn’t open my eyes to see who the voice was coming from, or move my mouth to ask questions. I was incapable of making a sound. I just knew that the first voice came from whoever had injected me. 

And a different voice answered. 

*Don’t speak to me like that. Without me you wouldn’t even have an operation. We couldn’t have predicted this. It needs an update. Wipe it, reset it, we’ll have it back out in the field by tomorrow.*

I could feel the dragging. But I still couldn’t move. Still couldn’t feel any pain. In fact, when I put some thought into it, I wasn’t sure I’d ever felt actual pain. 

Why were there wires inside of me? 

I felt every prod, poke, incision. Wherever they took me I stayed for a while. It may have been hours or even days. The concept of time was immeasurable in my prison of a body. 

I felt it all. Everything. Everything but the pain. I didn’t hear those two voices again. I don’t know at what point I went to sleep but eventually there were no more memories. No more awareness.

When I woke up in my apartment it was as if nothing had happened. It was like a surreal dream. No blood from blondie’s attack... no blondie. I wonder what happened to her. No scar in my chest. No knife. Nothing. 

Had I imagined it? Did I fail to score at the bar and drown my sorrows? I wasn’t sure it was physically possible to consume the alcohol required for a vision so strong. 

I would’ve probably dismissed the whole bizarre event had it not been for blondie’s pink lace thong that had been kicked beneath my bed. 

It laid there. A stark, vibrant reminder that what had happened was real. The wires were real. 

I pressed hard against my skin in various spaces on my body but I found nothing. I tried my best to be discreet, if blondie was real then so were the men. And if the men were real they were watching. 

It awakened something in me. An inner turmoil. A realisation that my life has been a lie. No real memories and until now, no real drive to question it. I was a puppet who wanted desperately to sever the strings. 

Regardless of my newfound consciousness, I still found myself at a bar within hours of discovering blondie’s panties, checking out the talent. 

Just as I was supposed to. 

Is free will some sort of sick cosmic joke? I tried to fight a deep primitive need but it was futile. I wasn’t even sure that I controlled my own mind. I felt a tension in the back of my head and raised my hand to it. The area was hot to the touch. *Is this what fear feels like?*

Thoughts jumbled. Words turned into flurries of nonsensical letters. I knew what I had to do. 

I scanned the whole bar. I scoured the hot redhead in the corner who I was certain I would be taking home. And then I walked to the bathroom with my beer in hand. 

It was empty, which was pretty convenient for me. I took the opportunity and entered a stall, locked the door and smashed the glass against the cubicle. I took a piece of the jagged glass and held it in front of me.

I took a few moments to decide, but I settled on my stomach. I lifted my shirt and  pressed the glass shard hard against my skin. No blood came out. My worst fears were confirmed. Instead of blood there were sparks and instead of a person there were wires.

Armed with my newfound knowledge I lowered my shirt and I left the bathroom calmly. 

I returned to my space, the perfect position to eye fuck the redhead from afar. I was going to take her home for sure. I had learned so much in such a short period of time but in reality, there was only one clear and unavoidable truth.

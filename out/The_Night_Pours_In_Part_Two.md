**** 

Her hand was small and cold in mine as I started out of the bathroom.  I was around the wall and about to head outside when she pulled me back with a hissing whisper.

“He might be out there.  You need to be careful.”

I felt a mix of frightened irritation and gratefulness for her stopping our progress.  She was right.  I just wanted this to all be over and be away from there, but we needed to take it slow and be careful.  I wasn’t sure how long I would be willing to look for her brother before leaving without him, but being quiet and paying attention were good ideas either way.  Nodding at her, I gave my eyes another few moments to adjust to the darkness.  It was only when the overhead lights gave a feeble, momentary flicker that I realized why it was so dark.  All of the power had gone off as we were coming out of the bathroom.  The lights were still on out in the parking lot, but looking to my right I could no longer make out the comforting glow of the vending machines in the visitor’s center.

But I did think I spotted some movement in there.  Just for a moment, but had someone ducked down behind a table or counter?  It was quick enough it could be my imagination, but when I looked back at the girl, I could tell she’d seen it too.

“Do you think that was your brother or the other guy?”

She gave my hand a small squeeze.  “My brother.  Let’s go get him now please.”

Swallowing, I looked around again.  No sign of anyone else, and still no other cars in the lot that I could see.  Better to get him fast and get gone before this stalker or whatever he was tracked us down.  Walking fast over to the door to the visitor’s center, I winced at the squeal it gave as we opened it and went in.  Heartbeat in my ears, I looked back out for some sign we were being pursued, but there was nothing.  For her part, the woman had let go of my hand and stepped forward, calling out for her brother as she went behind the counter and headed towards a door marked “Staff Only”.

“Are you here?  I found someone to help.  Someone nice.”

As she reached out to open the door, it opened on its own, and in the shadows beyond, a larger darkness stood looking out at us.  Even in the near black of that space, I knew something was deeply wrong.  A strange, barbed terror coiled around my heart and spread up to pierce my brain as everything went swimmy for a moment and I took several shaky steps back.  I called out to the woman breathlessly.

“G-get back!  He’s here!”

She turned and looked at me, and I couldn’t be sure, but I thought she was smiling.  “No, this is my brother.  I know he’s big, but that just means he’s got room for a big heart, right?”

Still trembling, I looked between her and the looming darkness beyond.  “Um…yeah, I guess.  I just…maybe I should just go and get help.  You can wait here.”

The woman shook her head slightly.  “No, we can’t do that.”  She turned back to the dark.  “Martin, come on out here before you scare our friend away.  And take your coat back.  It’s itchy.”  The dark figure shambled forward, gently taking the giant raincoat from his sister and shrugging it on.

“I don’t feel right about this.”  The voice was deep and masculine, but surprisingly young and refined.  It was then that I realized it sounded very much like the woman’s, just a couple of octaves lower.  I couldn’t make out any details in the murk, but I felt like he was looking at me.  “You should get out of here.”

I almost agreed before I stopped myself.  No, whatever this was, they clearly needed help.  And how would I feel if I found out later that whoever was after them had hurt them because I left them behind?  “It’s okay.  Let’s just get out of here.  I have a car and we can go get you help.”

The woman nodded at me and then looked back at her brother.  “See?  He wants to help.  He’s brave and kind.”

Her brother was already shaking his head again.  “And you are not yourself or you wouldn’t be doing this.”

Her voice was harder this time.  Colder.  “We do what we must.”  She looked back at me.  “We’re very grateful for the help.  Let’s get out of here before it’s too late.”

Nodding uneasily, I headed back to the door and looked out.  The lights were still out in the middle between the visitor center and the bathrooms, but beyond I could see the dim but welcoming light of the parking lot, and partially obscured by the women’s bathroom, the right half of my car.  It was just a hundred yards, give or take.  We could make it in a few seconds and be gone.  I jumped as I felt a small hand on my shoulder.

“It’s time.”

Sucking in a breath, I pushed open the squeaky door and started walking fast across the common space toward the parking lot.  My gaze was going everywhere and my chest was tight with fear as I tried to imagine what might jump out at us and what I should do if that happened.  Fight?  Run?  I didn’t know and I didn’t want to find out.

We were halfway to the parking lot when the lights there began to flicker and go out.  I froze, looking around before turning back to the strangers behind me.  “I don’t know why the lights keep doing that.”

The woman nodded and gave a small laugh.  “It’s because he’s here.  He’s always been here.  Martin and I not touching doesn’t keep him away, it just chases away the light.”  I saw her shadowed hand reach out and touch the large figure behind her.  Immediately the lights in the parking lot and rest stop sprang back to life.

And I began to cry out in terror.

Her brother…this man, this monster…he was twice her size and half again mine, but I barely noticed that anymore.  For I could see his bare torso beneath the open raincoat, a twisted landscape of white scars and black wounds, all just framing for the gaping hole running from the bottom of his neck all the way down to his belly.  He looked grotesquely eviscerated, and yet he still stood and walked, still looked at me with sad eyes as his sister giggled, slipping off her remaining clothes quickly as I backed away in shocked horror.  This was all impossible.  A nightmare. 

I must have murmured the last, because the woman paused.  She had been climbing her brother, climbing into the opening in his chest cavity like a joey climbing into its mother’s pouch, when she paused and looked back at me.  Naked and unashamed and terrifying for the malignant insanity filling her eyes.

“Not a nightmare.  But you aren’t too far off.”  Tucking her head, she slipped into the void as he gave a soft grunt, her face wreathed in his twisted scars as she looked out at me with a crazed grin.

“We can’t do this, Janie.”

She looked up at her brother with annoyance.  “Hush now.  Too late for all that.”

I was thirty feet away now, still slowly backpedaling.  I could try to make it to my car, but I felt sure they would run me down before I got inside.  The only other thing I could think of was to stall.  Stall and beg if they let me.

“Please don’t do this.  Let me go.”

“Can’t do that.”

“Why?  Why me?”

Her face crumpled slightly, and for a moment she seemed to be weeping.  Martin reached out a massive hand to her and she took it gently before looking back at me with a cold solemnity that was worse than her insanity had been a moment before.

“Because we can’t stay here.  We don’t belong.  We have to go home.”  Wiping her eyes, she suddenly gave me a razor-sharp shark’s grin.

I grew up on Oahu, and have a strange story that I'd like some help with.

&#x200B;

I was in my friend's car riding around aimlessly, listening to music one night. He drove, I was always the DJ. At the time, I was still a teenager- 19 years old. I had never drank, smoked anything, did drugs, or even really consumed coffee/caffeine. Got enough sleep, was fairly healthy, etc. I am only telling you this because I don't want anyone to think I made this up because I was high.

Anyway..

We were driving around. At this point it was at least midnight, if not after. It was beautiful; lush trees and foliage, old rock walls, small brick structures covered in moss. We decided to keep going up this hill we found; it was a long curvy road. It got darker and darker, and I expressed concern, to which my friend laughed and turned the music louder. I was really scared of the dark back then, but they said we were safe and there wasn't even anyone up here, so I agreed to keep driving- it was kind of exciting. I was sheltered as a kid, so it was rare that I got to have adventures like this. We finally got to the top and turned the car off. It was a clearing with shrubs and flowers, serene but eerie. You couldn't see a lot; the moon was casting only a faint light on our surroundings. It was a little chilly and foggy as well; a little too cold. My friend was now also feeling uneasy and suggested we go back.

Then we saw it. Right in front of us.

The creature was crawling up a small grassy hill, less than 100 feet from us. The only way I could describe this, is that it was a large dog of some sort. The werewolf looking sort, but not human in the slightest. It wasn't like anything I've seen in movies or books. It was white, but not solid; more like a cloud or a hologram. A very very real hologram, and a strong looking one too. I couldn't make out the pattern of fur or hair- just white. I'd say it was about 6 feet long, with a narrow snout that it kept low to the ground while creeping along.  The way it moved was so unsettling; it didn't walk like your average dog or animal. It reminded me of a rabid monster you'd come across in a scary video game... *before* it notices you. My friend and I were so quiet that I could hear our heartbeats, fearing that somehow that *thing* would hear and see us. You could make out its eyes; a dull red color, but again, not like regular dog eyes, but something else. It slunk past us, into a darker area that we couldn't see, and was gone. I remember my friend finally starting his car and slowly driving backwards a bit until we were far enough to reverse and high tail out of there at full speed.

On our way out of there was a strange sign that we hadn't seen before, with a name we couldn't make out, and the faded words, CEMETERY.

I've tried for years to find anything on "white dog with red eyes", "white wolf-dog cemetery", "see-through werewolf", and "Hawaii dog/wolf ghost", and found nothing. We didn't speak of this until years later; my friend freaked out when I did bring it up. He said he was hoping that he forgot he'd taken cough syrup, drank, or smoked weed before we hung out that night. Anything to make him believe what we saw wasn't real. He told me he tried to go back at one point, and couldn't find that hill we drove on. Over the years, I became less scared of the memory and thought of it fondly instead. It was pretty cool, since the creature seemed like it was just living its spooky creature life and didn't interact with us.

However, if it had even so much as looked in our direction, I think I would have had a heart attack right there. Fitting, since it was in fact, a cemetery.

Has anyone else ever experienced this?

I also have another dog-creature story... stay tuned.

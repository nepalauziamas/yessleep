I've had fish tanks for years. It's so peaceful to watch the various aquatic creatures swimming around, living their lives. It can be a lot of work and money at times but for me, it's worth the joy it brings me. Last month some disease or parasite wiped out everything in my tank, even the shrimp and snails. It was sad but...it happens.


From tragedy, a new beginning. I got to pick out all new fish, shrimp and snails. I never name the inhabitants of my fish tanks. It's not a rule, I've just never have. I don't know why I named this one, particular fish but I think bringing him home was a big mistake.


Satan was a bright red fish with yellow flecks and black stripes. I thought this was a clever name for a fish with these colors. The tips of his tail looked like they could puncture your skin if you touched them. He had an extra set of fins on the upper part of his sides that kind of looked like wings. There were no other fish in the store like him. Strange thing was, the store owner had where he came from. He sold him to me for $5. I scoured the internet, trying to figure out what kind of fish Satan was but had no luck.


Maybe it was a coincidence but on the drive home from the pet store, I very narrowly avoided 3 car accidents and tripped and fell in the driveway. I almost dropped Satan's bag. I kind of wish I had


I put Satan and all of his new, nameless friends in my tank. I was very happy with my choices, especially Satan. 


Although the other fish we bigger than Satan but they all seemed to be scared of him. This is very odd, when it comes to fish hierarchy, size is everything, in a freshwater tank anyway. There was no reason why they were letting Satan push them around. Maybe the extra fins scared them or he was doing something painful to them that I hadn't noticed. It didn't really matter but it was interesting.


Strange stuff started happening in the tank. One morning I woke up and all of the gravel was piled up on one side of the tank, the glass bottom was exposed on the other. There was nothing in that tank that could do that. Being such a mystery, I assumed it was Satan. I figured it was just something that type of fish did.


Another morning all of the decorations were in different places and had tiny bite marks all over them. 


On at least 6 different occasions, out of the corner of my eye, the tank looked like it was filled with blood but changed back to water once I looked straight at it.


Things got worse. Every few days one of Satan's tankmates would die. Fish die, no big deal. The weird thing was, the corpses were flat, not kind of flat, paper thin. They reminded me of empty Capri sun bags. It was like something was sucking out their insides, skeleton and all, leaving the skin. Even stranger, on the days I found a flat fish corpse, Satan was noticeably bigger. The amount of growth seemed to increase with every flat corpse.  I was starting to worry the tank is too small for him. 


Thats when I noticed something that really weird, just too convenient. On either side of his head were tiny black spikes that got longer and thicker every day. He's was growing horns! Fish come in all shapes and sizes but given his name, this felt too perfect to be a coincidence.


Eventually all of Satan's tank mates were dead. I didn't replace them, for obvious reasons. There was and upside, after that, I knew for sure that everything that happened in the tank was caused by Satan. He uses his new horns to scrape little 6's in the algae on the glass, never three of them together though, it was kind of disappointing. He also digs pentagrams in the gravel, not often but I have seen it. I took the tank decorations out. He'd damaged them so severely, they became eyesores. Not to mention, he had given them long, sharp points that I worried he would impale himself on. He was too big to have anything but him in the tank anyway.


The voices started after taking the decorations out. I heard them in every room but the one the fish tank was in. They are deeper than I've ever heard a human voice go and they never stop. It sounds like a church full of people with unnaturally deep voices praying softly in the next room. It's really faint so it's not a huge deal but every once in a while, there's a loud, blood curdling scream, that, I could do without.


Naturally I couldn't sleep, when I did, I had the most horrifying dreams you can imagine. They were about things like murdering my family, being a mass shooter, being in hell (which may not have been a dream) and countless other scenarios that ate away at my sanity.


The other day, I was scrubbing the algae on the glass and the water suddenly got so hot that it burned me, Satan was fine. Finally, this morning I woke up and impossibly, there was another little fish in the tank, it was a little Satan, I named him Satanito. I have no idea how it happened, there were no other fish in the tank to breed with but there he was, the spawn of Satan.


If anyone out there has any guesses about what type of fish Satan is or has had a fish like this and can offer advice, please don't hesitate to leave a comment.


Oh God, I just heard glass shatter in Satan's room.

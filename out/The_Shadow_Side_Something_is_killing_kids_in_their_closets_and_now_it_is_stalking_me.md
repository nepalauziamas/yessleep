Patricia Harding sat against her headboard, staring at her phone in the dark, knowing she should be sleeping but unable to get her brain to shut down. Her soon to be ex-husband was all she could ever think about lately and she watched his facebook page, refreshing every few minutes to see if he would post something. She needed something to confirm her hate for him, something she could point to at the divorce hearing to show them what a lousy piece of sh\*t Mark was. What he had done to her and their poor anxious son, Joel. He was getting worse. She could tell he wasn't sleeping enough and he never talked to her anymore. It was all Mark's fault. He was killing their son and he didn't care. He didn't have to deal with Joel's problems, or the school's accusations and complaints, or Joel screaming in the night because of his night terrors. He didn't...

  
As if the thought of it made it happen, she heard Joel let out a piercing and desperate scream down the hall. Her heart jumped for a moment but her fear turned to a dull resentful anger. He was having another nightmare. *That's the third time this week.* She thought about getting up but she knew what she'd find. Joel would be screaming and staring wide-eyed at the closet, terrified that there was a man in there, a shadow man who was going to get him. She remembered being scared of the boogeyman as a kid, of course he lived under the bed rather than the closet, but she never believed he was real. Not really. Not like this. 

  
She heard thumping, like Joel had gotten out of bed and she was waiting for the sound of his door opening, his footsteps running to her door and the familiar small silhouette of her son coming into her room for safety. Instead she heard another piercing scream and this one was different than before. This scream made her hair stand up and all the blood rush out of her head. She moved without feeling, throwing the covers off and stumbling down the hall to Joel's room, nearly breaking the door frame as she busted in. The room was dark, even the light from the hall seemed to do nothing. She grabbed for the switch on the wall by the door but felt it was already up in the on position. She flipped it up and down with no effect. She couldn't see the nightlight Joel had by his desk in the dark. Maybe that was why he was screaming. But why aren't the rest of the lights off?

In the dark, she could see a white hole on her son's bed where he should be but his blanket had been pulled aside and lay half on the floor. She looked around the room, holding her breath to listen. There was a smell, a terrible smell. Had Joel soiled the bed? No, it smelled rotten. Patricia could feel her heart beat in her ears, her chest was getting tight. "What were the warning signs of a heart attack" passed quickly through her mind, almost too fast to register. *Joel. Where is Joel?* She could see the window was closed. The panic was making her head buzz. 

&#x200B;

She started to yell his name when a movement from the corner of her eye made her snap her head around to the closet. Had it been open when she came in? It definitely wasn't open when she put Joel to bed. He would never have let her turn the light off without closing the closet completely. She flung the door open but couldn't see anything in the dark, the door blocking the light from the hall. "Joel?" She said it with more confusion than concern. He couldn't be in here. Never in a hundred years would Joel ever go into his closet in the dark. He wouldn't even go near it in the day. They had to take all the clothes out and buy a dresser otherwise he refused to get dressed. The only thing in there now was boxes. She kicked herself for leaving her phone behind in her panic. She looked around at the toys on the floor and recognized the shape of a cartoon dinosaur. It was a flashlight you could turn on by squeezing a trigger, opening its mouth and turning on the light. She grabbed it and almost dropped it because her hands had gone numb. When she pulled the trigger and the mouth opened she almost dropped it again when it let out an electric roar. She cursed under her breath and turned to point the beam into the door of the closet. Her screams woke the neighbors who called the police.

  
Detective Sendak got there as they were wheeling the kid out in a bag. The mother was given something to calm her down and had been taken to a hospital by another officer. The kid, Joel Harding, was found curled into a ball in his closet. The EMT said he had been dead before they even got the call. Sendak had talked with them before they took the body away and he'd never seen medics so shaken before. They said the kid had pulled his own knees into his chest so hard his fingers were buried in the kid's thighs, hard enough to pry the nails up like trap doors. They even said he'd managed to crack a few ribs. But the worst was his face. The pure terror frozen on that kid's face was something they had never seen before, let alone on a nine year old. They had to break the kid's fingers to get him into a flat position and rigor hadn't even set in. This was bad.

  
Sendak stood in the kid's room. He tried the light switch with a gloved hand and nothing happened. No power? The other lights in the house were on. There was a smell here, it was faint but it made his face tense. It was rotten but dry, like a dead cat left to mummify in a crawl space. Sendak turned on his flashlight, casting a bright white circle onto the toys and dirty clothes scattered on the floor. The sight of the toys and the childish mess made his chest tighten. *God, I hate it when it's kids.* He scanned the bed, showing where the blankets had been left a tangled mess, leaving a kid sized empty space on the bed. No sign of anyone else in the room besides the kid and his mom so far. Windows and doors were all checked and secure. The Mother claimed to have seen someone out of the corner of her eye but so far as he could tell there was no sign of anyone else in the house. The question of how someone could get in and out without opening a door or window was telling him it was just a trick of her mind. The closet was empty, except for a few boxes on a shelf above the clothes rack. Not even shirts hanging or loose toys inside. Odd. The smell was stronger here but more than that something was making the hairs on the back of his neck stand up. It was like he was being watched. Sendak whirled around, passing the beam of his light across the room, making the shadows cast by the toys move and stretch. Nothing. No one was there.

  
Before he left he had one thing pressing at his mind. He walked through the kitchen and into the empty garage. He clicked the light on and saw the rectangular shape of the breaker box on the side wall. What he saw inside left him stunned. Beside each switch was a piece of painter's tape with a word written in sharpie. Living, kitchen, bath 1, bath 2, porch, garage, bed 1, bed 2. One switch stood out from the others, facing the wrong way. Bed 2. The kid's room. It hadn't been flipped by a shortage or an overload. It was all the way pushed to the off position. Someone had flipped it.

The autopsy showed the kid had died of a heart attack. He had all the signs, increased blood glucose, high levels of adrenaline in the heart causing ventricular fibrillation, causing an abnormal heart rhythm incompatible with life. The coroner said he'd never seen a case in such a young patient. The kid had some antipsychotics in his system, risperidone to be exact, but is was a low dose and according to his records, he had been taking it long enough it wouldn't have had any kind of negative effect. As far as he could see, the kid was literally scared to death. 

When Sendak spoke with the Mother, the father had arrived at the station shortly before. They both looked like they'd just left a warzone. He asked the standard questions and he could tell they were both completely blind sided by this. The only tension came  when the father asked if they thought the medication had caused it. As soon as he said it, the mother turned on him, claiming he was trying to say it was her fault. He argued that he never liked the idea of his son going to therapy and he knew all those meds were just random chemicals they throw at problems to make you think they can help. The mother was shaking with anger now, her already bloodshot eyes streaming tears, but then she just collapsed into moaning sobs and the father looked like he had done something awful. He looked at the detective through his own tears and told him that Joel had been having a lot of anxiety issues lately. He thought it was just because of the divorce. Joel had been having nightmares about the boogeyman being in his closet for months. It was so bad they had to keep him home from school a few times because he would go days without sleeping. The man was apologizing to his wife with a shakey voice and reassuring her it wasn't her fault. She was just trying to help Joel. They both were. 

Detective Sendak finished his report later that night, claiming the death as accidental with no signs of foul play. Before he closed the file he thought about the breaker, and the smell, and the mother's claim that she saw someone. He hesitated for moment before filing the case as closed and leaving his office for the night. When he got back to his empty apartment he hit the switch for the lights, afraid for a moment the switch would click and nothing would happen. When the lights came on he shook his head and went over to his mini bar to make himself something to get the sounds of that mother's sobbing out of his head. He fell asleep with the TV on sometime in the night.

He was dreaming he was back in that kid's room, standing in front of the closet only he had no flashlight. There were no lights in the house at all. The open closet was a solid wall of black, yet he could see movement within, or maybe it was his eyes playing tricks. The smell hit him and it was worse than before. It made his throat tighten and swallow reflexively.  He woke up when a two points of light appeared to look out at him from somewhere in the shadow. He looked up to see his living room was dark. He thought he had left the hall light on before he passed out. The TV was white static and was the only light in the room. The smell must have been what woke him up because it was overwhelming. It smelled like a week old corpse sitting in a tub of its own juices. When he sat up and looked down the hall toward his room, there silhouetted in the window by the orange street light was a figure. It looked like a man in a long coat, his head just a black mass of stringy hair. Before his mind could even react, the figure took a smooth step to the side, disappearing into the doorway of his room. 

That was when Sendak woke up again, this time the apartment was blue with the light of early morning and the TV was chatting away. There was a buzzing and a vibration coming from his phone on the side table next to him. Still trying to shake the cold shock of his dream from his mind, he fumbled with the phone and answered. On the other end he heard the voice of the Chief. They got a call about another kid.

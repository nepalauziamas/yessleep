Patricia Harding sat against her headboard, staring at her phone in the dark, knowing she should be sleeping but unable to get her brain to shut down. Her soon to be ex-husband was all she could ever think about lately and she watched his facebook page, refreshing every few minutes to see if he would post something. She needed something to confirm her hate for him, something she could point to at the divorce hearing to show them what a lousy piece of sh\*t Mark was. What he had done to her and their poor anxious son, Joel. He was getting worse. She could tell he wasn't sleeping enough and he never talked to her anymore. It was all Mark's fault. He was killing their son and he didn't care. He didn't have to deal with Joel's problems, or the school's accusations and complaints, or Joel screaming in the night because of his night terrors. He didn't...

As if the thought of it made it happen, she heard Joel let out a piercing and desperate scream down the hall. Her heart jumped for a moment but her fear turned to a dull resentful anger. He was having another nightmare. *That's the third time this week.* She thought about getting up but she knew what she'd find. Joel would be screaming and staring wide-eyed at the closet, terrified that there was a man in there, a shadow man who was going to get him. She remembered being scared of the boogeyman as a kid, of course he lived under the bed rather than the closet, but she never believed he was real. Not really. Not like this. 

She heard thumping, like Joel had gotten out of bed and she was waiting for the sound of his door opening, his footsteps running to her door and the familiar small silhouette of her son coming into her room for safety. Instead she heard another piercing scream and this one was different than before. This scream made her hair stand up and all the blood rush out of her head. She moved without feeling, throwing the covers off and stumbling down the hall to Joel's room, nearly breaking the door frame as she busted in. The room was dark, even the light from the hall seemed to do nothing. She grabbed for the switch on the wall by the door but felt it was already up in the on position. She flipped it up and down with no effect. She couldn't see the nightlight Joel had by his desk in the dark. Maybe that was why he was screaming. But why aren't the rest of the lights off?

In the dark, she could see a white hole on her son's bed where he should be but his blanket had been pulled aside and lay half on the floor. She looked around the room, holding her breath to listen. There was a smell, a terrible smell. Had Joel soiled the bed? No, it smelled rotten. Patricia could feel her heart beat in her ears, her chest was getting tight. "What were the warning signs of a heart attack" passed quickly through her mind, almost too fast to register. *Joel. Where is Joel?* She could see the window was closed. The panic was making her head buzz.

&#x200B;

She started to yell his name when a movement from the corner of her eye made her snap her head around to the closet. Had it been open when she came in? It definitely wasn't open when she put Joel to bed. He would never have let her turn the light off without closing the closet completely. She flung the door open but couldn't see anything in the dark, the door blocking the light from the hall. "Joel?" She said it with more confusion than concern. He couldn't be in here. Never in a hundred years would Joel ever go into his closet in the dark. He wouldn't even go near it in the day. They had to take all the clothes out and buy a dresser otherwise he refused to get dressed. The only thing in there now was boxes. She kicked herself for leaving her phone behind in her panic. She looked around at the toys on the floor and recognized the shape of a cartoon dinosaur. It was a flashlight you could turn on by squeezing a trigger, opening its mouth and turning on the light. She grabbed it and almost dropped it because her hands had gone numb. When she pulled the trigger and the mouth opened she almost dropped it again when it let out an electric roar. She cursed under her breath and turned to point the beam into the door of the closet. Her screams woke the neighbors who called the police.

Detective Sendak got there as they were wheeling the kid out in a bag. The mother was given something to calm her down and had been taken to a hospital by another officer. The kid, Joel Harding, was found curled into a ball in his closet. The EMT said he had been dead before they even got the call. Sendak had talked with them before they took the body away and he'd never seen medics so shaken before. They said the kid had pulled his own knees into his chest so hard his fingers were buried in the kid's thighs, hard enough to pry the nails up like trap doors. They even said he'd managed to crack a few ribs. But the worst was his face. The pure terror frozen on that kid's face was something they had never seen before, let alone on a nine year old. They had to break the kid's fingers to get him into a flat position and rigor hadn't even set in. This was bad.

Sendak stood in the kid's room. He tried the light switch with a gloved hand and nothing happened. No power? The other lights in the house were on. There was a smell here, it was faint but it made his face tense. It was rotten but dry, like a dead cat left to mummify in a crawl space. Sendak turned on his flashlight, casting a bright white circle onto the toys and dirty clothes scattered on the floor. The sight of the toys and the childish mess made his chest tighten. *God, I hate it when it's kids.* He scanned the bed, showing where the blankets had been left a tangled mess, leaving a kid sized empty space on the bed. No sign of anyone else in the room besides the kid and his mom so far. Windows and doors were all checked and secure. The Mother claimed to have seen someone out of the corner of her eye but so far as he could tell there was no sign of anyone else in the house. The question of how someone could get in and out without opening a door or window was telling him it was just a trick of her mind. The closet was empty, except for a few boxes on a shelf above the clothes rack. Not even shirts hanging or loose toys inside. Odd. The smell was stronger here but more than that something was making the hairs on the back of his neck stand up. It was like he was being watched. Sendak whirled around, passing the beam of his light across the room, making the shadows cast by the toys move and stretch. Nothing. No one was there.

Before he left he had one thing pressing at his mind. He walked through the kitchen and into the empty garage. He clicked the light on and saw the rectangular shape of the breaker box on the side wall. What he saw inside left him stunned. Beside each switch was a piece of painter's tape with a word written in sharpie. Living, kitchen, bath 1, bath 2, porch, garage, bed 1, bed 2. One switch stood out from the others, facing the wrong way. Bed 2. The kid's room. It hadn't been flipped by a shortage or an overload. It was all the way pushed to the off position. Someone had flipped it.

The autopsy showed the kid had died of a heart attack. He had all the signs, increased blood glucose, high levels of adrenaline in the heart causing ventricular fibrillation, causing an abnormal heart rhythm incompatible with life. The coroner said he'd never seen a case in such a young patient. The kid had some antipsychotics in his system, risperidone to be exact, but is was a low dose and according to his records, he had been taking it long enough it wouldn't have had any kind of negative effect. As far as he could see, the kid was literally scared to death.

When Sendak spoke with the Mother, the father had arrived at the station shortly before. They both looked like they'd just left a warzone. He asked the standard questions and he could tell they were both completely blind sided by this. The only tension came  when the father asked if they thought the medication had caused it. As soon as he said it, the mother turned on him, claiming he was trying to say it was her fault. He argued that he never liked the idea of his son going to therapy and he knew all those meds were just random chemicals they throw at problems to make you think they can help. The mother was shaking with anger now, her already bloodshot eyes streaming tears, but then she just collapsed into moaning sobs and the father looked like he had done something awful. He looked at the detective through his own tears and told him that Joel had been having a lot of anxiety issues lately. He thought it was just because of the divorce. Joel had been having nightmares about the boogeyman being in his closet for months. It was so bad they had to keep him home from school a few times because he would go days without sleeping. The man was apologizing to his wife with a shakey voice and reassuring her it wasn't her fault. She was just trying to help Joel. They both were.

Detective Sendak finished his report later that night, claiming the death as accidental with no signs of foul play. Before he closed the file he thought about the breaker, and the smell, and the mother's claim that she saw someone. He hesitated for moment before filing the case as closed and leaving his office for the night. When he got back to his empty apartment he hit the switch for the lights, afraid for a moment the switch would click and nothing would happen. When the lights came on he shook his head and went over to his mini bar to make himself something to get the sounds of that mother's sobbing out of his head. He fell asleep with the TV on sometime in the night.

He was dreaming he was back in that kid's room, standing in front of the closet only he had no flashlight. There were no lights in the house at all. The open closet was a solid wall of black, yet he could see movement within, or maybe it was his eyes playing tricks. The smell hit him and it was worse than before. It made his throat tighten and swallow reflexively.  He woke up when a two points of light appeared to look out at him from somewhere in the shadow. He looked up to see his living room was dark. He thought he had left the hall light on before he passed out. The TV was white static and was the only light in the room. The smell must have been what woke him up because it was overwhelming. It smelled like a week old corpse sitting in a tub of its own juices. When he sat up and looked down the hall toward his room, there silhouetted in the window by the orange street light was a figure. It looked like a man in a long coat, his head just a black mass of stringy hair. Before his mind could even react, the figure took a smooth step to the side, disappearing into the doorway of his room.

That was when Sendak woke up again, this time the apartment was blue with the light of early morning and the TV was chatting away. There was a buzzing and a vibration coming from his phone on the side table next to him. Still trying to shake the cold shock of his dream from his mind, he fumbled with the phone and answered. On the other end he heard the voice of the Chief. They got a call about another kid.

    Diary entries of Daniel Hansen, age 7, collected by the office of Dr. Robert Atwell with parent's permission.
    
    3/12 Monday:
    I'm supposed to write in here. They said to write about what I think or feel. I don't know what to write.
    I had a bad dream last night. I saw a man in my room. He was scary. Mommy said it was just a dream, but I don't know. I hope he doesn't come back.
    
    3/13 Tuesday:
    I'm supposed to write every day I guess.
    I saw the man again. He goes away when the light comes on. He is scary and smells bad. Mommy says he isn't real. They don't believe me. I wish he would go away.
    
    3/14 Wednesday:
    Didn't see the man last night. I think if I leave the light on he can't come in my room. Maybe if I leave the light on he will go away.
    
    3/15 Thursday:
    Mommy wouldn't let me leave the light on last night. She doesn't believe me about the man and said I was wasting electricity. She hit me when I cried. 
    The man woke me up with bad dreams and I think he was angry he couldn't get in when the light was on. He doesn't say anything. He just stands there and gives me bad dreams and smells really bad.
    I'm tired.

Detective Sendak stood over the bed where Emily Planter, aged 11, had been when her older sister last checked on her the night before. The sister, only a few years older than the victim, was outside with the deputies sobbing hysterically while hugging her mother. Both she and her husband just looked lost, like their brains just switched to standby until they could make sense of what happened. Just like before, no open windows or doors, no signs of anyone else in the house. The detective took a long breath before going down on one knee and turning the beam of the flashlight to point under the bed. He swallowed hard as the light hit the face of the young girl. *Christ, I've never seen such naked terror in a face before. It didn't even look like the face of a kid, like the fear had added 40 years.* She was jammed under the bed so far back they were having to wait for back up so they could lift the bed and move it. How she managed to fit in such a narrow space to begin with was another question. Was she trying to get away from someone? Or was she forced under there? He had to get some air. The sight of the kid and that lingering smell was making it hard to think. On his way out he tried the switch. Nothing. He was willing to bet he'd find the breaker flipped as well. None of this made sense.

As he turned to leave, the EMS arrived with their back up to move the bed. The detective waited until they lifted the bed, revealing the small twisted frame of the girl, black with bruises and pushed so far into the wall the drywall had caved in. Sendak shook his head as he walked away, hearing the retching and cursing of the officers in the room. He looked in the garage but saw no breaker box. After a short search he noticed the dangling string of the attic door. The hinges groaned and the springs let out an atonal melody as he pulled it down and unfolded the ladder. As he looked up at the black opening of the attic he felt his chest tighten. That cold splash of fear on the back of his neck made him hesitate to go up. He had never felt this kind of fear before, even when he would find himself in dangerous stand offs with junkies in his rookie days. His fear cooled to anger and he forced himself to move up the ladder. As he climbed he felt like he was being slowly lowered head first into a pool of black water. He reflexively held his breath as he stuck his head into the dark. There was a flash of eye shine, like an animal, and he almost stumbled backwards off the ladder. He brought his light up like a pistol and swept it around the attic. Nothing. No one. No animal. He took a breath to quiet his heart beat in his ears and climbed the rest of the way up the ladder. As he thought. The breaker for the room had been flipped.

Before he left he was treated to the agonized screams of the mother as they brought out the tiny body bag with her youngest daughter inside. *I'll never be able to get that out of my head. Maybe thats good. Someone should remember it. Remember the pain of that mother in this terrible moment. Keep it with you to give you focus. You need to find out what or who is killing these kids.*

Back at the station, Detective Sendak sat with the father outside the conference room where the sobs and cries of his wife and daughter were only slightly muffled. When he asked about the kid having anxiety issues and nightmares the father looked surprised he knew. Emily had been dealing with a life long phobia of the dark. It had gotten worse when they made her stop sleeping in the same room with them. She was convinced there was a man under her bed and every night was a struggle to get her to sleep in her own room. They had been taking her to a therapist for the last few months to deal with it. Sendak asked for the therapist's information and any medications they had prescribed. When the detective asked the father about what had happened that night he started to speak but the words caught in his throat. He cleared in and began to explain shakily that they had decided to go out that night for the first time in a long time. Their oldest said she could handle it. He smiled as a tear fell from his cheek. He knew his oldest wanted them to have a night away from everything, she knew how hard things had been with Emily. His wife took a while to convince but she agreed. It was just one night. Just to decompress and relax. He began to shake his head, unable to get anymore words out. Sendak put a comforting hand on his shoulder and advised him to let the tears come. If you don't let your pain out it has a way of finding its way into the people around you.

After a long session with frequent pauses for crying and hyperventilating, he got the story of what happened out of the sister. Emily had fallen alseep on the couch as they were watching a movie and when the older sister got up to turn it off she carried her into her room and tucked her in. She was so tired she had forgotten to leave the door open a bit and the hall light on the way Emily always had to have it but she thought it didn't matter since Emily was passed out anyways. It was later she would hear the screams coming from her sister's room. When she came to the door she found it locked from the inside. She was sure she hadn't locked it on her way out. She had begun to panic before she remembered the lock could be opened with anything flat and hard. She pulled out her school ID and unlocked the door only to find the room empty and the lights not working. When she came in she saw something move across the room and disappear into the closet but it didn't make any noise so she thought it might have been a shadow from outside. She had to use the light of her phone to find Emily and she would see her in her nightmares for the rest of her life.

The coroner had the same conclusion as the last kid. She died of a heart attack brought on by a flood of adrenaline. She showed no signs of trauma other than what was done by the act of wedging herself under her bed. There were no signs she had been forced under there by anyone but herself and there wasn't even any medication in her system. *There had to be a connection here. Were these kids suffering from some psychotic episode? What triggered it? And what about the breakers? That had no explanation. Both the older sister and the mother of the first kid claimed they saw movement but heard nothing and no evidence of anyone else was found. No finger prints or fibers, no points of ingress or egress. It was like the work of a ghost.* Sendak shook his head, ashamed of the thought. *Lets start by ruling out ghosts, old man.* The therapist is the only connection these kids had, that was the only lead to go on.

  


I’ve always had this thing about me,ever since I was a little kid I would see these figures. Not full blown humans,well they were more…like shadows more like those stupid monsters that we all thought we would see in our closets or under our beds. But these were everywhere,I would see them out of the corner of my eye in the grocery store,or peeking out behind a door to watch me.

I’ve heard things like “oh it's just a sign you have been neglected as a child” or “no,you’re just opening your third eye”. Both statements could be true. I have always been interested in witchcraft and magic,and I was never the favorite child growing up,I was always the disappointment. But both of those things are stories for another time.I think this happened when I was around 15. That's when figures really started to become a problem,I could see them more clearly as if they were standing right infront of me.

And they started to show up more often, sometimes in groups.  I had gotten used to them lurking around me and watching me through the cracks of my door,and once even through my window. They all had something off about them like their fingers would be too long, they would be freakishly tall or unearthly thin. But this time they interacted with me. I believe it was around 4 A.M and I was drawing in my sketchbook,when my door started to shake. This had happened before,I found that they had a temper and I found it funny to annoy them. They really didn’t like it when I had my door closed. But my door was shaking,I rolled my eyes and shook it off,though the hairs on my arms were standing up straight.

The door opened,slowly, my chest tightened. This had never happened before. My door squeaked loudly as one of the figures peeked its thin head into my room,at this point I shoved myself into a corner of my bed. I was honestly scared of it,they had never moved things before while I was in the room. I sort of assumed they were capable of doing it but they had never actually done it before! The figure started its way into my room,my mind was racing, why was this happening now? Why am I scared?! It’s not actually going to hurt me right? I was grabbing at my sheets underneath me. A cold sweat broke onto my face. I was afraid to blink in fear that if I did, it would be right in front of me when I opened my eyes.

My eyes locked onto the figure as it slowly moved closer barely moving its thin legs,its arms to its side, its fingers too long almost dragging on the wooden floors that were creaking with every agonizingly slow step. It finally reached my bed,and my eyes started to quiver,from the dryness. I blinked.It was right in front of me right there just about 6 inches away from my face was its blank head,black and misty as always. Slightly see through but expressionless,I wanted to scream. I felt my face contort as if I was but no sound came out. I tried to figure out a way to get away from this thing but I was frozen in fear,a wave of a putrid smelling something filled my nostrils. The smell was so utterly awful I gagged.

I felt tears start to well up into my eyes. I could now taste that smell,it was like the aftermath of vomiting where you can still taste it in your mouth. I could see something moving out of my blurred vision. The horrific smell grew and grew,the figure was holding something,something dead,something rotting in its long bony hands. I feared the worst,what if it was my cat or-or my dog?! It was neither. I watched slowly as it held up a rat's decaying body,I was gasping for air yearning for a different smell than the one I engulfed in. It was holding the rat by its tail, I felt my eyes widening as a ripping sound occurred in the perfectly quiet house. It was ripping off the tail of the rat.

My heart dropped into my stomach,then leaped into my throat,making me gag. The tears that were in my eyes dried up from refusing to blink. I watched it dissect this rat’s body for what felt like hours. I had calmed down by the time it had finished dissecting it. I blinked for the second time since it came into my room,and when I opened my eyes it was gone.  I was left with a pool of blood and a rat's tail on my bed sheets in front of me. I still don’t really understand what happened that night. But I never stopped seeing them,but now,they open doors,windows,cabinets and even throw things across the room.  Any advice?

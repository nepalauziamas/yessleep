I was fond of playing tape backwards and forwards. My friends and I "concocted" schemes for playing the tapes backwards, removing some of the rollers, letting the tape run in other directions, or just flipping them over.

Of course it was interesting! What you don't hear:

the "sex machine" song was heard to a killer laugh. "Anishkam skes! aanyishkam skes! Anishkam SKES! Aa Mieszka to the SUP!". And the song "The painter that draws the rain..." sounded like, "The blue devil, the blue devil, comes to the doorstep with flowers..."

They were even going to rewrite the name of the tour on the singer's posters...

There used to be in recordings (there's no such notion now) popular disc-collections. Something like today's 10-in-one DVDs. They were called "American Disco Track!" Up to a dozen compilations came out.

So, I was playing back (selectively) such records and re-recording them on a cassette, in case I found something cool. And all of a sudden the usual intro to the compilation back sounded just creepy.

At first I heard, under eerie organ music, the shrieks of millions of people tortured from hell, when the music became smoother, a heavy voice sounded, clearly pronouncing the words-syllables: "Zhe-nya! It'-s Tru-E!! My-Na-Me!!!..." Then followed a short gibberish at the end of which the word HELL was clearly audible..." I, shocked, took the tape to an acquaintance, his huge black cat, peacefully dozing, heard the recording, EXCITED into the closed window!

I didn't do any more "flipping tapes".

I lived with a grandmother in an outhouse for a while.

There was an anteroom, a small kitchen, and one room. The front door was locked, the kitchen door was solidly bolted from the inside, and the room door was hooked.

So, one night I went to bed, it was a moonlit night, the room had three windows, and the moonlight illuminated it. I lay there, falling asleep, looking at the room, and suddenly I hear rustling in the anteroom... In an instant the dream was gone, I lay there thinking - how is it possible that everything was locked there? Then I heard footsteps (like that old woman's, shuffling), I heard the door from the anteroom to the kitchen opening... I sat down! Wow, a huge deadbolt is slid from the inside, and someone comes in the middle of the night, as if the deadbolt never existed! Why did the grandmother (or whoever) come here at night, what do you want...

I'm sitting on my bed, listening, and I hear the door to the room that's hooked open...! There's a curtain in front of it, so I can't see anything... I yell, "Who?" and at the same time I press the wall switch to turn on the light. I noticed that even in the moonlight, the light was brighter than usual and the room was unusually bright. I am surprised to find myself pressing my finger again, but I cannot press it, my finger sinks into the tight honey, the switch is almost pressed, but I do not have the strength to "press" it all the way. And then - I turn my head to the bed I am sitting on, and I see myself lying there peacefully asleep!!! I was astonished and fell back on the bed. I turned on the light - there was nothing unusual in the room. I rushed to the door - it was locked as I had closed it, there was nobody in the yard...

(at work, in my "cell" room, where we sometimes sleep.) The room is locked from the inside.

At night, toward morning, I sleep and see either a very real dream, or a dream I had while I was asleep, that I wake up to someone pulling the blanket off me on the floor. At first it's just pulling, and then it starts yanking. I half-asleep realize that it's not a person, but I'm not afraid either (in light of yesterday's descriptions). I try to pull the blanket back, my arms feel cotton. It's hard, but I'm starting to get to the edge that's being pulled. It feels like a blanket is caught on a fishing rod and the line is being yanked. And here I am, muttering the first prayers that come to mind, almost pulling that corner of the blanket with my hands to grab the "cheeky guy", and the stretched section starts trying to "leave", moves smoothly right through me and by the wall "that" has already let go of the blanket. I saw only in the darkness by the wall two tiny red lights of eyes and woke up finally. It glanced angrily and jumped right through the wall.

Another night I was falling asleep with headphones on to music, it was a very hot summer, and I was lying there without my shirt on. Suddenly, something sticky fell on the middle of my chest. I shake it off with my hand, jump up and turn on the light - it was a big slug. I don't know how it fell from the clean white ceiling, painted with paint.

Okay, it happens. I go back to sleep, I can't sleep, I listen to music... Again! Again something falls exactly in the middle of my chest! What on earth is that! I jump up and turn on the light: I have crushed a big locust with my hand... And again all around me the walls and ceiling were clean, I could not understand.

I put out the light, went to sleep without headphones, with the intention of falling asleep. I close my eyes - THIRD time again!!! Again, something fell right into the same place, but it can't be such a coincidence...

The third time it turned out to be a huge caterpillar, light green. Or not a caterpillar, but such a worm, I do not remember exactly. I sat down on the bed and tried to comprehend.

The impression was that the ghost living in the old factory was deliberately picking up critters in the yard and throwing them at me.

There was no other explanation, the windows were high and covered with mosquito nets. The doors were locked at night.

Me and my husband have always been different. This is no simple relationship. I am him, he is me. We are the same. We look the same, say the same sentences and always turn our head at the same time. This is not all, of course. He is not related to me but people think so. If you were a mind reader and read his mind, you would see blank. If you read my mind it’d be mine and his thoughts combined because we are one. There is no separating us. It is impossible. 

Recently he’s been acting strange. Going out at night during weird times, not showing me whats going on. I know though, of course. I know everything he does. He’s not cheating, but attempting to steal something from someone we’ve known forever. We’ve known this woman since we were children. She knows us, she understands us. At first I questioned an affair with her and him but after further telepathic thought, it is not. I followed him one night, straying far behind. I saw him carrying a book while exiting the woman’s house. Unfortunately this is not any book. This is the book that started our relationship, the book that brought us together. My childhood book in fact. I always believed that he was the little boy from this book because of how perfectly they match up. Everything about them is the same and the girl that he helps represents me. This book is how my life has gone and I believe that my life will continue to follow the book. I wanted to cry when I saw him holding it, immediately I felt a pain in my head as he held it tighter. He told me that this book has been out of the library for far too long and it needed to be returned. I cried as he told me that it’s for the best and that this book does not effect our relationship. It did, terribly. 

I don’t feel connection with him now and I know he didn’t take it to the library,  he’s burnt it. I felt the burn on my skin as he did it. We are no longer special and now some normal couple that only look similar. I cannot hear his thoughts. I cannot see where he is headed. He’s acting terribly weird now. Last night I saw him sharpening a knife which isn’t too weird of him but he did it with a certain elegance. He walked over to me holding it proudly in front of him almost looking as if he’s about to stab me or something. He was excited to see me and told me to walk towards him while he stood still. I did as asked. I no longer feel a connection with him so I have been objectifying myself to him so he will stay and never leave me as we once promised. I walked towards him and he pushed the knife forward stoping it just before it hit my stomach.

He didn’t stop it because he wanted to. The woman whose house he took the book from stood behind him and with a press on his neck, he fell forward. The knife would’ve stabbed him through his neck hadn’t she grabbed it before he fell. “I told him this book is a bad idea. I told him so many times. Him having to resort to this is truly low, I cannot help but be disappointed. I’ll be back, child. Do not think you are alone.” and with that she was gone. No one knew how old she was or where she came from. She has long wavy white hair and a strong body. 6’3. I know a lot about her, too much possibly. That is why she’s so protective of me, I think. She doesn’t really care but pretends to. 

I stand in shock and roll him over, sitting and waiting for a response. “I’ll be back soon.” Soon can be an hour, a month, a year. You never know with her. I grab a pillow and put it under his head with a blanket on top of him. All of a sudden, as I was about to doze off to sleep, I feel a liquid hit my leg. I open my eyes slowly and see that my legs are clouded in a pool of blood. I feel faint suddenly and my head hurt like crazy. The door opens and the woman who had protected me walks in with 3 way too familiar people. I wanted to get up and argue with them, but I felt too weak. I knew they’d argue with me and try to fight. No one interferes. I only sit in silence and fall forwards into the pool of blood that I have now only realised, came from my husbands head…

This is not the only thing he has done in an attempt to hurt me.

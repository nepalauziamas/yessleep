This is it. No turning back now. I'm going in and I'm not coming out until I find out what happened. For my brother. That first part is really for me. I'm sitting on a park bench as I type this in Ashe County North Carolina in a town called Jefferson. For some context my whole family is dead. Well now they are. My parents both killed in a freak accident when I was 15. No aunts uncles or grandparents so it was just me and my older brother Jameson. He became my legal guardian when he was only 22. I grew up and went to police academy just like he did. We were both cops. I say were because we both quit in 2020. 

This year we decided It would be fun to hike the Appalachian trail. Go all the way up and be done by July. Just us, some beers and the truck and backpacking gear. It's 3 weeks in and we made it to Jefferson. People around town seem pretty skittish but I just chalked that up to being an "out of the way" town. We met a very nice shop keep and he asked what we were doing. We told he we were going camping and the color drained from his face. " you're what?" He said.
 " going camping. Probably up near north fork." My brother said. As we continued the shop keep became more and more nervous. I asked what was wrong but he didn't say a word. He rang us up and all he said was " I hope you've got a bullets in that gun on your hip" as he motioned to my concealed firearm. He she continued "I hope you have a cross as well". Little creepy but whatever. We headed out

As we set up camp at night I had an uneasy feeling that we were being watched. And I couldn't seem to shake it. Something felt very off in those woods and I didn't know what it was and I was slightly scared but as a police officer being scared was something I didn't feel often so I just took it off as best I could had a beer take the bag with my brother as we started grilling some burgers we bought at that shop earlier.

That night I woke up with a bit of a startled. I called for my brother's but there was no response. He was gone Jameson was gone and I didn't know where he went. I figured my mind was just playing tricks on me and he was probably just offer a piss. I waited. And waited. And waited for 1 hour. He didn't come back. He didn't call. So I did the only logical thing I could think of I grabbed my firearm I grabbed my headlight and I went out looking for him. I was calling yelling practically screaming for 15 minutes just walking around in the woods. damn Woods. felt like I was going in circles but even though I was going in circles I never found my way back to Camp that night. Round and around and around.

I kept walking and walking and walking. Then all of a sudden *pop* *pop*. Gun shots. *pop**pop**pop**pop*. 10 more shots came after that and I knew that whoever it was had an empty magazine because it sounded like 9mm shots it is everybody knows don't have more than 17 rounds in a 9 mm pistol unless you have an extended magazine which is illegal in North Carolina so I don't know who would. And then I heard something that would shake me and I think will continue shaking me until I die. A scream. The most blood-curdling scream that you've ever heard shot out through the forest. I was terrified. I had been shot at had knives thrown at me been in fist fights and this is the first thing that truly scared me. And then I heard in the scream something that would never leave me. I heard my name being called. It was my brother I knew it was him who else would be calling my name out here. He was screaming and calling for help he wanted me to help him and I couldn't help him because I didn't know where the scream was coming from.

I started to run through the woods running as fast as I could in the screams were getting louder and louder so I knew I was getting close. And then I ran face-first into a shed. Little brown shed out here in the middle of the fucking Woods. I think I got knocked out. Because when I woke up it was nearly daytime. The sun was coming out birds were singing. I took a look around the shed for a few minutes nothing too exciting about it just a small brown shed out here in the middle of nowhere weird but there was nothing else I could do. By the time the sun was up I was able to find my way back to camp. I decided my best course of action would probably be going to the Jefferson police or the sheriff or where the f*** was in charge. But before then I decided to go on a quick look around. I went in the same general direction I went the night before I get it was dark so I couldn't tell where I was but I was an avid tracker and Hunter so I was pretty much able to tell which way I went the night before.

I found the spot where the shots were shot off. I knew because there were a bunch of shells everywhere empty casings no sign of a firearm though. It looked as though half a shot hit a tree about 30 yards away from where they fell. I didn't know what happened. I'm not sure I want to. I have to assume that my brother is dead unfortunately. That's how he was screaming it sounded like he was really hurt. I went down to the Jefferson Sheriff's Office. They were useless those prize there because Small Town Police usually are. They said I should wait 48 hours and then come back if my brother doesn't show up. So I left I went and got a hotel and now I'm typing this. I'm going back out there. I'm going to find out what happened to my brother. And I'm going to kill whatever caused him pain. If you're reading this right now it means that maybe you could help me. If I don't update this post in a week... Please come Ashe County. Go to the North Fork. I'll leave signs of my travels behind so that you can find me. Wish me luck. And may God be with me.

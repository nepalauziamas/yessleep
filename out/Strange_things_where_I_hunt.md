Background: I hunt on a 110-acre property in rural Missouri. I started hunting here last December and have gotten to know the owner and his family pretty well. I had some great hunts to close out the 2021 deer season, but weird things started happening around the property in April 2022 and are continuing now.

April 2022: Things started out great. My first year ever hunting for wild turkey started with a bang as two mature Gobblers walked into the field I was sitting in just after sunrise on opening day. The closer of the two Gobblers was in full mating display when I raised my shotgun to take aim. Seconds later I was getting up to go tag my first bird. With one of two tags filled, I had to wait a week until I was able to tag another turkey. 

The following Monday, I left my house early to be back in the woods before sunrise. Just after 4:50 AM, I was driving down a country road whipping through the curves and hills to get to the property with enough time to get ready. About 4 miles from the property the road made a bend to the left. As my headlights came around the bend, they illuminated the edge of a cattle pasture and a shed right along the road. On the roof of the shed was an all-white humanoid figure with its arms and legs spread out. The figure was up against a nearly vertical section of the shed roof and looked exactly how you’d imagine a person trying to cling to a steep surface would look; legs and arms spread all the way out to maintain center-of-gravity against the roof. But just as quickly as my headlights had illuminated the figure it was left in the dark as I continued around the bend. I came to a screeching halt in the middle of the road almost immediately. I looked back over my right shoulder but the screen on the dash of my truck was reflecting off of my windows and I couldn’t see. I tried rolling down my windows for a better look, but it was just pitch black. I sat there for a second trying to decide if I should turn the truck around for a second look, but I decided I didn’t want anything to do with whatever was on the roof of that shed and I pressed on to the property. 

I couldn’t shake what I had seen that morning and spent a vast majority of the day looking over my shoulder. Nothing happened the rest of the day and I headed home.

May 2022: After a week of work I was headed back out to hunt again on May 1st. The humanoid figure was out of sight out mind all week, but I couldn’t help but think about it as I drove around that same bend in the road. This time, it was just a shed. I arrived at the property just after 5:00 AM, turned my headlights off and hopped out of the truck to unlock the gate. 

Quick description about the property; it has a gated drive that leads down a long winding drive to a large cabin, barn and a couple of sheds. The owner is out there about 50% of the time but comes and goes between the cabin and his house just outside of St. Louis. 

Anyways, I walk up to the gate to unlock the padlock and instead I found it laying on the ground a few feet from the post the gate is usually chained to. I knew the owner wasn’t going to be there that morning and I assumed he just dropped the lock or something, no big deal. So, I hopped back in my truck and drove down the driveway with my headlights still turned off as usual to try and keep things as dark and as quiet as possible before hunting. As I got closer to the cabin, I could see a white light moving around inside. Like I said, I knew the owner was not out there, so I quickly backed my truck up the lane towards the gate and parked just off to the side of the driveway. I tried calling him, but he didn’t answer. I grabbed my pistol from the center console, got out of my truck and started walking towards the cabin. I kept my distance from the cabin as I walked around the perimeter. There were no vehicles and no signs of forced entry that would have set off the security system and alerted the Sheriff. As I worked my way around the cabin the white light was still moving around inside. I decided to get closer and looked in through one of the kitchen windows. I saw a white orb glowing about 3’ off the ground. I watched it for a few seconds, and it stayed perfectly still in the middle of the room. I started feeling uneasy and turned my head to look back over my shoulder but when I looked back through the window there was nothing there. The cabin was pitch black, no lights anywhere. I ran back to my truck to wait for daylight. 

I still wanted to hunt… but I wasn’t prepared to venture deeper into the woods until I could see. After about an hour the sky was starting to get lighter and my phone rang. It was the owner calling me back. I told him about the padlock, and he said he must have forgotten to lock it and maybe an animal bumped it off. I did not mention the white orb in the cabin to him in fear that he would think I was insane. Once it was light enough, I went and hunted the rest of the day. It felt like an eternity sitting there all day waiting for a turkey to show up, not being able to get the white orb out of my mind. I finished out the day without seeing a single thing. The turkey season closed the next day, but I decided I had seen enough weird stuff in a two-week period. I wasn’t planning on being back until at least August to prepare for deer season and figured that would be enough time to let my mind cool down.

The summer came and went with nothing eventful because I didn’t spend any time out there but as soon as I went in mid-August to hang up some tree stands and trail cameras, things started getting weird again.

I can fill you all in from August until now in another post if you’d like.

Also, I have told a few people about this. My girlfriend thinks I’m just seeing things. My co-worker that also hunts said it was probably a meth head clinging to a shed roof. A few others have said “damn that’s crazy”. My old roommate of 5 years from my military days it the only person who really believed me. He didn’t have much of a response but knew I wasn’t messing with him.

He said it louder “Did you know there’s 1.5 gallons of blood in an average person” One of the girls at our lunch table looked at him in disgust, and looked away. 

Robert was a weird ass kid. None of us were friends with him, and we didn’t pay any attention to him, so it was a surprise to see his greasy self sitting at our table. His unwashed bangs covered his forehead, but a large patch of acne was still visible. His small, half moon glasses made his eyes look like they’re bulging out of his head. 

“Can you not sit here” one of the guys said, and another one chuckled at the blunt remark. Robert smelled like straight shit. Was even worse he was sitting right across from me. He got up and laughed, as if he was one of us. He was not one of us.

We thought that was the end of Robert, and no one really put the thought of him back in our minds, till he sat back down the next day. “Did you know it takes 1-3 minutes to die from a stab wound?” He then pointed at the girl at the end of the table “You’d die quicker” he chuckled awkwardly and everyone stared in confusion. “Fuck off” one of the guys said. “You’re so weird, go the the fuck away” Robert just stared, then began to speak again “Scared?” he then got up, and walked away.

I told one of the security guards on what Robert kept saying, and they said he won’t be eating lunch here anymore. But surprise, surprise, Robert returned the next day. “Did you kno-“ he was knocked out of his seat by one of the kids. His chubby self hit the ground and his glasses broke on impact. Nobody stood up for Robert, not even the kids behind us. Everyone knew he was a total freak.

Robert stood back up again, his nose was bleeding like a faucet. “Youuu can’t hurrrtt me!” he choked out. The guy swung again and pushed him away from the seat. He backed up into another table and crashed into a group of guys. He got up, his clothes soaked in food, and hurried off. 

I didn’t feel bad for a second. He was a total creep, and everyone assumed he was going to come back looking for a fight. We moved tables towards the back of the lunch room, and waited. Robert walked in, and immediately started walking towards our new table. Fuck. It was a stupid plan but we thought maybe it would’ve worked.

“Did you know brain activity can last 10 minutes after you die” he said, then pointed again at one of the girls. “I’d smile at you in those 10 minutes” “Did you know if you say some shit like that again I’ll beat the shit out of you?” one of the guys said, and stood up. Robert backed up, and chuckled. “I’ll fucking kill you!” he screamed, and the guy jumped over the table. Roberts face met the ground in 10 seconds. 

We all hoped and prayed this was the end of Robert, and luckily it was. A week after this, a 14 year old girl named Samantha was pulled out of a river. All evidence pointed towards Robert murdering her.

Life went on without the creep at our table. But at the end of the day, we have to give credit where credit is due. 

It really did only take us 1-3 minutes to kill Samantha.

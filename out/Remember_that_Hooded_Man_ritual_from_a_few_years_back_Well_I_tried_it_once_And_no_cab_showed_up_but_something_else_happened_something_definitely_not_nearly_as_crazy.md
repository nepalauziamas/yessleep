If you remember the Hooded Man ritual, there were some specific items you needed to have on you. 

One of them being a phone ☎️ specifically either a rotary phone or land line phone with a cord, that had been unplugged.  


Other items included salt, for protection, and maybe some other protective herbs like sage or something. 


The whole idea is that you could call like a ghost cab or something from “the other side” and it would appear outside your house and you could ride it through the I don’t know, other dimension.  


Okay, I don’t really believe any of that, but one day I tried the ritual out. I didn’t bother with the sage, but I did put some salt in a zip and seal baggy, (like that would do anything).  


I had an old phone that hadn’t been used in about fifteen years, and I decided that would be perfect. (This was a corded phone, btw, not a touch screen).  



There were lots of posts online with a specific phone number you were to call, with specific instructions of having to count to 13 between dialling two different rows of numbers.  


Anything, I dialled those digits and then did what the instructions said to do which was to say into the phone “I need a cab”. The whole premise this game, btw is just silly, and absurd, but I did do this.  


I ended up leaving that room, and going to another part of the house. I would periodically glance out the window to see the road, and nothing there, of course, because this is all made up. 



There was however, a weird thing that happened, and, seemingly no real explanation for what did happen.  


About an hour after my time in that room, my grandpa, who had heard a commotion, goes into said room to find his copy machine broken. On top of it is his printer, which had managed to fall on top of it from a shelf above.  



Now look, this sounds like a coincidence but it’s creepy. What are the chances? What are the chances that a printer, which had been mounted for years, just suddenly comes down like that? And breaks a copy machine? 




I also should mention, said shelf was bolted, bolted, with iron bolts, and iron brackets, into the wall. Meaning, every bolt had to give at once, and both brackets, causing it to crash into the copy machine below. 
 



There was no cab, no scary ride through the other dimension, nothing like that remotely happened, but what did happen was still weird. It still goes against my personal logic which I believe is based in everyday experience.  




It also proves that a bag of salt does Jack squat to protect you.  




Anyway, take what you want from this story. I certainly don’t believe in some ritual actually working that way where you can actually make a car appear. Everything about that screams “Ludacris!” Yet, the story has something to offer. 



The question arises of itself “did I, by partaking of this ritual, evoke something weird?” Maybe. 
 



Definitely not what other people evoked, but still something. 
 



If you’de like to try this for yourself it’s still around on places.  


I still have no idea what happened, I would still like to hear everyone else’s experiences with this ritual.  


Did anything happen for you? Or was your experience empty handed?

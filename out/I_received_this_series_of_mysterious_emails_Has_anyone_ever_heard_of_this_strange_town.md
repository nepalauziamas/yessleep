As a journalist, I sometimes receive strange stories from people. Most are self-important narcissists spouting tales of their own heroism. Others are just wackos looking for attention. But occasionally I receive something truly odd and unexplainable that defies all my preconceptions.

Attached below is a series of bizarre emails I received over the course of the past two and a half months. At first I dismissed them as a hoax, but as I delved deeper, many of the references made by the sender checked out. At present, my editor will not allow this story to be printed until I gather further supporting evidence of its veracity. I have contemplated what to do, and whether or not to accept the invitation proposed in the fourth letter.

I publish them here now to ask the Reddit community what it thinks, before I undertake a meeting with this person. Are these the words of a sane man? Has it happened to anyone else, as the writer asks? And most of all — could any of this be true?

Here is the first letter, reposted in its entirety:

*TO:* [*Rand.Curtis@xxxxxxxxxxxx.com*](mailto:Rand.Curtis@xxxxxxxxxxxx.com)

*FROM:* [*emccreary@xxxxxx.net*](mailto:emccreary@xxxxxx.net)

*SUBJECT: Nowhere*

*——————————————————————————————————*

*Dear Mr. Curtis Rand,*

*I am a big fan of your articles in the New York Times. I know you often publish the true stories of your readers. I ask your help in getting my story out to the public.*

*I am writing this letter in the hopes of finding others out there who have experienced the same strange and horrifying occurrence that I shall relate below. My suspicion is that there is a community of other survivors out there. With your help, perhaps we can come together, share our stories, and through this process begin to understand what happened to us, who was responsible, and what their larger agenda might be. In this way we can heal. But also, I believe we must warn others of the hidden dangers lurking among us. As I now know…*

***No one is safe.***

*My story begins in Bennington, Vermont. A small town in the foothills of the Green Mountains. I was raised there. A friendly sort of town where everyone knows your name and your business. This does make for its share of rumors, including a few unkind ones that circulated about me from time to time, but that’s beside the point.*

*You may or may not know that Bennington itself has a bit of a strange reputation, stretching back to its early founding. One story is often told about a stagecoach that passed through the town when it was just a small mining hub. Witnesses aboard reported an awful racket and were set upon by something monstrous from the woods that overturned the coach, nearly killing them in the process. The travelers were so shaken that they vowed never to return to Bennington. Hunters were sent out to find the culprit, they came back with nothing but stories of eerie noises and throaty growls that seemed to emanate from every corner of the dark forest.*

*Native Americans had their own legends about the region, declaring the Green Mountains a cursed land, where the four winds met and created chaos. It was said that magic rocks populated the mountainside and surrounding woods. If a person should be so unlucky as to step on one, he would be sucked into the belly of the earth never to return.*

*I didn’t put much stock in such stories growing up. They seemed like the kind of tall tales locals used to scare off outsiders and visitors. Pure fantasy or superstition. There are, however, some very real mysteries about our town that I’ve sought to solve for the better part of my adult life.*

*Bennington is known for a proportionally high number of unsolved missing person cases. In a period of 5 years from 1945 to 1950, six people mysteriously vanished under unusual circumstances. One story tells of an old man on a bus who vanished between stops, leaving his luggage on the rack and a bus schedule on his seat. He was the only person on the bus at the time and the driver never saw him get off. Another tells of a young woman walking the woods a hundred yards ahead of a group. When she turned the corner of the path, she disappeared into thin air never to be seen again. The other tales describe an experienced hunter who vanished in the woods with a single shell casing left behind in the river; a boy who disappeared from a parked car; and a young couple who left* *a bar in the early evening but never returned home.*

*I know these stories as cold case files from when I was the Sheriff of Bennington. I was the youngest person ever elected to that office, at just 31 years of age. At the time of my election, I had promised that I would solve these cold cases and restore the people’s faith in law enforcement. But ultimately I failed at that task. What’s more, a few other people went missing during my tenure. I failed to solve their disappearance as well. Frankly, it was the downfall of my career, if I’m being honest. I worked so damn hard at those cases that Dr. Singh said I had a nervous breakdown and I was put on leave. I retired shortly thereafter.*

*Now I’m just a farmer.*

*After retirement, I moved into a small ranch house with my wife Ava and son Daniel. That’s when the strange occurrences began.*

*My father farmed beef cattle, so it was a natural move for me. Ava wasn’t too happy though, having to “downgrade her life” as she put it. Things were a bit rocky between us ever since. But Daniel didn’t mind it much. For a kid his age, the open fields and animals were like a playground to explore. He loved to catch fireflies in the summer or help me get the cattle moved from pasture to pasture. And he always had so many questions. Like the time a baby calf got caught in barbwire and was trashing around like mad as I tried to free it. The calf’s mother was bellowing something awful, charging at me. Daniel asked, “Don’t they know we’re just trying to help them?” All I could answer is: “They’re too stupid to know.”*

*Daniel’s a sensitive kid and he didn’t like that answer, but it was true. Farmers do have a strange relationship with our livestock: we feed them, care for them, heal them when they’re injured, only to take them to be slaughtered when the time is right, so we can make a few bucks. Must be damn confusing to the animals. But when you’re trying to eke out a living for your family, one can’t be bothered by the larger philosophical implications. It’s enough just to get through from one day to the other.*

*I remember the first night Daniel reported a monster outside his window. It was three in the morning and I was half asleep when the boy knocked on the door. I went, as I always did, to comfort him from bad dreams. He’d starting having them ever since I lost my job. Ava said he was empathetic, taking on the stress of his father and letting it fester in his little body. I hated to think that was true. I hoped it wasn’t. It wasn’t right for a boy his age to carry all that.*

*This time he told me it wasn’t a dream.*

*“It was looking in on me when I slept,” he declared. “I saw it with my own eyes.”*

*I didn’t want to discredit his feelings. I only told him there’s no such thing as monsters. But it wasn’t getting through. So I told him something my old man had told me when I was kid, when I was scared that one of them dinosaurs from Jurassic Park would climb in my window and get me.*

*“Here’s a baseball bat. You keep this under your bed,” I told him. “And if that monster, or whatever-it-is, shows up you hit him in the head with this bat. Don’t hit him too hard though, you might hurt him. You don’t want to hurt him, do you?” My goal was to make him feel empowered, that the monster was more scared of him than he was of it. But it didn’t take. He was still scared, despite my best efforts.*

*Just as I was coaching him up on how to swing the bat —* ***something shot past the window so fast I nearly had a heart attack.***

*Now I have to admit, I didn’t see it clearly. I just saw a shape. And I heard a clatter on the roof as it scrambled down the shingles and onto the grass below.*

*Daniel looked at me and said, “I told you,” in a haunting way that made me eat my words right then and there, and I determined not to patronize him in the future.*

*I grabbed a flashlight and that bat and went out to investigate. Daniel wanted to follow but I kept him inside. And Ava was none too pleased about all the commotion. But I have a curious nature, so I couldn’t just let it go.*

*Outside, all was quiet. But as I snooped around I found that the lock to the barn had been torn off at some point in the night. And when I mean torn off, I mean TORN off. It’s a metal hoop what someone had managed to rip right off the door itself.*

*I pushed aside the doors and looked inside. I remember thinking it was about as terrifying a moment as anything I can remember. But I just had to know what was in there.*

*I pulled the doors all the way open wide. Light from the moon was streaming in, casting shadows all about. Hay bales were stacked in the loft. That’s when I saw two eyes peering out at me. I didn’t know if it was a person, an animal or what. A cold chill ran down my spine. I had that strange feeling that I was seeing something* ***I wasn’t meant to see.***

*So I slammed the doors shut and called the police.*

*When they showed up they found nothing. Nothing in the barn. No footprints on the ground. Not a thing to verify that I saw anything out of the ordinary at all. They tried to tell me it was probably just an owl, but I knew it was something else. I felt like a fool. And it wasn’t doing the boy’s fears any good to see his dad so worried. So I too chalked it up to an overreaction.*

*But I knew. Something was there. Something strong enough to rip a lock apart with its bare hands. Something that could scare even a fairly practical man as myself.*

*The second occurrence happened a few weeks later, when Daniel was out collecting fireflies. I had been drinking a bit that night, I’ll confess, and Ava and I had gotten into it a bit. She didn’t like me drinking. We’d made agreements about such things over the years, but I thought I caught her on a technicality.*

*“You said you weren’t going to drink no more,” she yelled.*

*“No, I said I wasn’t going to get drunk, no more.”*

*That’s when Daniel interrupted us and came running in, talking about “The Monster.”*

*Well, once again I went out to investigate, marching out across the field to the tree line. I saw where Daniel had dropped his glass jar in a haste. The fireflies had long since fled their enclosure.*

*Through the trees there came a light rustle, as if something was moving through the brush. In desperation I cried out, “Hello!”*

*The rustle stopped. Whatever it was had heard me. At first I wasn’t scared. An animal will do that. A fox or a coyote. Just freeze in fear when they hear someone call out to it. Again I said, “Hello.” And then, “Who are you?” I repeated the phrase several times.*

*Eventually, there was a response.*

*A deep guttural pronunciation.*

*It said: “Whooorrrrrryoooo.”*

***It was mimicking me.***

*Again I had that sense of otherworldly fear. I didn’t want to run. I didn’t want to show weakness. It wanted me to know it was there. It wanted to make me think* ***it was human.***

*Several days passed after that. Nothing too remarkable happened. Though people reported seeing army helicopters flying over the town, searching for something with their spotlights. It was the talk of the town. I, myself, witnessed a caravan of military vehicles, snaking through the country road beside my farm one night. Silent and cold. But there wasn’t a military base within a hundred miles, so what were they doing here I couldn’t say.*

*These events all precipitated a rather unsettling event that occurred just before the Fourth of July.*

*Daniel and I had set out to bring a couple of our cattle to market, including the big bull, Mr. Pepper. Daniel asked why we had to get rid of Pepper, and I told him that the old bull had become mean in his aging years. “If he got out, he could hurt you or your momma.” Daniel nodded, unsure what would make a bull get so mean after a number of years. I told him that “some animals are just too dangerous to keep around.” We continued driving. And then, suddenly, I hit the brakes —*

*Just a few miles down highway 9, a woman ran out from the trees and crossed into the road. I stopped just short of her, but it wasn’t enough to save her. A dairy truck, coming the other way, plowed right into her, sending her body flying.*

*I told Daniel to wait in the car and I raced out to help. There she lay in the ditch beside the road, a tangled mess. The woman’s hair was dirty and matted. Her dress was ripped and stained.*

*When I rolled her over, I got the shock of my life. The woman staring up at me through glazed eyes, was Abby Murrow.*

*That name won’t be familiar to you, but it damn sure was to me. The Murrows had been our neighbors five years ago when I was still Sheriff. We lived in town back then. Abby was the wife of my pal Wade, who’d served in the Coast Guard with me. The two of them had twin girls, sweetest things you ever saw. The family enjoyed the outdoors. Camping and hiking. A fair bit of canoeing. Five summers ago, they’d gone out into the Green Mountains for a weekend camping trip.*

*Sadly, they never returned.*

*When the Sheriff’s department investigated, they found a fully intact campsite. Hot dogs sitting burned on the charcoal grill. No signs of distress. Nothing to indicate any foul play at all. A trail of footprints led into the camp, but none returned.*

*And so it was my greatest shame that I had been unable to solve the case of my own friend and his family. I began to doubt myself. And what good is a Sheriff that doesn’t feel up to the task? This was why I resigned. Not the mental breakdown the doctor tried to accuse me of. It’s important you know that. It’s important you know that I’m well, and not some crackpot. I’m as sane as the next man. I did the noble thing, to pass the baton, since I never could find the Murrows or any trace of them.*

*Until now.*

*I looked into Abby’s eyes. I had a million questions, but I first tried to assure her she’d be all right. I told her to breathe. To stay calm. I shouted out to the truck driver, who had ambled down the ravine after me.*

*“Call 9-1-1!”*

*I looked back at Abby and I could see in her eyes I was going to lose her. I had to know. “Abby. What happened? Where have you been? Where’s Wade? Where are the girls?”*

*“The shepherds…” was her cryptic reply.*

*I didn’t know who she meant. I knew of no Shepherd family in the region. But I didn’t even know if she meant the name of some people or actual shepherds. Then I noticed what she was holding in her hand. It was a knife. More of a makeshift shank to be honest, with a taped-up handle. She lifted it up to show me.*

***There was blood on that knife.***

*“I got one of them sombitches,” she said, through the faintest trace of a smile. Before I could ask her to explain, her stare became fixed and the smile drifted away. She was gone. She died right there in my arms.*

*When Sheriff Lieu came, I explained all this to him. Bill Lieu had been my deputy when I was Sheriff, but had now finally taken the mantle of his predecessor. I had no ill feelings towards him, but folks had told me that the feeling wasn’t mutual. They said he always resented the way I did things back then. That he resented being my subordinate.*

*Still, he listened. Made his report. But nothing much came of it. The search for the missing Murrows hadn’t resumed in any significant way. And the whole investigation itself seemed relegated to the back burner of the department.*

*I didn’t like the way Lieu handled things after that. Someone told me once that he was tied into the meth dealers outside of town and got a cut to keep quiet, and so didn’t dig too deeply into anything that may implicate them in a crime. I didn’t believe that, but when people start talking that way, there’s probably something about the man that was off. Whatever it was, something kept him from delving full on into this case.*

*That’s when I started digging deeper. I became obsessed for a while. Tracking down old leads. Talking to folks. Going through old case files. It didn’t help my relationship with Ava much, either. We started getting into it more often than normal. I tried to get my mind off things by doing chores around the house, like fixing the screen door and painting the cattle fence.*

*One morning, when I was about halfway finished with the fence, our new neighbors Percy and Ester came by.*

*Percy was a good ole boy, with a big pot belly and an easy way about him that always made me laugh. His wife Ester taught down at the high school. She was whip smart and all the kids loved her.*

*Percy and I got to talking about all the strange things going on in town.*

*“You see them black helicopters t’other night, Everett?” He asked me.*

*“I did. What the hell they doing here?”*

*“I hear they’re watching us.”*

*“What’s so interesting about our little town that they’d want to watch us?” I chided.*

*“I reckon it has something to do with the power plant.”*

*There was a defunct power plant forty mils outside of town that had been the source of much speculation and rumor in Bennington. People said it was the site of some kind of top secret government experiment, because soldiers were often posted outside the gates. I know well enough that it’s just because the US wants to keep its nuclear secrets secret. But folks around here are prone to superstition.*

*“Naw,” I told him. “I’m sure there’s a logical explanation for all this. People like to tell stories, but the truth is usually much more simple.”*

*That’s what I thought back then. I believed that to my core. But I guess I was just naive. My eyes are open now.*

*As I said before, Ava and I had been at each other’s throats for a week or so. But we always made up by the end of the night. She’d make me promise to lay off the whole Murrow case, and I would. Said it wasn’t good for me to dredge up the past. Then she’d catch me with a fistful of old crime scene photos in the attic the next day. This went on and on. But she’s a good woman. I fell in love with Ava just out of high school. She was out of my league then and still is now. The truth is, she just wants the best for me. I know that. And I love her for it. And I regret all the fussing now. It retrospect, it was pointless.*

*I believe it was a Sunday night in late July or August when that wild electrical storm hit. Knocked out all the power in the house. Rain was pouring down in sheets. Thunder shook the house and lightning flashes lit the sky.*

*We ate that night by candle light.*

*And after Ava went to sleep, I dug into my hidden stash of Wild Turkey and wandered my way out to the barn to have a few plugs so I wouldn’t be disturbed. Must have had more than my share, because I woke up the next morning in one of the barn stalls.*

*When I staggered back into the house I found that Ava and Daniel were both gone.*

*It wasn’t like Ava to take off like that. Especially not even leaving a note. We hadn’t been fighting enough for that. When I searched around the house, I found the truck was still in the drive, so someone must have picked her up.*

*The power was still out. And even my cell phone was dead, because I couldn’t charge it overnight. And we didn’t have a house line anymore.*

*I tried to start the truck to go look for them, but it wouldn’t turn over. That wasn’t caused by the blackout. I don’t think an electrical storm could do that. But it did explain why they hadn’t taken the truck with them.*

*The most curious thing though, was the fences. When I walked out, they weren’t painted. But as I just told you, I had nearly painted half the fencing around my property. But here it was, just raw wood again. That’s one thing I just couldn’t figure at the time.*

*So I had no choice but to walk into town.*

*It’s about two miles from my driveway to the town square. Not an awful walk. Kind of nice, actually. Pleasant with the birds chirping and bees buzzing.*

*Except there weren’t any bees or birds on this walk. Everything was dead quiet. Eerily quiet. It made me nervous, actually. That kind of quiet is very unsettling. You think there’s something wrong with your ears.*

*Nor did I see a single car on the road. No one to hitch a ride with.*

*But that’s not the worst part. The worst part was when I got to town. The most fantastical thing I’d ever experienced. And the most frightening as well.*

*I stepped onto the square and instantly I knew it. Deep in my gut I could feel it. That horrible way you feel when it finally sinks in that something really bad has happened.*

*The entire town square was deserted.*

*Not a single shop open. Not a soul around. Not a car driving the circle. Not a damn light on. They were nowhere to be found. Nowhere at all.* ***The entire population of Bennington had vanished overnight!***

*Mass disappearance cases in the United States are rare but not unheard of. By their very nature though, they are usually impossible to solve. And here I was, the guy who couldn’t solve any missing persons cases, now faced with his own wife and child missing — as well as the entire town. Ultimately I did figure out where they were. But I’ll get to that later…*

*There’s so much more I need to tell you, but they’re saying I’m not allowed to write any more today. I’ll post the rest when I can.*

*-Everett James McCreary*

So that was the first letter I received. The others grow increasingly more strange. I checked into the town he mentioned. A quick Wikipedia search for Bennington, Vermont will reveal that at least this part of the story is true. There are some strange stories connected to that place. I also contacted the local sheriff’s department. They confirmed him as a former sheriff.

I began to take his words more seriously after that. You’ll see how bizarre this story gets in the next letter [\[here.\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/xm61nl/i_received_this_series_of_mysterious_emails_has/)

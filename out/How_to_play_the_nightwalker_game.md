The nightwalker game is a risky game which promises after winning it to fulfil your biggest dreams. But if you loose you will  experience  something worse than death. You start the game with opening all doors and windows in your house wide open and turn off all the lights in your house expect the ones in your bedroom. Its important to have an annual clock ,a flashlight and a pocket knife with you because all power will turn off when the game starts. After you did that you will light a candle and sit down with closed eyes and wait till midnight. At point midnight , when the lights in your bedroom turn off and your candle gets blown out , you will know that you successfully have started the game. At this point you should notice a tall man standing outside your house window with no face and no hands. This is the "nightwalker" which you will have to hide from. This man will enter your house and if you did all right hopefully not find you. If you otherwise forgot to close any window or turn off any light he will appear every night outside your house and will try to find you. So make sure you prepared everything correctly. But it is not as easy as it sounds. There are a couple of things to be aware of :

1. If you hear the nightwalker entering your house(which he will do) try to make no noise at all because he cant see or feel but he can hear very good. 
2. If you hear the nightwalker screaming immediately cover your ears and do not move , he is trying to locate you with his screams.
3. If you hear one of your loved ones calling you down for dinner , etc no matter what you do do not do what they say at the point of the game there is nothing else in your house only the nightwalker and you.
4. If the nightwalker is in the room in which you are hiding try and hold your breath for as long as you can , it will minimize the risk of him finding you , if so ever you slowly notice him going towards where you hide , cut a vein at your arm. This will be your last chance.
5. Try to constantly remain calm , because the nightwalker gets attracted by your fear and it will make it more easy for him to locate you.
6. When the time hits 3 am you need to change your hiding spot (it would be optional if you would move to another room) try not to run into the nightwalker while looking for another hiding spot.
7. No matter how tired you feel DO NOT FALL ASLEEP . If you fall asleep you will be trapped in the house forever with the nightwalker searching you. And you do not want that. You can even try to shine the flashlight in your eyes to keep yourself awake.

These are the main rules to follow while playing the game. If you pay close attention , you can hear the nightwalker tapping where he wants to go next in morse code , this could be really helpful. However , the game ends when the sun raises , you just have to light the candle again , close the windows in your room and then blow the candle out again with closed eyes. If you then hear a loud scream you know that you successfully completed the game the nightwalker will disapear. The next day you will get your reward. After the game ends there will be left a note on your bed. The message on the note will most likely say :"  -.-- --- ..- / ... ..- -.-. -.-. . ... ... ..-. ..- .-.. .-.. -.-- / .-- --- -. / .. / .- .-.. .-. . .- -.. -.-- / .. -- .- --. .. -. . -.. / - .... . / - .- ... - . / --- ..-. / -.-- --- ..- .-. / ..-. .-.. . ... .... ". If it however says something different or is even completely blank ,  burn the letter. I wish you the best of luck if you want to play this game , even tho i would not recommend playing it.

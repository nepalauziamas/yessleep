I knew something was wrong when my father awoke me that night. 

"You have to stay quiet princess, it's like a game!" he would whisper, 

"We can't wake up your mom. I'm taking you home now." 

I was confused but young, and still covered in the haze of sleep as he led me out of the house, to his truck in the driveway. 

Even my attempt to place the small bag I'd been allowed to pack in the trunk of his car was denied. 

"Just hold it, Brin," he said, pulling me back from the trunk. 

"We need to be quick." 

I cast a look back at our house as we pulled off. A modest, two-story home in the suburbs, my room, was the second window on the top. 

It would be the last time I saw that house for years. 

I remember his face, illuminated in the passing street lamps as we drove. The expression he wore was unlike any I'd ever seen on his face before. 

In my youth, I attributed it to sadness. He and Mommy had been fighting a bunch recently, and I had heard the word divorce shouted. Which meant something, even to a nine-year-old. 

Now, I know it was a sort of guilt I hope to never understand. 

We drove for hours before the fog of sleep and confusion faded enough for me to ask, 

"Is Mommy meeting us there?" 

My father's grip tightened on the wheel. 

"Your Mother is - she's not a good person, Brin. She wanted to take you away from me." 

I was confused. I knew my parents yelled and sometimes fought, but in my young mind dad had never hurt me. 

Why would my mother ever want to do that? 

Wasn't my father doing that now? 

He told me we were going to a new house. 

That it wasn't ready yet, but he was building it and he would make sure it was the best house I'd ever seen. 

I would be able to design it with him; put a pool in the bathroom, a slide in place of stairs…

By the time we arrived at the location, and his car was pulling to a halt, I had long since fallen asleep; my mind full of whimsical ideas about my new home. 

I arrived to a grim reality. 

The car was parked in the wake of the skeletal frame of a small house.  

It was by no means a palace. In fact, it was quite a bit smaller than the one we already had and sat in a lot surrounded by forest that made it difficult to discern direction. It was only partially completed, missing several walls and flooring in parts of the second floor.

Just a little ways away from it at the mouth of the driveway sat an older model camping trailer, which would serve as our home for the following year. 

During that year, I learned not to ask about my mother; not to question why I couldn't call her, or when I'd next see her. 

Father's mood had always been prone to sudden shifts, almost exclusively towards anger. It had been the reason for so many of the fights he and my mother had. The ones where I would try my hardest to hum some song from memory or bury myself in a book, in the hopes of distracting myself from hearing the screaming and slamming.

Even though Mom wasn’t around, and his temper had for the most part seemed under control, I knew not to push things.

In the best of circumstances, he’d dismiss any question about my mother’s absence. Usually pinning the blame vaguely on her, and sulk in silence for hours afterward. 

During the worst, which came far more often, he wouldn’t say a thing. Simply glaring at me before stewing in a silent rage that always felt like the quiet before a familiar storm. 

I’d never known him to blow up on me. In fact, it was usually the opposite, growing up I was his princess, whom he seemed to feel needed to be protected from what he viewed as my mother’s “bad influence”. 

He’d never put his hands on me, apparently reserving all the worst of his wrath for my mom, but she wasn’t around now, and I wasn’t going to take chances. 

Though he’d never yet been violent toward me, a part of me was always certain, deep down; that he was capable of it.

During those months, a strange new reality began to settle in, and with it, a new day-to-day. It’s strange how easily a child can adjust to a whole new way of life.

It’s funny how malleable you are at that age. No matter how strange, or peculiar the new situation may be, children just assume the adults in their life know best, and adjust; allowing it to be their new normal.

I was homeschooled on the days my father wasn't working an odd job or construction gig. 

When he was, I occupied my time reading the books he would bring me back from town in the trailer. Above all, I was expected to stay on the property, told never to wander too far from the trailer. 

The hours home alone would grow boring, and in the boredom, I found the perfect breeding ground for longing. 

My mind would turn to thoughts of my mother and my old life.

I missed my mother, my old room, and my old home; though I knew better than to express as much to my father, who never took well to discussion of our “past life” as he called it.

I would try and stave off the longing, flipping through the tiny picture book I had managed to sneak from my room when I’d packed, struck by an odd urge at the time. 

It contained my favorite photo of my mother and father, from months before I was born at their wedding. 

I had always thought my mother looked like such a princess in the image; her white dress and long brown hair that I had always taken after, styled beautifully, a far cry from the usual exhausted mother appearance.

When that failed to suffice, I took to wandering that skeleton of a house that stood like a surfacing corpse beside us as a distraction.

Despite my father's many warnings against its safety, there was something about the creaky old shell of a home, slowly filling out day by day into something livable; that  filled me with an odd sort of comfort as I wandered its halls.

That all changed one day, entirely without warning save for my father ripping out much of the foundation of the house. 

He had been returning home from work visibly stressed more and more recently. He'd been more insistent than ever that I stay within the clearing, not even venturing out into the forest anymore. 

Any questions on my part were dismissed with a brief "safety" in reply. 

Then, one day, father didn't come home on time. 

5 o'clock came and went, sunset soon following - and he hadn't returned. 

It wasn't until long after dark, and I'd fallen asleep rife with worry, that I heard the crunch of his tires on the gravel path leading up to our lot. 

He didn't even come to the trailer, going straight for the ghastly form of the house, far more ominous in the moonlight - a sledgehammer over his shoulder. 

That was the first night of his digging. I watched from the window as he entered the house, and began slamming the head of his hammer into the concrete. 

The quiet of the forest was pierced by the constant thud of metal on cement, chipping away slowly. 

I fell asleep that night to the incessant, almost haunting *clack* of his hammer against the newly-laid concrete. 

"It's - it's not right, not yet. The cement was…too porous. tThe whole thing would've sunk over time." he'd offered briefly in explanation when I questioned him at breakfast the following morning about what I'd seen the night prior. 

I knew something was wrong though. The woods didn't feel the same after that day, and the house even less so. 

Suddenly, its halls felt so*…hollow*, foreboding.

In the days following that night, when I was home alone, and the wind whistled through the hollow halls, I was certain I could hear a voice singing. 

There was a woman, her words indistinct, but an immeasurable sadness present in her tone as it echoed in the frigid air of the night.

It was around this time that the dreams began plaguing me.

They were always the same. There was me, the house, and a woman. The house stood like the remnants of something old and dead. Its wooden frame was replaced with pale bone, and thin veins running in place of the errant wires. 

And at the center of the basement, she always stood. 

The woman in white, her face covered with a veil so thin and ethereal in the wind it appeared made of spider silk. 

She sang a song so sad, so…*familiar* that it always sent a pang of sorrow through my heart. 

I approached, a sense of unshakeable familiarity driving me forth. My hand would reach out for her veil, half expecting my fingers to tear through it at contact and - 

I always woke up. My face would be wet with tears, and an air of dread would cling to me for several minutes. 

I learned very quickly not to mention the woman, the voice, or the dreams to my father, after his reaction that following morning. 

I'd never seen him so pale when I brought it up; his face screwed, and his head seemed to turn on instinct to cast a glance down the hallway.

He busied himself that entire day, refilling the ruined basement floor with cement and sequestering me to the trailer for safety reasons. 

For the next few months, things progressed as normally as could be expected. The dreams continued, eventually becoming an accepted part of life. 

Thoughts of my mother plagued me, all the questions I couldn't ask piling up. I missed her. I wondered if she knew where we were. I doubted it. Even at that age, I could now understand that my father kept me cooped up here for a reason. 

That summer, my father made a few friends on one of his latest jobs, and they helped him finally finish its construction. 

I watched as covertly as I could from the window of the trailer, staying out of sight whenever they were around, per my father's orders. 

He was so proud in those final months of its construction. 

"Now, we truly get to leave it all behind…" he would say, gripping my hand. 

The look in his eyes was always so…desperate - *pleading*. As though he were trying to convince himself. 

Then he'd wipe it all away with a smile as he looked on at the rapidly forming house before us. 

By the end of the summer, the house was complete. It was a modest, two-story house, painted a vibrant yellow, which had been the color of my choice. 

It was a far cry from the castle my father had initially promised, but it was a home and was surely going to be a step up from the beat-up old trailer. 

We spent the following weeks transforming the empty shell of a house, into something of a home. Painting the walls in the small living room a regal sort of mahogany, my own room covered in facsimiles of unicorns, golden-haired princesses, and other things my father saw as being fit for a little girl's room. 

The dreams continued in the weeks following our move into the house but they…they changed in subtle, but disquieting ways. 

For one, the woman's song now didn't sound quite so distant.

From the very first night we spent in the house, I had the dream of the woman. It was different this time, her voice seeming not to come from somewhere outside, but carrying through the pitch-black halls of the house. 

It was as though the sound originated from somewhere deep within. The way it seemed to almost carry through the walls, airy and chilling, as though the house itself were singing her somber tune. 

Over that time, I was constantly exhausted. 

My father started to notice something was wrong; as I nodded off during dinners, but he obviously couldn't begin to suspect what. I often gave the excuse of not being used to my new room which seemed to quell his worries.  

He bought the first T.V. we'd owned since leaving home. 

It was a cheap thing, but I was thrilled to have something besides books to entertain myself with, and he was fine with that so long as I avoided adult programs and only used it under his supervision. 

There were other effects of my lack of sleep. Ones that were odd, and harder to justify to myself. I was beginning to hear that strange singing even in my waking hours. 

Whenever I was just about to nod off, it would start, as if my dreams were beginning just a tad too early. I learned quickly not to react too much when the singing began its echo from behind our basement door. 

It was clear that, whatever it was, father couldn't hear it. 

Time began to lose its meaning after almost two years. 

My sleep schedule was shot and paired with the fact that father insisted I remained within our little section of the woodland, my mind remained constantly in an odd haze. 

So when I began seeing the woman in white in my waking hours, I could only question my own eyes. Like her song, I tried to ignore her when I caught sight of her pale, incorporeal form. 

She moved through the halls, her form like the static of a television, cloudy and fuzzy like she was made of snow.

Where she passed the dull red of the wall seemed to rot and decay, revealing necrotic muscle and tissue beneath. She would drift by, singing that song that felt so familiar, until she reached the basement door. 

Always the basement door. 

There she would wait. Turning her head to watch me as if waiting for me to open it. 

For months, I never did. I tried my best to act as though I saw nothing at dinner - when it seemed she appeared the most - keeping my eyes locked on my father as she'd wander past, on her way to the basement door. 

If I waited long enough, she would disappear, fading into nothingness. 

On some particularly disconcerting occasions, she stood behind him. Staring down at him through that veil. Though I couldn't see her face, I could feel hate radiating from her. 

She remained like that until father had left the table, at which point she continued on to the basement door. 

As time seemed to pass in a blur my resolve began to wane. 

My father began to catch my gaze "wandering" more and more often roaming as if following something he couldn't see. I could tell it was freaking him out by the worried looks he'd shoot me, or the way his gaze would fall on the basement door. 

When the night came that I finally broke, my father was away. 

As the construction season passed, he'd taken a job a few nights a week at a local warehouse that kept him away from home until the early morning hours. 

The house was mine in those hours, yet never was I allowed the luxury of feeling alone. Even when I couldn't see her, I could hear her; a waking dream superimposed over reality.

I was eating alone at the dinner table. The TV blaring some local news channel in the other room to stave off the silence, when her song began. 

I tensed out of instinct, doing my best to keep my eyes on my food as her form drifted into the room. My father was gone, which meant there was one place she would head, as she did so often. 

The basement. I watched from my peripheral as she moved past the other end of the table.

Perhaps it was a year's worth of exhaustion and rising paranoia finally making me break, but her song….that strange, hauntingly familiar hymn, words always just out of reach, I felt like I knew it. 

I slowly chewed the chicken from my microwaveable dinner, and two things occurred to me almost simultaneously; like lights flicked on in the darkness. 

One was an idea, the other a dawning realization. 

I dropped my fork. Before I could even consider my next actions, I was up from the table, pushing the chair back, and rounding the table. 

She stood, flickering like an old movie outside of the basement door. For once, I looked, not bothering to try and hide the fact as I approached. 

I think by that point, a part of me already knew that the woman was no mere effect of exhaustion. She was real, or at least not limited to my imagination. I had always tried to justify the faint creaking of floors as she passed over them, but I always *knew*. 

My heart raced like a jackrabbit in my chest, a smell reminiscent of when I sat inches from our old box set as a kid singeing my nostrils. 

The paint on the walls seemed to bruise, turning yellow, and then gray as they rotted with her passing. 

Before I could think, I reached out and touched the nearest wall, running my finger along it as I approached. It was wet and brittle to the touch, a thin trail of clear slime extending with me as I pulled back. 

She froze, coming to a stop at her usual destination, and turned to watch me expectantly. 

A cold dread sunk its claws into me as I stared into that veil, holding me in place for a moment. I mustered the fleeting wisps of courage I had. 

With a sigh, I pulled open the basement door. 

Her reaction was immediate. 

She shot forward, passing through my arm as though it were nothing. I yanked it back, gasping as an icy wave of pins and needles filled the limb. 

Her head tilted just slightly, as though curious about my reaction, but she turned in an instant disappearing in a faint glow into the darkness below. 

I know no rational person would have followed, but I was young and that curious familiarity seemed to pull me forth. 

It was odd to think but I almost felt more comfortable with the phantom woman at this point, than I had around my father since the night he'd returned with the hammer. Something about him had just seemed… different. 

I followed the woman into the basement, the steps groaning underfoot. A dank, damp smell had already come to fill the air, intermingling with the dust left by construction. 

With each creak of the steps as I approached the cold floor beneath, the knot of anxiety in me pulled itself tighter. Afeeling of dawning dread starting to eek past the patchwork wall of bravery I'd built. 

I waved my hand blindly for the string attached to the singular light bulb in the basement, eventually finding it, and pulling. 

Nothing. A second and third pull returned the same results. 

The woman's faint song rose from behind me. 

I turned to face her. Her faint glow illuminated the other half of the room. I shuddered. 

It would have to be enough. Slowly, I began to approach her.

She was kneeling, head lowered into her hands, as she sat before a spot on the concrete. I recognized it immediately. It was a slightly off shade of gray, different from the rest of the room.

Newer. 

The sound of that incessant clattering, my father's hammer against concrete, rang in the back of my mind. 

So much had changed that night. It had been after that, that the woman’s song began to haunt me. It had seemed to be yet another point in my life at which things had taken a turn for the unfortunate, a strange catalyst for a dark shift.

The catalyst for all of it being the night my father took me from my home. 

The woman raised her head from her hands as I approached, staring up at me with that same silent expectance that she possessed waiting outside of the basement.

“What? What do you need me to do?” I asked, my voice shaking with desperation and the ever-present, instinctual sort of horror always at the back of my mind as I stood in the presence of the impossible.

She lifted her arm, pointing one pale, unclear finger towards a dark corner of the room, illuminating it as though holding a pale blue candle. In it the corner leaned my fathers sledgehammer.

It took only seconds before I understood what I was being instructed to do, what I had been called to do for months. I made my way to the corner, gripping the handle of the thing in my small hands. 

I strained, kneeling as I lifted the hammer from its corner, maneuvering it around and over my shoulder - before approaching her again. The woman stood, a fluid almost instant motion as if she’d moved from one still to another, stepping to the side of the strange point in the cement.

The air buzzed with indescribable energy, thick with a tension caused by the presence of something impossible and the sheer insanity of what I was engaged in. 

I stared at the woman for a moment, almost trying to peer beneath that veil, unsure for a moment of what I was about to do. She gave me the briefest nod, and in that instant I felt certain of what I must do.

I raised the hammer as high as I could manage swaying lightly under the weight, and brought it down with a *clank* of metal on concrete.

A few chips of cement broke off, but little else. I did it again, and again. The progress was slow, almost negligible at first and though I wondered if I was even making progress, I was spurred forth by the woman's gaze. 

There was something down there. I suppose I might have realized that deep down, the night my father took to it with a sledgehammer; his excuse always seeming lackluster. 

I continued like that for hours, until my palms were slick with blood and sweat, tearing open from the friction. I was drenched, my hair clinging to my forehead, and my pajamas to my skin. 

My arms were on *fire*, but I continued hours passing until eventually, I had made a significant dent in the concrete. 

There was something there, visible just beneath the dust and debris. 

It was wrapped in cloth, white at one point, now stained a deep, *rotten* gray. 

The smell hit me immediately. I dropped the hammer at my side, stumbling away as my knees buckled and my eyes watered. 

The cold pit that had been present inside of me from the moment my father woke me up in my room stretched until it enveloped me. 

The stench was like meat long gone bad, almost like the cat that had been hit outside of my house when I was little and left out for the summer sun. 

It was death. Pure and unfiltered. I felt tears running down my face, and fought off the urge to relieve my bladder as my body shook in response to the smell. 

The woman turned and faced me, and in an instant, she stood before me. 

One of her hands rose to my face, and I started to cry, but she continued, holding it as close to my face as she could without passing through it. 

I could feel a radiating coolness from her, faint but there, and she kneeled until her veil was only inches from my face. 

She began to sing. That familiar wordless hymn of hers. It echoed through the empty room, filling my mind with a sudden, much-needed calm. I felt my heartbeat slow, and my breathing returned to a steady pace. 

Upon seeing my reaction, she turned her head towards the crater I'd made. When she turned back, I knew what she wanted me to do. 

I nodded, steeling myself and moving towards the reeking hole in the ground. 

She followed at my side, and it brought me a comfort I hadn't felt in years. I kneeled at the side of the fabric, holding my nose with one hand, and reaching out to grab at the edge of the cloth with the other. 

I pulled it aside. My heart dropped, and my stomach flipped in my gut. There was the head of a corpse beneath, petrified, its gray skin clinging to the bone; and its hair - 

Its hair was almost a reflection of my own long dark locks. 

"Mommy" I breathed the word, my throat tightening, tears springing forth. 

I turned my head to face the woman who had been haunting my dreams, searching for some sort of answer. 

As I looked to her, the veil over her face always obscuring her features began to dissipate - fading like smoke in a breeze - 

And the pale, almost blurry countenance of my mother stood before me. She gazed down at her body, a look of sadness noticeable in the faint visual snow of her features as she looked at me. 

And all at once, recognition bloomed, and *everything* clicked. 

The familiarity of her song, a song whose words I'd long since lost to time, but whose tone I would always remember as the lullaby my mother sang to me when I was younger. 

I'd seen her pale dress before as well, in the singular photo I'd managed to bring from home. It had *always* made her look like royalty. 

My stomach turned, as I realized why my father had been acting so suspicious. He had killed her. He had killed my mother, burying her beneath my very feet. 

I felt like I might be sick. 

"Mommy" I breathed again, an overwhelming mix of sadness, longing, and hope filling me all at once. 

She kneeled until her face was at my level, a sad smile spreading across her features. 

"Why? Why did you make me do this?" 

She frowned, her colorless eyes somehow glistening with emotion at that. 

It confused me at the time, but in hindsight I imagine she needed me to know. Needed me to understand I wasn't safe with my father. 

It immediately occurred to me that her color seemed to be fading. That otherworldly sort of pale blue was now a faint white, like a light being gradually lowered. 

I could feel somehow that I had done it. Whatever it was she required of me, my mother - what remained of her at least, was not long for this world. 

Her face fell, then screwed in an instant. A look of fury blazed over her expression. 

My heart almost burst from my chest. 

She turned to face the basement door, then turned back to me, her expression stern. 

She extended one rapidly fading hand towards the singular window in the basement, leading into a window well outside. 

From somewhere upstairs a door slammed shut.

“Brin? Where are you, baby?”

My heart sank as though thrown in quicksand, as my father's voice carried down the stairs. I felt a fear, unlike anything I have felt since shock my system as I glanced back at the body of my mother. 

I couldn’t know what he might do to me for uncovering it, and I didn’t want to. He had killed my mother, there was no telling what he might be capable of doing to me. The realization that my father had become someone unrecognizable to me was a chilling one.

I had left the table in a hurry, leaving my food nearly untouched and the basement door wide open. If he came looking, which I was certain he would, it would be a brief matter of time.

That icy burst of pins and needles exploding in the skin of my back drew my attention, and I turned to see what was left of mother gesturing frantically at the window, her meaning finally clicking.

“Brin, are you down there? I’ve told you it’s not safe…” Father's voice carried from nearby. 

He couldn’t be too far from the basement door now, just a bit of hallway and some steps still separating us. 

I hurried over to the window, wincing with each slap of my feet on the concrete. I began to fumble with the lock, each of my father's approaching footsteps from the floor above making my heart leap farther into my throat.

Finally, it twisted with a pop, and I slid the window open, letting in a rush of the frigid night air.

“Brinley!” His voice was louder now, hoarse with a blend of rising anger and panic. 

The phantom woman, my mother, watched me with a longing expression as she kneeled beside her own exposed corpse. Her eyes communicating everything she was unable to say. 

“I love you too, Momma.” 

She nodded her head once, pointing again at the open window. I climbed out standing up in the window well and shooting her one last glance. 

She kneeled, almost prostrating until her face was within inches of her corpse. Its mouth snapped open as if some invisible string had been yanked, and in that instant with one last glance my way, she was gone - disappearing inside the mouth of the corpse, which snapped shut behind her. 

A faint, dull glow seemed to settle just beneath its skin, and for just a moment, I could see her laying there as she used to be. Her beautiful face merely sleeping, and then it was gone. The glow fading, leaving only the dried husk.

“Brinley Jane Adams, answer me, damn it!” My eyes widened with cold panic. He was coming, just at the top of the stairs now by the sounds of it.

The thump of footfalls on the basement stairs sprung me into action, spurring me forth like a frightened animal. I strained to pull myself out of the window well. 

My arms felt hot and full of sand after my hours with the sledgehammer. I scrambled for some purchase along the rigid metal walls with my feet, eventually managing to boost myself up enough to slowly begin rising onto the ground above. 

It was dark out, and the forest around me was pitch-black with the exception of the faint light glowing from the windows of the house. I groaned as I pulled myself out of the window well, out onto the ground, but had little time to catch my breath.

“Oh God, oh my God” I could hear his voice, his stunned whisper just a few feet away in the room beneath me. 

He was in the basement now, surely seeing my mother’s corpse uncovered, and the open window mere feet away.

“BRINLEY!” He sounded unhinged, his voice seeming to shake the walls around him.

I pulled myself to my feet and ran. Twigs and crinkling leaves announced the sudden burst of movement as I peeled off towards the treeline; which had for years symbolized the border edge of my entire world.

“Brinley, please! I did it for you, baby! Your mom - she - she was sick! She thought I might hurt you, and she wanted to take you away, but Brin, you know daddy would never hurt you, right?!”

His voice pleaded from behind me, at points wavering with exertion. 

I chanced a glance behind me as I rounded the corner of the house, heading off towards the gravel path that served as our driveway, just in time to see my father pulling himself to his feet where I’d just stood outside of the window well.

Our eyes met briefly, his glistening with tears and an unfamiliar madness.

My heart pounded in my chest, and my lungs burned, the bottoms of my bare feet beginning to sting from the pebbles, twigs, and detritus of the forest. 

“Brinleeyyyy-” he practically shrieked my name, “Brinley I did it for you!”

He was gaining on me. I could tell by the rapid approach of his unhinged screaming. Despite my best efforts, I was half the size of my father, and without my shoes running was growing excruciating. I had to think of something quickly. I veered off, hoping my father wouldn’t emerge in time to see where I was heading, racing off towards the old trailer. It had been all but untouched since the house was built, a rotting memory stood on cinderblocks. 

I quickly crawled beneath, and held my breath, watching the corner I’d rounded. My father emerged seconds later. His eyes were wide and wild, searching frantically through the surrounding brush. His hair was slicked with sweat and clung to his forehead in wet clumps. In his hand, he gripped a blade.

I didn’t want to know what he intended to do with it.

“How did you know?” he moaned into the darkness, his voice wavering as he sobbed the question. 

“Was it those dreams? Huh? Did your *bitch* of a mother fuck me over just one more time from beyond the grave?!”

He spun as he spoke, eyes practically bulging as they scanned the darkness, and face a deep red, jaw clenched and teeth bared as spittle flew. I clasped my hand over my mouth, praying for my very heartbeat and breathing to be silenced.

He shook with emotion; unmitigated rage, and an unhinged sadness. He screamed, loud and raw, kneeling down for a moment with his head between his hands - and my heartbeat practically froze as we stood almost at eye level.

To my luck, he stood, never bothering to look beneath the trailer. 

“Brinley, I know you can hear me out there. I tried my best for you baby, I really did. I tried to make sure you didn’t grow up like…*her*, that you were good and obedient, but I’m sorry baby, I don’t think I can help you,” he muttered, head lowered in his hands.

“No matter what I do, half of you comes from her, and maybe - maybe you always were hers.”

His eyes snapped up, right at the trailer. He rose, his hand working nervously around the hilt of the blade, and rounded the trailer, opening the door.

He thought I was inside.

This was my chance. I carefully slid out from beneath the trailer on the opposite side as I heard the door shut behind him. I was no more than 20 yards from the treeline. If I could disappear into the woods, I could find my way back to the road eventually. 

It was risky, I knew he could potentially see me from the windows of the trailer, but staying put felt far riskier.

Taking a breath, I slid out from beneath the trailer and darted for the trees. I was just passing the first line of old oaks when I heard the door slam behind me and the clamor of movement,.

“Brinley, come here baby girl, I’m not mad, I understand now you were never going to be mine, always hers, always poisoned by her sickness. But that’s okay, Daddy’s gonna help you see mommy again, I promise, it’ll be easy. Just stop running!”

I felt jagged rocks and sharp twigs tear into my feet, but I didn’t slow down, racing through the forest as branches whipped at my face and eyes.

“C’MERE YOU LITTLE BITCH!” he roared the familiar, unhinged anger I used to see during his and my mothers arguments finally taking full control.

Father was bigger, faster, and angrier. But for me? I had been stuck on that property for years since we’d moved, limited only to the surrounding woods for any semblance of adventure. I knew them better than he did. There was a gulch approaching, through which a small stream ran, farther down the way a large cement pipe opened up into it, big enough for me to crawl into.

The sound of breaking branches and earth trampled underfoot grew behind me, my father screaming a wordless, rage-filled scream. 

I let myself slide down the gulch, landing in the little stream below pulling myself onto its banks, and ran until I reached the pipe, crawling inside. The faint trickle of water echoed through the long dark, tunnel, and a wet, damp smell filled the air. I stayed quiet.

Footsteps approached from somewhere outside, and I felt my heart soar into my throat threatening to suffocate me there, as they drew nearer. The sound of water being disturbed as someone trudged through it made me freeze, right as a pair of legs appeared outside of my hiding spot. 

I held my breath, knowing my life likely depended on it.

“BRINLEY, YOU COME BACK HERE DAMN IT!” I jumped but managed to stay quiet.

“Brinley…” he called again, voice lower, raw with emotion.

He stayed out there for what felt like hours, but couldn’t have been more than minutes, moaning my name like some phantom as he roamed the woods in search of me. 

The moment he left the spring, I was gone, darting through the woods regardless of the injuries to my feet, refusing to stop until I reached the nearest active road. I nearly got myself killed throwing myself in front of the beams of the approaching pickup signaling them to stop.

Luckily they managed to stop a mere foot away from me. 

“Well, now what in the fuck are you think-” the driver began, a big, burly sort of guy with a thick red beard. He paused as soon as he got a good look at me. 

I must have looked like a mess. A 12-year-old girl covered in sweat and filthy water, clothes torn from prying branches, feet bleeding, and eyes red and puffy.

I offered the best, brief, explanation that I could. The truth. My father had killed my mother and was now trying to kill me, leaving out the unnecessary details for time and a doubt that it would make me seem anything other than crazy.

I suppose I was lucky I hadn’t stumbled into a worse creep, the man immediately drove me to the local police station, even giving me his jacket to stay warm on the drive after seeing me shiver while we drove. I didn’t bother to mention it wasn’t from the cold.

When we arrived at the station, the cop at the desk's eyes widened upon seeing me, her face going pale at first.

“Holy shit,” she breathed, “Brinley Adams?” 

I nodded, confusion and exhaustion covering my thoughts in a haze.

“You’re alive.” She breathed as if looking at a ghost. She stood from her chair, giving the man a questioning look, causing him to raise his arms in a placating gesture and begin explaining.

“I just found her on the side of the road, almost hit the damn kid. She was a mess.”

The woman rounded her desk, kneeling in front of me.

“Brinley, you’ve been missing for almost two and a half years, ever since the night your father -”

She trailed off, looking somewhat uncomfortable.

“Killed my mom.” I finished, eyes glazing as the words seemed to finally hit home.

She nodded, pressing her lips into a thin line. 

“I know this is going to be hard but one of the other officers is going to take you to a room and ask you some questions okay, I need you to tell us what happened these last few years.”

I did. 

The woman called her colleagues, and before long the precinct was abuzz with news of my return. 

Apparently, my disappearance had become something of a minor phenomenon in the area, old reports of my being seen years prior stirring our ordeal into something of an urban legend. 

The morning after my father had taken me, my mother had reported the kidnapping and was raising hell to get me back. Her efforts were blowing the story up, and my face had apparently been on so many posters, billboards, and newsreels that I was something of a minor celebrity in the area. 

They couldn’t be sure, but when my mother disappeared, they suspected my father had played a role, but with him still MIA, it was impossible to prove and so the case of her murder, and my kidnapping, both fell cold.

Until my miraculous return. By the end of the hour, officers had already been dispatched to my father's house in search of him. They found him. In the basement alongside my mother, having repainted the walls with his brain and the business end of a shotgun.

I spent some time in the foster care system before they eventually found my next of kin, a cousin of my mothers who was willing to take on the responsibility of raising me,

As ridiculous as it seems to survive what I did, I lived a relatively good life - all things considered.

My past would always be marred by the hideous scar of what I’d experienced, and my nightmares were plagued by half-remembered memories of phantom women and the sound of a sledgehammer - but I was alive, and each passing day was another handful of dirt on the coffin of that memory.

Or it had been. I had been content to limit my recollection of the event for the odd therapy session. Never once would I have considered reliving it all in the form of a story but…well, I guess I don’t know what else to do.

I’d almost convinced myself I’d misremembered much of the events. 

Through therapy and self-doubt, I’d been more than willing to rationalize the things I’d seen and heard as some convoluted coping mechanism my mind had devised to lead me to a conclusion I must have somehow known deep down, and provide the closure I needed.

But now, now, I’m not so sure.

It began last night. Last night, as sleep began to pull me into it’s murky depths, I heard something. Something eerily, unshakably familiar, that sent a cold chill down my spine. 

From somewhere outside of my house, amidst the surrounding forest, echoed a sound I recognized, wordless, but unmistakable. It was the rage-filled cry of a man, one I had heard many years before.

My *father*.

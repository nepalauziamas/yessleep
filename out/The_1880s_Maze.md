I stayed at my boyfriend's house for 1 week. David lives alone in his house so sometimes we would go out and have fun in a club or just anywhere. Everything was normal until  Sunday at 10 pm. This day I decided to do something different. I decided to take my car and drive with my boyfriend David at 10 pm. I don't know why but I love this feeling when you drive with music loud at night. Crazy right? 

 Sunday night, the day I asked David to go on a fun car ride around town with me, David was watching TV and sitting on a couch eating popcorn. He was watching "Léon: the professional"

so I asked David
"hey David, I know it's late but do you wanna ride the car with me, I just wanna take a ride around this town. who knows, maybe we will find something interesting."

"do you know what time is it now? it's 10 pm, and everyone is sleeping. I think nothing is so interesting in this town cause I already showed you everything this week. also, I wanna finish the film." he replied and continued eating. I guess he thought that I was joking.

When I opened the door, he stood up and said "are you serious? ... okay, fine, just give me a minute I'll go wear something." 

I expected him to disagree cause normally he doesn't like going out at this late hour.  But at this point, many weird things begin to happen.

Finally, David finished changing his clothes. He usually takes a long time to finish. 
"Wow you look cool as always," I said while raising my eyebrow and winking.

Then suddenly I hear David's bed make a squeaky noise as if someone is sitting on the bed and we are only two people here in the living room. I mean what the hell is going on here? 

"David, did you hear that? what's going on with your bed?  " I asked him after hearing the bed

"oh don't worry, it's cause the bed is old, it usually makes this noise," he replied then he closed the TV and put the popcorn in the kitchen then came out with me to the car.

But David looks not normal. His skin looks pale.

"Are you okay? do you wanna go back home?" I asked him

"No it's fine don't worry, I felt bored anyway."

I drove the car with David for some time but this time we saw the unexpected. we saw a gigantic MAZE.

While I was driving, I saw a sign written on it (MAZE)
I can also see a date written (1880) I think it's a very old gigantic maze designed at that time. I asked David if he saw this maze before and he said "No."

We both exited the car then I took out my phone and took a selfie of me, David, behind the maze. That will be a great memory.

"Do you wanna enter?" I asked him cause I never entered a maze before and It would be so fun entering at night. I'm not scared of it. But entering a gigantic maze for the first time at night with my boyfriend would be a great memory. 

"Yes," he responded. But I was shocked by this response. Because I didn't expect him to agree that easily. His response scared me.

he said "yes" while focusing his eye gaze on me and he gave a smirk that creeped me out even more.

"David, why did you give me that smirk? That's creepy." He gave me no response.

The first step I took inside the maze, my pulse was beating in my ears, my muscles were tense, my mouth felt suddenly dry, and goose bumps sprang up all over my arms.
I have a feeling that something is not right but unfortunately I decided to ignore those feelings.

My boyfriend wasn't afraid at all but he didn't say a word after that weird smirk he gave me. but he is still holding my hand.

we both walked with my phone flashlight. my phone battery is 30% which is not a good sign.  However, David was still holding my hand and his hand was so cold.

"David, I think it's a bad idea to keep walking like that, we will get lost," I said, and I was worried and so cold.

"It was your idea so let's finish what you started," he said that then suddenly he left my hand and walked forward then to the left. Then shouted and said, "Come after me!!"

So I followed David with my phone flashlight. I walked forward and then to the left. But David was not there.
I shouted "David, where are you?!!" but there was no response. My heart beat faster and faster and I was afraid. I didn't know what to do.  So I stood there in my place and I called David. I couldn't hear his phone ringing. The maze was so quiet. I can only hear my heart beats. So I texted him, but I still got no response.

Now weird things happened. I decided to try to exit the maze but I think I'm lost. I entered to the left, straight, left but still no exit. I called David many times but he didn't answer his phone. I shouted his name but no response.

David's disappearance is making me worried. 
My phone battery is 28% and I have to find him.
we've been 3 hours. It's 1 am

I can hear footsteps behind me so I turn around and it's not David. It's a man wearing a fancy high-top hat, a fashionable frock coat, and black leather shoes. he looked young and handsome. he pointed his black cane toward me and  said " what brings you here young lady?"

"I just wanted to have fun with my boyfriend but he acted weird." The whole situation seems weird because this man doesn't look normal. His clothes are not normal.

"Are you sure that he is your boyfriend?"  he said.

"what do you mean?" I responded

"You must get out of here, follow me and I'll show you the way."

"what about my boyfriend?"

"He is not your boyfriend, nothing here is real except you. This maze has 10 exits, each exit is different and is not real. There is only one real exit, which is the exit you came from. You're not supposed to be here. Your boyfriend is in danger." The man kept talking to me while I was following him. His voice is so deep and very relaxing. 

"what do you mean that my boyfriend is in danger? what's going to happen to him?"

"First, you must get out and go back home. Something evil is after your boyfriend. Take this paper. I drew something on it for him. I need you to draw the same drawing on your boyfriend's bedroom door before 2 am. if it's 2 am then it's too late to save your boyfriend." 
He said those words while holding my hand. I can see the worry in his eyes. 

Finally, I exit the Maze. The man waved goodbye and he enter the maze. 

I found my car keys inside my pockets. I drove back home. I arrived 1:40

I enter David's house. I found his bedroom door open. 
But who the heck is that? someone is sleeping there in bed. 

I was distracted, confused, out of breath, shaking, and sweating all at once. I felt numb. I had many unanswered questions. I felt safe around the stranger with a fancy hat that I met in the maze. I should do what he says to save my boyfriend because I sense bad energy from all of this situation. 

I closed the bedroom door and I searched for a marker and luckily I found one in the kitchen. 

The kitchen door slammed and I could hear it lock too. I tried to open it but it doesn't open. 
it's 1:45 I have only 5 min left. 
I took my hair clip and I opened the door.

I ran to the bedroom door and finally I drew the drawing on the bedroom door while I was shaking very badly, having a panic attack, and my breath was short and shallow.

I slowly opened the door and turned on the lights to check out who that person was. It was my boyfriend. 

He was sleeping in bed, pale, with very dried lips. he breathes so fast and his heart beats so fast. I woke him up and he was very shocked and shaking.
He hugged me and I hugged him and we both cried.


We both slept together while hugging each other and we didn't say any words.

The next day.  I wanted an explanation. I wanted answers.

Everything seemed like a dream to me, until I asked David this question.

"did you eat popcorn yesterday before we went out?" I asked him this just to make sure if this is not my imagination.

"No," he replied

"you ate popcorn and watched léon the professional then I told you if you wanna drive around town and you agreed.

"I don't know what are you talking about, I didn't watch this movie yesterday and I didn't go anywhere with you. I slept at 10 pm yesterday. Also, I would never go out this late. I think it was just you dreaming"

To prove to him that I'm not wrong. I went to the kitchen and I found the popcorn plate and I showed him.

"what about this popcorn?" 

"Well, I don't remember," he said

Then I took his hand to show him the stuff I drew on his bedroom door. but he still didn't believe me.

"Why did you cry yesterday when you woke up?" I asked him curiously 

" I had a nightmare. I think I was lost in the woods then a witch ran after me to kill me so I kept running and I thought I was gonna die but you and a man saved me. you held my right hand then together we went out of the woods. After the man killed that witch I guess both the man and the witch disappeared then I woke up."  David answered me but he was still until this point convinced that everything was just a dream.

" The man you mentioned wore a high-top hat and a fashionable frock coat. Right?" I replied without hesitation.

"what? how did you know?" he said

"Well, you still won't believe me if I tell you that I met this man in person inside a gigantic maze and you were there with me."

David gave me a (what the heck do you mean look)

Finally to prove to David that it's all real. I open the gallery and I show him the picture we both took in Infront of the maze entrance. 

David was speechless. Both of us are still confused.
We went to check out the maze again together but we never saw this maze again. 

The maze disappeared into thin air.

After 1 week passed, I received a call from my boyfriend saying that he found a voodoo doll under the floor in the basement of his home.

He went to a priest and showed him the voodoo doll. The priest mentioned that it's a bad sign and it's a witch's work. Some kind of dark magic. 

The priest went into my boyfriend's basement to take a look. 
He found MORE stuff.

A dead rat, some other terrible stuff that is a work of witchcraft. 

Why would anyone do this? 

David decided to leave this town as soon as possible. 

And the priest continued to solve this mystery. We hope we find an answer.

But I have a weird sensation that it's not the home that's cursed. I have a strong feeling that this is made for David.  Cause his home belongs to his grandparents. 

I'm just too scared to contact the priest to find out what else is hidden there.

[The real questions here are]

 who is that man wearing a high-top hat with a frock coat who saved David? What is this maze? Why do they want to kill David? 

The only common thing we saw, me and David, was that man.

So If I didn't listen to the man, do you think David would have been dead?

I have many unanswered questions and I'm afraid to go back to this town again.

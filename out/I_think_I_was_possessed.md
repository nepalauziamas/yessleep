(As a side note, I've just started shaking writing this and shook all the way through)

It's been 3 years since this happened, but it sticks like glue to me; I always wondered what happened that afternoon. I sometimes think I'm mad believing that this happened, but my best friend at the time saw it all and experienced it as well; even he can't explain it.

Back in 2019 I was your typical 'bake up' kind of kid; I'd go over to my friends house, light up and snack on munchies, listen to some music and piss around for the night.

**The lead up**

One night; I was with my best friend and we did the typical thing; put on some music and start baking.

Give it around 15 minutes after we begin smoking, I need to go to the bathroom because I start to feel sick. I get the the bathroom and instantly collapse over the toilet seat; I do not vomit, but my mind goes aloof. Keep in mind, we were just smoking weed, **no DMT whatsoever.**

**The trip**

My eyes close and I feel this sudden rush, something similar but not quite the same as what is shown in the simulation videos. My body was paralysed and I started going through a tunnel. Everything became really intense and I met a female deity, friendly but strict. The noise was just 'om' humming constantly in the background with different intensities and sometimes chanting.

To this day, I am too scared to tell anyone what she showed me, including my best friend; **she told me I was not allowed to describe what she showed me to anyone**.

The long and short of it is, she took me to the starting point of the universe and took me through the past, present and future of the world and me; she also gave me a ton of personal insights on life and made me realise how small I was in comparison to God.

Mid way through this, my friend is knocking on the bathroom door and I physically cannot move, the deity will not let me go until she has told me everything.

This lasted for around 30 minutes until I was then finally able to leave the bathroom. I went back into my friends room and I told him, 'some freaky shit just happened', I start giving him an insight into what happened and the deity tells me 'he's not ready', I tell me friend that 'she's told me you're not ready', and he starts laughing.

**This is where it gets really weird.**

I remember this part very vaguely, but apparently my eyes glazed over all of a sudden, dotting all over the room; my vision was completely focused on him from my perspective; something took over my body and completely ripped into my friend and his beliefs on spirituality and life, using me as its carrier; I lost complete control of what I was saying; the thing that took control of me was revealing and challenging my friends life about stuff I don't even know about; essentially telling my friend off through my body.

The entity spoke with him, through me, for around 5 minutes, ending it with 'you are not ready' and 'you need to grow up', all of a sudden, the table shook a little, the curtains blew round the window and we were both sober. **I mean, instantly... sober.**

**No afterglow, no 'post-bake', nothing.** Both of us, entirely sober.

I often wonder what happened that day.

I completely discarded religion and spirituality from a young age, but whenever I've gone to meet sages or 'spiritualists' with my mum, they're usually more interested in me, being called an 'old soul' by almost all of them, a 'light worker' and an 'arctuarian' by a number. I used to be able to read 'aura' and connect with spirits, however, it used to scare me and I went through a spiritual healing session where I turned off the ability to do those things; it is since then that I lost all interest in spirituality. The sage that helped me do it assured me that although I didn't want it at that time; it's my natural calling.

I hardly know what any of this means, still, however, this might have something to do with what happened that day?

It still freaks the hell out of me, and I sometimes think I am imagining things. I know I am not however; my friend saw it and experienced it too; a deep rationalist and atheist once upon a time, he says that day seeing me being 'possessed', as he describes it, has changed him forever; he doesn't believe, and neither do I believe, that I was acting... that was an act of possession.

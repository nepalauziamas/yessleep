It was back in 2021. I was sharing an apartment with a family in Canberra. My room was close to balcony from where I could see few houses, apartments and shopping centre. I had a window facing the balcony. Canberra is typically a cold place in Australia and it can get as cold as in the mountains in Nepal. I know because I originally come from Nepal. 

It was winter in 2021, and I was snuggling with my stuffed Woolen llama inside my comforter. My bed was placed against the window where I could reach the curtains just lying in my bed and didn’t have to wake up. I am a light sleeper so any faint sound is enough to wake me up. So I was in a deep sleep when I woke up to the sound of light tapping on the window.   There was a hammock in the balcony just near to the window which would touch it and make tapping sound with any gentle wind. I assumed it to be the hammock and tried falling back asleep. I heard distinct tapping again like it was someone knocking on the window. I opened my eyes and held my breath to figure out the sound. When I didn’t hear anything I tried sleeping again. 

After I was almost asleep I heard the similar tapping and this time I looked from the corner of the curtain to see what was out there. The balcony light was off but had bit of rays coming from the street lights enlightening some parts of the balcony. I could see the silhouette of hammock, the drying rack and the two chairs. I rubbed my eyes to get a clear view but that was all I could see. So I put my head back on the pillow thinking about how quiet Canberra actually is. Because at this time, Sydney would still have people walking all over the street just as much in the day time. I thought of this but had no idea what time it was, I pulled up my phone to see the time. It was 01:06 as shown in the dim screen of my phone.

I was annoyed because it was midnight and I woke up because of nothing. It always happens since I’m a light sleeper and I wake up anytime to absolutely nothing. I closed my eyes trying to sleep. Then I heard my name.

 “P!” I opened my eyes but this time I wasn’t asleep. I really heard it and it sounded like the lady from the family in the next room. “P, are you awake?” She asked in an almost whispering voice. I was thinking is it really her or am I hearing voices. “P, come outside, wake up wake up! Come faster “ her voice was neither alarming nor whispering. Just normal call , like a day to day voice. I pulled the curtains from the corner and peeked outside, I could tell it was chilly outside just by looking at those swaying trees and the moving canopy of our hammock. But didn’t see anyone. I sat up in my bed. “Are you hearing my voice? P, come outside, wake up, quick!” I heard the same voice in the same tone. I was sure she was awake and was calling me outside. I didn’t want to leave my bed with my comfy llama and warm comforter. So I pretended not to hear her! I went back to sleep.

“P” I heard the voice almost immediately along with another tapping on my window. I was annoyed but didn’t want to offend her since she’s a nice lady. So I pretended not to hear anything and forced myself to sleep. 

The next morning everyone was already awake and I woke up to their daughter shouting at my door ,”Aunty wake up, we have pancakes today “ They were nice people and would share their food with me especially because I lived by myself. Except for her dad, because he was a creep when he was alone with me. 

Generally they were nice. I adored her , she was 8 yo and was always around me.  So I smiled and said ok. She opened the door and jumped into my bed. She liked to cuddle with me and we stayed there for 15 minutes before waking up. I brushed my teeth and started making coffee for everyone. The lady was making pancakes and she asked me if I have work today. I said yeah and then I thought of asking her about last night. I told her what I heard and that I thought it was a dream and that’s why I didn’t go outside. I knew someone was calling me outside but I told her it could be a dream because I didn’t want her to think I actually heard her and don’t go. 

She looked surprised and said “I didn’t call you! Why would I?” I didn’t say anything just stared back. Then she proceeded to say “you must have been dreaming”. I smiled and said “maybe” and laughed along with her. But I know it wasn’t a dream since I’m a light sleeper and I remember exactly every detail of the that night.
I’m still terrified and shook to the core of my heart and still think to this day what would have happened if I actually went outside, or to the thought what if it was summer and I had wanted to go outside to feel the breeze!

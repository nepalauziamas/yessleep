When people are scared of the dark, they're not scared *because* it's dark, they're scared because they're afraid of what lies in it. As humans, we're most often afraid of the unknown, because we don't know what will happen, and we don't know what it is.

I've been working in the secret service as what they like to call a 'paranormal officer' for a couple of years now, and for the longest time, we've been detecting strange anomalies coming from across the state our bunker is in, but also across the whole country. The general public doesn't know about us, so it helps us get through our tasks and goals quicker. My boss and our chief Baron runs our commission.

I work in a tight team of people that includes me and my buddies Alex, Trevor, and Hailie. Just so everyone reading can get to know me more, my name is Mason. Unfortunately, we've been running low on officers recently, so we're some of the only people ever on duty. Though for being a project put together by the secret service, it was surprisingly cheap.

After a year of closely scanning the perimeter for any signs of something supernatural, we've picked multiple things up, and found 6 dangerous beings that were determined that must be captured- or killed, immediately.

I arrived today at the secret bunker after being called in by Baron for an "emergency meeting." I came in fast as I could, knowing it was important. (For privacy reasons, I won't say where the bunker is located)

Despite being hired as a paranormal officer and getting paid good money, I never needed to be on duty that much, considering we've never seen anything out of the ordinary, aside those 'anomalies' being false alarms, making everyone on the team feel kind of useless to society.

I drove through some treelines slowly and parked along some rocks, away from the street. I get out of my car, putting my phone in my pocket, and start jogging to the bunker. It was quite far away but I was able to step through some bushes and feel around the grass and dirt for a moment before opening up the trap door and climbing onto the concrete steps below. All of the lights were already on, reflecting a faded blue light. I quietly close the trap door above me.

I walk down the steps and see Alex, Trevor, Hailie, and Baron standing around a table with a map in the middle of it. I see everyone look up at me upon my arrival.

"About time you showed up, Mason. You're late," Baron says up to me.

"Yeah, sorry, I parked far away from here so that's my bad," I respond, gritting my teeth.

"We're going to be important for once, so shut up and get down here already," Alex says up to me, his long, curly hair getting in his face.

I make it down and look around the room. The equipment room door was wide open, and the surveillance room door was closed. I looked behind where Baron was standing and saw every computer on, zoomed in on a signal. I've never been in a meeting here and I never saw the computers on a screen like that, so I knew something was happening.

Baron eyes all of us and starts to speak in a serious tone. "Last night, we picked multiple anomalies up around this side of the country. The west side. 6 dangerous beings are walking loose on this country. So far, we've only classified 2 of them, and we need to get moving. Fast."

"Well, what are they?" Hailie says. Baron takes a deep breath.

"One of them I'm still trying to figure out how to deal with, but the other should be relatively easy." Baron points down at the map on the table. I take a look. A spot in Washington was neatly circled in red marker. "We've detected something strange inside of an abandoned cabin in northern Washington."

"What is it?" Trevor asks.

"I'm not sure. Just don't turn any of the lights off," Baron says. I shivered. What did that mean?

Baron continued. "You guys are lucky that the cabin is not that far away. Only about an hour away from here. You'll get there soon,"

"But what will we need to have on us?" Hailie asks nervously. Baron nods and walks into the equipment room. We wait another minute before he walks back out with an array of items in his arms. He lays everything out in front of us.

"You'll all need a pistol," Baron starts handing us a pistol one by one. "A flashlight, a radio, and a taser." He hands us everything else one by one. "For the radio, please call in for when you kill it or capture it. If you capture it, I'll give you directions to a secret testing lab that we put together around the border of Washington and Oregon. If you kill it, then I'll give further instructions, depending on what it is."

"Jesus, this sounds complicated..." Trevor mutters. Baron bats an eye at him.

"You signed up for this, didn't you?" Baron smirks as Trevor nods in response. "Alright, you all need to get moving. Now,"

"But how do we know we can take this thing down? I mean, this is our first time actually hunting for a creature," I say, starting to go for the stairs.

"As I said, when you get to the cabin, make every light is on so it can't blindside you. Now move!"

&#x200B;

We got the coordinates to the cabin as we loaded into an undercover car that Baron had provided for us around the back of some trees, hidden from sight. The whole drive was us trying to think of a plan, and speculating on what this thing was. We were also provided a metal vest so our body didn't get too beat up, along with knee and elbow pads.

Along the way, Alex had said he felt like we might not make it out of this alive, which had sparked a discussion between us, trying to figure out why we signed up to hunt for supernatural beings to protect the country and if it was worth potentially traumatizing ourselves.

I was the one driving and when we were almost to the location, Hailie, who was in the passenger seat, noticed that I was looking more pale than usual. She put a hand on my shoulder.

"It's gonna be okay, Mason," She says lightly. I look back at her and smile. We've been friends for 6 years and we could almost always tell when something was wrong with each other.

I sigh. "Hopefully. I remember we signed up because we didn't think it was that serious, but now it is, and we're gonna run into some monster, I-"

"I know you're scared. We all are," Hailie lightly says again as Alex and Trevor started to argue behind us about who was going to kill the creature. I look back on the road. I feel Hailie's hand release from my shoulder.

"I also just care too much about you guys to potentially lose you to these threats, you know?" I say as we start driving up a hill. The sun was beginning to go down, and the sky was almost completely blocked by how tall the trees were.

Hailie leans back in her seat and looks out the window. "I am too..." I look at her and see her hand pressed against the gun in her belt.

I drive up to the end of the hill and finally get back on flat land, and in the distance, I see a run-down cabin. I checked the location on my phone. That was the place we needed to be.

"Is that where we need to go?" I hear Trevor pressed against my seat.

"Shit, um yeah," I stutter a little bit. I hear Alex laugh a bit as I continue driving towards it.

"What's wrong Mason? You gonna back out?" Trevor teases me. I shake my head and look back at him.

"I know you're scared too, man. Just shut the hell up," I try to snicker at him, but I was too worried to do it. I hear Trevor mumble something under his breath as he looks at me, laughing.

We drive closer to the cabin, and it looked really nasty, like someone had been dumping their trash on it for years, and no one bothered to pick it up. When we pulled up to it, I felt this strong urge to get out of there coming from my gut, and I started getting fearful that we were now here. I hear Alex quickly get out of the car, and Trevor did the same. I lean back in my seat.

Hailie nudges me on the shoulder. I look at her. "Come on, stop being so slow," Hailie smiles at me as she opens her door and gets out. I couldn't help but smile back a little bit.

I had always sometimes wanted to be more than just friends with Hailie. She was nice and funny, the perfect package. But I always lost those feelings out of fear that she didn't feel the same. I got out of the car and caught up to everyone else at the front of the cabin.

I looked up at it and examined it. It looked- and overall just felt eerie. I looked at Alex, and he looked scared as well.

"Shit..." I hear him say. Now that we were all here, I think we all realized just how frightened we actually were. We had to be brave though, as we needed to clear these creatures from the face of the earth.

I remember the training I had on my first day, and I pulled my gun out and watched as everyone else did the same.

"Fuck, I don't want to do this now," Trevor says. I pat him on the back.

"We're all together, we'll be fine. You can do this Trevor," Hailie says back to him. Trevor looks at me and gives me a confused look.

"How can she be so confident and fearless when we're literally going to go in and try to capture a monster?" Trevor whispers to me. I shrug.

"That's Hailie, for you," I whisper back as I walk past him and go up the steps of the cabin. Hailie opens the door and swings it open. We notice immediately that the lights in front of the door are turned off. We remember what Baron said about the lights as we all rush in.

Alex finds the light switch instantly by the front door and turns it on, letting light reflect onto us. We breathe a sigh of relief as we close the front door. We could've immediately been attacked by whatever creature is supposedly in here before we even stepped foot in the cabin.

The cabin was cold and chilly, with an immensely ominous feeling lingering across it. I shivered from the cold, but also from the fear that I was currently unable to express. We started slowly moving forward in the cabin, searching the various rooms inside. We checked the kitchen. The lights were on.

We checked the small living room. The lights were on.

We checked the bathroom. The lights were on.

There wasn't an upstairs, so we felt that whatever the creature is was closer to us than we thought. We stayed in a group as we took another walk around the cabin.

"Where the fuck is it?" Alex whispers, annoyed.

"I don't know, but I feel it somewhere," Hailie whispers back. I keep surveying for rooms with the lights off, but no such luck.

I started feeling like we walked past another room, or at the very least a door without realizing it. I stop my movement and think as the others continue going throughout the cabin without me. I turn back and start walking down the hall again, paying attention to the walls. Before I knew it, in the middle of the hall, there was a door that lead to some kind of closet that we had missed. Shit.

I felt my heart sink and started fearing for the worst. I looked back for my friends, but then I realized that they were out of sight now.

"Guys?" I shout. At first, there was no response, but after a few seconds, I heard Trevor yell back from across the cabin, telling me to hold on.

I looked back at the door, my hand trembling as I put my hand on the doorknob. I had to check. I needed to make sure that the lights were still on in the closet. I slowly opened the door, praying that the lights weren't off. As the door was fully opened, I saw the lights in the dark closet were off.

I was immediately frightened, and I instinctively raised my gun up. I didn't see anything yet. Nothing was in sight. I looked back down the hall for my friends, but they still weren't back, which made me even *more* frightened.

I looked back into the void that was the closet as I took a slow, steady step in. As I got myself into the closet, searching and feeling around for a light switch, I felt a wave of air hit me in the face. It felt kinda weird and unnatural, almost warm, which was unconventional. It also smelt nasty...

That was when I realized that something was *breathing on me.*

I immediately fell numb. I couldn't put any thoughts into my head, unable to tell myself what to do. I was just as still as a statue, waiting for my demise.

I moved my eyes up slightly above me and saw demonic grey eyes, looming and standing tall over me.

My mouth opened to scream but in an instant, a large hand covered my eyes and my mouth and gripped my head, making me unable to make any noise and completely taking my vision away. I was about to *die,* I told myself. I tried squirming away, but whatever this was had such a strong grip on me that I couldn't even move. I felt nothing but fear coming from me, and ghostliness coming from this creature.

I then heard a gunshot from behind me, and I felt the hand come off my eyes and mouth and hissing soon after. I looked back and saw Trevor in front of the door with his gun pointed into the closet. He motioned for me to get out.

I quickly ran out, seeing everyone else behind Trevor, and looked back into the closet. I saw the eyes again, looking directly at us. It looked unnaturally tall, and the eyes were... *Threatening.*

"The fuck is that thing?" Trevor says. I heard some shakiness in his words. He was scared too. I could hear it in his voice. I quickly pulled my flashlight out from my belt and shined it on whatever was in there but right as the light went on it, it disappeared.

"What the?-" I say, continuing to move my flashlight around in the closet. There was no sign of any creature in there now.

"Shit, I think it's completely unseen in the light," I hear Hailie say. "That's why Baron said to keep all of the lights on, because then it can't do anything to us,"

"Okay, let's turn that flashlight off, go in there, and then kill it," Alex says, looking at me. I shake my head, mouthing "Hell no," to Trevor.

Hailie starts saying something again. "Alex, are you crazy-"

***Click.***

The hall light turned off. We were standing in darkness now.

Before we could react, we felt something briskly run past us, leaving a slight breeze behind. We quickly turn to where it ran, and I turn my flashlight down the hall. We didn't see the creature.

The living room light then flickered off.

We quickly ran into the kitchen where there was still light. Alex stayed behind to turn the hall light back on. We grouped up in the small kitchen and surveyed the darkness in the living room.

"I want to quit this so bad," I say, breathing heavily. Everyone else nods in agreement.

"No way I can do this again with 5 other creatures, fuck that," Trevor says, turning his flashlight on and pointing it all the way into the living room. "Should've thought about what we'd be in for before signing up to be paranormal officers-"

***Click.***

We heard the hall light turn off yet again.

"Damn it, are you serious?" Alex angrily says. He takes out his flashlight and grumbles. "I'm gonna go turn the light back on in the hall. Trevor, you go turn the living room lights back on. We need time to figure out how we're going to take this thing out. Hailie, Mason, you guys stay here." Alex starts moving toward the hall, and Trevor hesitates before moving towards the living room.

Me and Hailie awkwardly but nervously stand around in the kitchen, waiting for Alex and Trevor. We didn't even know what this creature was, and what it could do to us if we screwed up. I started getting a feeling that something was going to happen quickly.

"It's going to reappear. I can feel it..." I say to Hailie. "I don't feel safe here anymore, even though I have a gun and some cheap taser,"

Hailie smiles at me. I get confused at first. What would she be smiling at?

"You're cute when you're scared," Hailie says to me. I look back at her.

"What?" I was surprised at her response. Did she really just say that? No, she couldn't have. I continue questioning this as she gets closer to me.

"You heard me, didn't you? I said you're cute when you're scared," She slowly puts a hand on my face as I start to get red. Was this really happening? No, it most certainly w*as* happening. My friend of 6 years that I started having a crush on was doing this. I almost forgot about the creature-

***BANG, BANG.***

Loud bangs were coming from the closet door. My attention goes from Hailie and snaps to the sounds coming from the closet.

"Mason, don't worry about that. Let it just be us before Alex and Trevor come back..." Hailie breathes. I smile as the fear left me for a second. I let my heart beat fast and take over, as I let Hailie get her face closer to mine.

"GET ME OUT OF HERE!" A voice rings out from inside the closet. A voice that... Sounded like Hailie.

I looked back at Hailie(?) who was in front of me. If I heard Hailie from the closet, but she was in front of me, then that means...

The lights in the kitchen promptly turn off.

I immediately snap back to fear as I saw the grey eyes that I saw in the closet return in front of me, right where 'Hailie' was standing.

I realize what happened as the creature grabs my head, holding me still as I feel its eyes pressed against mine. It looked deep into my soul as it throws me face first down to the floor. I hear it stomp out of the kitchen as I feel my nose starting to bleed, and I start getting dizzy from the impact.

I hear Alex scream, and I start to hear a lot of commotion coming from the hall, the light flicking on and off before I hear it finally click off, and a loud gunshot that echoed throughout the cabin, nearly piercing my eardrums.

I raise my head up and try to look into the hall and see Alex's gun soon get thrown into the kitchen. I look into the hall and see the creature now holding Alex up by the neck. The creature was still so extraordinarily tall, and its body was so dark that I couldn't even tell what it looked like. I just saw its eyes and its long arms.

I hear the closet door eventually swing open, and hear Hailie scream as she does so, as the creature looks back and stares at her. The creature slams Alex against the wall, letting him drop to the floor. Alex starts coughing aggressively as he holds onto the wall.

I quickly get up and hold my head as I move into the hall, still holding onto my gun, unprepared for what the creature would do but dead set on getting this mission done and killing it.

I turn and go into the hall and see Hailie sitting against the wall, looking up at the creature. I see her eyes move onto me.

"MASON, HELP!" She yells at me. I don't hesitate as I raise my gun up and pull the trigger, watching the bullet go into the creature's back, ripping into its fabricated skin, watching its flesh fly everywhere.

I hear it roar as it turns back to face me. I put my gun back in my belt and pull out my taser after seeing that the gunshot didn't kill it, which scared me to death. I stare at the creature in the eyes, staring into the void that was its grey yet bloodshot eyes, trying to show it that I wasn't scared of it, but deep down, I wanted to get the fuck out of there.

I started to move forward to tase it, but before I could do it, the lights in the hall turned on and the creature disappeared.

I looked behind me to see if Alex had turned the light off but he was still on the ground, away from the light switch and holding onto his neck. I turned to Hailie to see if she did but she was still curled up against the wall, looking up at me. I saw her mouth quivering, yet she didn't say anything.

"Hailie..." I say, trying to figure out how to tell her how the creature must've impersonated her, desperately searching for my words but before they could come to me, the lights in the hall turned off again, and I felt the hands of the creature on my head again, gripping tightly.

I tried to fight against it, with the realization that I was going to die came quickly back to me, making me more terrified than ever. The creature held onto my head tighter and tighter, and I figured out that it was trying to squish my head and pop it.

I turned my taser on, and to the quickest of my ability, I swung it up at the creature and started tasing it in the neck.

Its hands release from my head immediately and I turn to see the electroshocks going into the creature's neck. It went down to its knees as it started shaking uncontrollably, and I realized that I was using all of the taser's power and energy against it.

I closed my eyes and winced as I pressed harder against the taser trigger, wanting the creature to suffer and just die right there. After this, I was done being a paranormal officer. I opened my eyes and saw that I was no longer tasing the creature, but instead Trevor.

I immediately drop the taser and watch as Trevor falls back against the floor, unconscious. I start breathing heavily. Did I just tase Trevor without knowing it? I start thinking back to the situation with Hailie in the kitchen, and that turned out to be the creature impersonating her, so if that was the case, was he impersonating Trevor to make me stop?

"What the fuck is going on back there?" I hear Trevor's voice from behind me. I look back and see Trevor at the end of the hall, looking at me, his gun still in hand.

Shit.

I turn my head back and see the creature rising back up from the floor fast, looking right at me. I had just fallen for another one of its tricks, and I was going to pay for it.

"TREVOR, SHOOT IT!" I scream back at Trevor, moving against the wall. The creature was still looking at me as it was fully back on its feet.

I watched as it suddenly lunged at me before I heard a gunshot coming from Trevor, a bullet going through and piercing the creature's face, knocking it to the side as it was soon laid out on the floor, limp. Smoke began rising from the creature's face after the shot, and there were no signs of it being conscious.

Trevor ran across the hall and turned on the light, and this time, the creature didn't disappear upon being exposed to the light. It was dead.

"Did we kill it?" Trevor says as Alex and Hailie slowly get up. I nod my head and look down at the creature, getting a better look at it. It was unnaturally tall and lanky, and even in the light, it was still so wickedly dark, almost like we were looking through a void. I kicked it a little bit, and it still looked and felt limp.

"Yeah, I think it's dead."

&#x200B;

We called Baron on the radio and told him that we had killed the creature. He told us to leave it there and he'd get some other people in the secret service to go into the cabin and check it out. It was another hour's drive back to the bunker, and the whole time it was silent. We were all just shocked at the event and how much we suffered through it. Along the way, I decided not to tell Hailie about the whole kitchen thing.

We made it back to the bunker exhausted, and we all made an agreement that when we saw Baron that we would quit. No more of this shit. Admittingly, we should've known when we signed up that we'd be in situations like that but to have to hunt 5 more creatures plausibly like that? Hell no.

We stepped down into the bunker, taking our vests off, and walked down towards Baron, who was awaiting our arrival. He was already ready for business.

"Alright, one down, 5 more to go. Good job, guys," Baron says to us. I look at Alex, who looks back at Baron.

"Sorry, but... We want to quit." Alex says.

"What?" Baron says, looking at him.

"Baron, I understand why we need people to do this, these creatures were dangerous but we almost *died* in that cabin. We're done," I tell him. Baron looks at me and gives me an apologetic look.

"I'm sorry guys, but... You can't quit this job now," He says.

"Of course we can, what are you talking about?" Hailie remarks. Baron shakes his head.

"You guys already started the mission of hunting down these creatures. You guys are being held under the secret service. They won't let you quit now," Baron says with sympathy in his voice. He walks back to the table and motions for us to gather around. I sigh as we walk towards it.

"I can't believe this..." Trevor whispers. The same exact thought was going through my head. Secret Service wasn't letting us quit? We had to put ourselves in danger against our will now? I felt like my life was at the beginning of the end, as I felt I was going down a rabbit hole that I didn't want to be in.

"So, who's the next creature, I guess.." Hailie sighs, almost depressingly. Baron thinks for a moment before speaking.

"This next creature that we finally classified, its... Odd," Baron scratches his face for a second. He almost looked scared. Scared for *us.*

He continues. "Not too long ago, there were many reports that something was going into people's yards, hypnotizing them into calling 911, and would later kill them brutally. It mutilated a whole man,"

"Jesus Christ..." I say. This creature already seemed worst than the one we encountered at the cabin.

"Yeah, I know. One of its victims that night was police officer Dawson Evans and his wife Michelle. It went into their home and they saw it in their yards, as it soon went inside their home and ripped their heads clean off their shoulders. Dawson's partner Christian was called onto the scene, and he saw the creature earlier that night in someone else's yard, and he described it as an abomination,"

Trevor has a horrified look on his face. "We still have time to quit, right?" To which Baron responds by simply shaking his head again.

"Again, I'm sorry, but secret service is holding you to this task. You can't quit. You have to be very careful with this one though because this creature is supernaturally fast in its movements. It also has the strength to lift a woman and impale her through her fence. Christian, who I mentioned earlier, has experience with this thing, so I might call him and see if he wants to help you guys out," Baron pulls out his phone.

I give out a long sigh and rub my face. I look back at Baron, who was now dialing a number. I don't know what else to say, other than; "When do we go?"

Baron looks up from his phone at me. "Right now."

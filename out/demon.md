I've only told my close friends about this but I dont think they believe me. so im hoping random strangers on the internet will. this happened just about a month ago but it still spooks me.

I was home alone and I was thrilled because I never was. You'll see why in a bit. It was around 6:15 p.m and I had just gotten out of the shower. I was sitting on the rim of the bathtub, responding to some messages with music playing on my speaker. when all of a sudden i hear someone running. running past the bathroom. they were light footsteps. like a childs. i turned down my music and listened for anything. nothing. I brushed it off and concluded it was just the music. a few minutes later pass and I heard the same thing. but this time i could visualize this "child" running through my house. 

a small, maybe 3-4 year old, blonde kid with a bowl cut. he was skinny and had a navy blue shirt on with 2 lighter blue strips near the collar. khaki colored shorts. he had an old looking bunny stuffed animal. 

I never opened the door. but i just knew this is what was causing the noise. i was frightened. I had been seeing and hearing things since i was 10 or so but this time it was different. it felt real. like i was in real danger. 

I didnt leave the bathroom till almost 7. 

around 6:45 I decided to bolt to my room. it was about 8 feet away from the bathroom. i scanned the room where i heard the noise and saw nothing. maybe i just heard wrong. i got dressed, but still felt uneasy and unsafe but i tried not to pay attention to it. i opened the door to hang up my towel and left it open. i started doing my hair, standing in front of a mirror. I saw this thing. it looked like it was human once before but not anymore. it had the darkest black colored skin I've ever seen. its skin looked like leather. it was boney, had long pointy fingers. like claws. these long black horns and its deep yellow eyes. i could tell it was staring at me from the reflection of the mirror.

It was gone about 2 minutes after I was aware of its presence. I nearly cried. that same night, I went outside so I wouldn't be alone. my aunt joined me. we went on a walk and I told her about what had happened. she told my mom the next day and I was unaware of this. i told her and my dad about this experience and now they're paranoid that something will happen to me if im left alone again. 

I had to be cleansed with sage for a week before bed, put down salt in every corner of my room, and at the entrance of my room. my whole house was saged as well. a month later, I havent experienced anything like that since.

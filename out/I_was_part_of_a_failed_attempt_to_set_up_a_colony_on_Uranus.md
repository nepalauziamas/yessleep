I will probably get in trouble for sharing this story but I don't care as I think people need to know the truth. 

I have no idea why I was chosen as part of the mission as I have very few discernable skills. I was overjoyed at being picked though as I knew it was a once in a lifetime experience.

It took months of training to prepare for what awaited us on the colony. They had already set up a small settlement and just needed the colonists. I remember looking back at Earth and thinking that I may never return. 

We arrived on the 1 April and I tried to think of something iconic to say when I first set foot on the planet. Unfortunately I managed to trip over my own two feet and my first words ended up being "oh shit". 

There were almost 500 colonists with another 150 workers whose job it was to keep us alive. Everything started off perfectly as we all bonded quickly and there was very few arguments. We were living in a complex that covered about 3 square miles and had enough supplies to keep us going for over a year. There were animals brought to supply us with fresh food and milk.

I was awoken one morning by a siren going off and quickly got dressed to see what was going on. Many of the other colonists were standing around chatting while the workers ran around with panicked expressions on their faces.

I heard one of the workers mention something about an unusual gas before he disappeared around a corner. We were joking around that maybe someone had farted when we heard screaming in the distance.

We all stood there silently trying to decide what to do when the screams were abruptly cut off. Panic began to etch across the others faces when sounds of gunfire started getting closer. 

Everyone looked ready to flee when a dozen workers rounded a corner firing behind them. Many of them were covered in blood and one was being dragged along as both of his legs were missing. I looked around to see most of the other colonists backing away and then it was like a dam bursting as they all started running.

They were colliding with each other and one child who looked no older than 12 ended up being trampled. No one even bothered to check if they were okay. His skull was badly damaged and I could see a piece of his brain sticking out.

I stood there frozen as the workers began moving towards me. They didn't even seem to notice my presence as they were busy reloading and checking the wounded. 

More workers rounded the corner and I felt my blood turn to ice as I saw their faces. Their skin had gone completely red as if they had been lying under a sunbed for a week. The only feature that you could make out on their faces were their eyes which were oozing a yellow liquid. They began to move towards us and I couldn't move as my legs had turned to jelly.

The workers opened fire on them and I watched one their heads explode from a bullet. The body collapsed to the ground and a gas began flowing outwards from the body and began creeping towards us. It reminded me of a mist that you sometimes see covering graveyards and I knew that gas meant certain death.

The surviving creatures quickly overwhelmed the workers and pinned them to the ground. They opened their mouths and a gas forced its way into the workers mouths. The workers that had been injured were ripped apart and their limbs were then discarded.

Within moments the workers skin had began to sizzle and they took on the same appearance of the creatures. Their eyes all locked on mine and began inching towards me. I finally convinced my feet to move and I took off running.

I could hear the sounds of footsteps behind me and knew that they were not far behind. I reached an airlock and began to panic when it didn't open. I began hammering on it and pleading for someone to open it. My prayers were answered as it swung inwards and I rushed inside. I looked around to see about 50bof the colonists cowering inside. 

The airlock was slammed shut behind me and I was relieved that I was safe for the time being. I quickly recounted what I had witnessed to the others while we tried to decide what we should do. Somebody suggested using the escape shuttle as it could ferry us all to safety. It was an automated system so none of us needed to know how to fly it.

We were still trying to decide what to do when someone noticed the gas seeping under the door. It moved incredibly swiftly and latched onto the closest person to the door. He quickly transformed into one of the creatures and before we could stop him had opened the airlock door. It was like a flood as the creatures poured through the door. They spread out and began to try and herd us into the corners.

They attacked anyone that got too close and soon there were very few of us left. I began to dart through them and felt an ice cold hand brush against my arm. I brushed it off and managed to get out without being stopped. 

I heard footsteps rushing towards me and I turned to fight them off. I stopped my fist inches from a terrified looking girls face. She had a pleading look on her face and I grabbed her hand and started running. I grabbed some guns that had been discarded by the workers earlier as it offered some sort of protection.

We turned another corner and saw more of those creatures who were fighting some workers. The workers were destroying the heads of the creatures but were then having to back away from the gas that came out. 

We rushed by them and I heard one of the workers yell something to me but I couldn't make out what he said. Whatever he was saying turned into a scream as one of the creatures must have got to him.

We rsn for what felt like days but it was only a few hours. We found no one else alive and I feared we are the only ones left.

I decided we needed to rest and found us a sheltered area that could easily be defended. The girl I was with hadn't spoken a word since I found her and I feared she may be traumatised. She quickly curled up into the fetal position and fell asleep the second we stopped.

I intended to stay awake and keep an eye out but fell into a deep sleep due to exhaustion. I felt a hand over my mouth when I awoke and could see the girl motioning for me to be quiet.

I cocked my head and could hear the sounds of footsteps nearby. I peered out of where we were hiding and saw dozens of the former colonists and workers marching in unison. They thankfully didn't notice us watching them and were quickly gone.

I moved out and looked in the direction that they hsd gone. Unfortunately for us that was the direction that we needed to go as well. I quickly found us some supplies as we may need them later. 

We spent the next few hours moving towards the escape shuttles. We kept having to double back on ourselves or hide as the creatures were obviously searching for survivors.

We finally reached the shuttles and I quickly launched all but one of the shuttles to stop the creatures from using them to reach Earth. We were about to climb into the final shuttle when the creatures fell upon us. The girl was dragged from my arms and I was forced to watch as the gas took control of her.

I reached for the guns that I had acquired earlier and began firing into the creatures. I felt a pang of sadness as I watched the girls head explode as the bullet entered her right eye.

I jumped into the final shuttle before the gas could reach me and launched it into space. I gazed at Uranus  and wondered what other evils this planet contained.

No one believed my story when I returned and assumed that I was somewhat responsible for what happened. I know that they intend to launch another expedition to get answers. I just hope that whatever they find there doesn't find a way back here to Earth.

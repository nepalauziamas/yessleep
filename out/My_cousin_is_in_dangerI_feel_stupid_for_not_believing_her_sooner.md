My cousin, Maybel, is in danger. No one would believe her, but she always said Uncle Dave was a psychopath, a monster, a murderer. He always laughed it off and said she had such a wild imagination. My whole family thought she was playing a silly prank or fibbing, as kids do. Uncle Dave brought Maybel over for my mom and dad to babysit for the night, she was different. She talked slightly different, more advanced than normal. Her eyes seemed to be a grey color, rather than their normal bright and shining blue. She never once mentioned Uncle Dave as being anything evil while she was over. I decided to ask her about it myself, out of pure curiosity. 
“Why did you say all those things about your dad?” I asked her.
“What are you talking about?” She replied, seemingly puzzled, like she genuinely didn’t know what I was referring to.
“You called him things like a psychopath and a murderer.”
“I would never say those horrid things! I love my daddy!” She seemed like she was beaming with happiness. It didn’t sit right with me, but I dropped it. 
When Uncle Dave came back to pick up Maybel, he seemed to be acting strange. He seemed like he was sad, and like he didn’t even know his own daughter. 
“Daddy! Can Katy come spend the night with us?!” Pleaded Maybel. I wasn’t going to object. I was curious about their home.
“That sounds wonderful! You know, tit for tat!” My mother smiled. “We could definitely use a night to ourselves too.” She had butted in before Uncle Dave could object. 
“Well… uhh… the renovations aren’t quite done yet… and I don’t think we exactly have the space currently…” he stuttered. 
“Pleeease! She can stay in my room!” Maybel begged. 
“I uh… well, I suppose.” Uncle Dave said , reluctantly and I immediately went to my room to pack an overnight bag. I was determined to find out what-if anything-was going on

Flash forward to later that night. Uncle Dave is in the basement, and Aunt Carlie is putting away what was left of dinner. Maybel and I went to her room for the night. 
“Hey Maybs, I have to use the restroom. I’ll be right back.” I said and stood up. 
“Okay, but make sure daddy doesn’t see you out this late. Last time I got caught out of my room last 7:30, I was in huge trouble.”
“I won’t be gone long.” I said as I opened the door. 
I tiptoed to the basement door. I assumed at some point, Uncle Dave must’ve went to bed. I cracked open the door, ever so slightly. It was quite bright. I felt knots in my stomach, but forced myself down the stairs, very quietly. I saw large tube/incubator type things along one wall. There were so many. I noticed one of them had Maybel in it. Was that really her? Who was upstairs with me then? I felt like I couldn’t breathe. Uncle Dave was sitting at a desktop, but by the time I caught my breath, he was facing me. 
“You should’ve listened to Maybel 2.0.”

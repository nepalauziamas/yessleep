It was 9:15 P.M and roommates Emmett and Lee were watching the news. “Damn, the news can be brutal sometimes.” Emmett muttered. “I know right?” Lee replied, “Why did that guy get released? He killed two people and attempt to kill one more person.” “The justice system can be screwed up sometimes.” As they discussed it, the power suddenly went out. “Crap” Lee thought.

Emmett looked out the window, it seemed like the power went out for the entire neighborhood. “Lee! Check to make sure the backup generators are on!” Emmett called out. “On it!” Lee said as he opened the basement door and went down, his steps getting more faint as he went down

Soon the steps became more clearer as Lee came back up, two flashlights in one hand. “Emmett!, I’ve got-“ “Emmett?”

Emmett was staring at the TV. “Lee, I think something is wrong with the T.V” “What are you talking about?” Emmett pointed at the T.V, four single words were shown. **”You.Must.Get.Down”** Along with static.

“That doesn’t make sense how is our T.V still on?!” Lee barked. “Maybe it’s a-“ Suddenly a loud crash was heard from one of the men’s room. “Oh shit, I think there’s a burglar!” Emmett muttered.

Then another crash coming from the kitchen. “Are we being robbed?!” whispered Emmett. Lee pulled out his pistol and rushed to the kitchen. There was a groaning and growling sound coming directly from the kitchen.

At that moment, there was a sudden scream, but it did not sound human. The scream was cut off by the sound a gun firing. Lee stepped out. There was a black liquid on his sweater. “We need to get the fuck out of here…” he said coldly with fear. Suddenly in the blink of an eye, something slices Emmett body in half. Both Lee’s upper and lower half collapsed to the floor and a pool of blood formed.

Emmett screamed as he rushed to the door, but when he opened the front door, Emmett almost had a heart attack. There stood a black creature with large claws and talons and was a feet larger than Emmett with yellow glowing eyes.

Emmett stepped back in fear and in doing that he bumped into something. Emmett turned to face a exact same copy of the creature he saw at the front door, before he knew it, he was surrounded.

There were now 6 exact clones of the black creatures and they stood around Emmett and blocked every single entry of escape. 

They approached Emmett and then lunged at him displaying their fierce and horrific fangs. Emmett closed his eyes and screamed in fright as they leapt towards him…

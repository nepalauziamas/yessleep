Given the circumstances, I'm not sure if I'm ever going to feel safe. I probably shouldn't have laid my eyes on that.....thing, or what I once thought was a woman.

To all of you reading this, I won't give you my name, or phone number, or address, or whatever means you wish to contact me, so don't bother asking. There's no point in doing so, anyway. For now, I'll stick with the usual alias: John Doe.

What started as what I expected to be a beautiful tourist vacation at one of the most historical sites, ends up becoming one of the most horrendous decisions I've ever made.

You see, it all started with a simple trip to Japan, specifically Kyoto and Miyazaki. My time in Kyoto was relaxing, and I got to visit some old shrines, let alone walk the paths that lead to them. From what I could tell, people still take care of the old temple I visited, and got to learn about the art of making tea and what their customs are in regards to tea ceremonies. I'm not going to lie, it was an experience I'll never forget. I enjoyed every moment I had at the place. Other than the nearby cities and busy streets in Kyoto, there were breathtaking sceneries and historical places to visit.

The last on the list during my tourist vacation, was Miyazaki. I wish that Kyoto was the only place that I decide to visit before leaving, because now I wish I hadn't gone to my second and last destination for visiting. While I admired the countryside and the people who live there differently from those living in cities, this place was where my unfortunate encounter occurred. I just didn't understand why though. I'm only a tourist there, and after learning more backstories of this evil entity, it was said this entity is known to target mostly children and locals. But even tourists are a target of its liking, it seems, since I now have to deal with it.

To start this off, while I was in Miyazaki, I got to enjoy the view of the mountainside, and got to walk in the forest nearby. There was a pathway I could take, that leads in and out. Along with that, there were some nearby hedges where one part of the pathway lead to. Now to my utmost regret, I decided to go through the pathway that leads through the hedges. Those hedges were pretty tall, so I could not see anyone else walking on the pathway other than in front and behind me. There was no one else in the area, which was interesting. After seeing a place like this, I'd suspect that this area would be a hotspot for tourists to pay a visit. But this is where my encounter began, and perhaps explains why not many tourists go to this area.

While I was walking through the hedges, I eventually came across, someone, walking in the opposite direction. While the person was distant, I was able to make out a white dress along with a white hat. I also noticed that this person appeared to be extremely tall, perhaps 8 feet. As I got closer and closer to the figure, my assumptions were confirmed. This person appeared to be a woman, wearing a white dress and a white hat, which appeared longer on all sides. She was also very tall, with her head being just as high as the top of the hedges. This astonished me. "How can someone be that tall?" I muttered to myself. After walking closer to her, I suddenly hear this strange sound coming from her. What was 'off' about this ordeal, was not only the repetition of the sound she was making, but the sound itself she was making. This sound of hers, did not seem to be sounds from a woman, but from a man, with a deep, masculine voice. As I got close enough, I stopped to see if I can get a better look. Shockingly, the woman did the same thing. Even stranger, was this sudden feeling of dread and terror creeping up on me, as if telling me I'm in grave danger.

Realizing my surroundings, the woman was looking down at the ground, not making eye contact. This was odd at first, until she turned her head to look up at me. Never in my life had I felt so horrified, but at the same time could not explain this feeling of horror and dread. The woman, did not seem normal. Her face was very pale, and she had these 'red' pupils in her eyes. She was looking right at me, which made me smile for a quick second and then frown as my pretentious greeting was quickly replaced by the feeling of dread. Then, to add to my horror, she gave me a really big smile. It was so big, it looked like it was about to stretch from ear to ear. Suddenly, I felt this chilling sensation, telling me I'm about to die. This went on for a few moments, until she eventually turned her head back down and walked past me, emitting that strange sound once again. As we got far away from each other, the sound had finally stopped. Nevertheless, I decided to find my way back out. Still, I was terrified of the incident. In time, I came out of that maze of hedges, and walked towards a local village.

Some of the locals were astonished to see me, but it wasn't a happy greeting. One local, who appeared to be an elderly man, and was busy picking rice from his field, uttered something strange. Since I took Japanese, I understood what he said, which made yet another chill run through.

"Not many people, come out of there alive, when they see her. He must be lucky if he saw her, or if she wasn't there."

"Excuse me?" I spoke back, in his native tongue.

"You understood me?" the old man said.

"Yes. What did you mean by that?" I asked the old man, desperate to get answers to what happened.

"It sounds like you have never heard of the legend of the eight foot tall woman. Seeming that you're a tourist visiting this place, I'm not surprised." he said.

"What does this have to do with that tall lady I saw earlier?" I then asked.

"Was she making a strange sound?" he asked me.

As soon as I confirmed what he said, he turned to look at me, now showing a serious face. He went on to tell me of this entity and how she appears to her victims. After hearing everything about her, I could feel my stomach drop like an anchor. It was that woman. But why, though? Why didn't she do it? Why didn't she take the opportunity to take me away, and make me disappear from this world forever?

"The moment she looks at you and smiles, you are liked by her. This means in time, you will be taken. The fact you are still here, means she decided not to press on with the attack yet." the man explained.

Against my better judgment, I decided that I didn't want to hear no more. I admit, I couldn't take any more of it, after hearing about what happened to the last group of people who encountered, and the fact I'm next on her list. But as I was about to walk away, trying to get my mind off of what I saw, just thinking it might have been someone pulling a prank on me, the old man insisted on something that caught my attention.

"I strongly suggest you place 4 bowls of salt in the corners of where you sleep. Make sure you have a buddha statue sitting on a table or a shelf if possible. If you do not heed these instructions, then she will come for you, and no one will know you even existed."

I listened, but I shrugged it off and thought nothing of it. As I started walking away from him...

"Ignorant tourist."

Those were the last two words that came out of his mouth, because he said nothing else after that. I should have listened, but I guess he was right. I was such an ignorant fool, not listening at all. After I read and researched about this eight foot tall entity, I read articles, pointing out that this entity is just an urban legend, or perhaps a mythical tale meant to scare children who do bad or misbehave.

After my time in Miyazaki, I went back to Tokyo. It was a long trip back, but it was still better than still being at that place. However, my trip back wasn't comforting at the very least. In my peripheral, I saw someone in the distance. I glanced to see who it was, only to see it was that same woman I saw in the maze of hedges. My heart began to pound once I laid eyes on her. She looked at me and gave me that creepy smile. I turned to look away, and I kept my head down, as to not make any eye contact. I didn't dare turn my head back up and look out the window, should I ever see that same person again. Soon as I was finally back in the city, I was comfortable enough to look around and not see the woman. So I went to grab a bite to eat at a nearby restaurant, before calling it a night. This was my last night here after all, since I have to fly back tomorrow in the morning. While I was second in line to order, I saw a familiar face.

No, it wasn't the woman. In fact, it was something much more pleasant than that. It was someone I recognized back at the University in Arizona. He was an exchange student from this country. My old friend, whom I'll call, Toshi. It's not his real name, but its the same reason I told you in the beginning. The fact I'm seeing him again, made me happy to see that he was doing okay. Unfortunately, I blame myself for making this night, the last night of his life. As he turned to look at me, he got a good look, and immediately recognized me.

"John!?" he said, and I nodded. It didn't take long for him to embrace me with a hug. He and I have been best friends since our time in college, but ever since a family emergency, he had to leave back home. Sadly, he never came back, because the pandemic struck shortly after his return home to see his grandmother, who was on her deathbed at the time. So to see his face once again, brought joy to my eyes. Apparently, this made me forget the whole ordeal with the eight foot tall entity. Normally, I would be thankful for that. But sadly, this lead to an unfortunate situation that I still blame myself for, even to this day.

We exchanged thoughts for a few hours, speaking of our times in our home countries, telling me that he had been keeping himself busy throughout his days. I told him about the time we shared a room, and how his loud snoring sometimes keeps me up all night, and he laughed about it. He mentioned that Japan isn't some place you would think working here is fun and games. People work themselves to death, even for the sake of making their bosses happy and proud. This is not the case in America, and it sounded to me that Japan is a country of workaholics. So it interested me, to hear what life is like when you're living here as a citizen instead of being a tourist, enjoying your time before your departure. To finish our night together, we drank some sake. Although I admit, I drank a little too much, and I was drunk as hell to even go back to my hotel. Luckily, he told me that his place is nearby and allowed me to stay the night at his place. I understood this and nodded, since I couldn't speak so well. In fact, I was feeling more sleepy than able to speak.

Soon as we got to his place, he helped me walk into his house. From what I could tell, he was living in a traditional Japanese home, instead of a modern home, or an apartment. He helped me walk into a room. Sadly, there wasn't a bed in sight, but there was a small blanket with what I assumed to be the 'pillow' I could lay my head on. I laid down on it, and he made his way to his bedroom. When I sat up, my vision was a bit hazy, but I was able to make out some things. I looked around, and I noticed that this room had 4 bowls of salt in the corners, a window, and in the center of the room was a small, wooden table with a buddhist statue. This was very interesting at first, but upon looking at these things, I felt struck with a sense of familiarity. But then again, I couldn't keep my mind on it, since I was not only drunk, but feeling sleepy. Eventually, after a few moments, I fell asleep and felt my head land on the pillow.

I awoke to the sound of tapping at the window. I took out my phone, and saw that the time was now 2:34 in the morning. I also felt sober too, upon waking up. I looked to the source of the sound, only to see someone on the other side of the window, tapping on it. A familiar sound came through.

"Hey John! It's me, Toshi! Can you let me in through the front door!? I locked myself out!"

I remember him taking me into this room and walking outside, and I thought "Damn, he was so drunk that he probably locked himself out and forgot his house keys." I stood up and took another look at who I thought was Toshi.

"Good, you're up. Please, open the front door for me."

I was about to do this, when something was off. I could hear snoring, that familiar snoring sound. It was coming from what I assumed to be Toshi's room. He was sleeping.

"Open the front door, John!" it said, now in an angry tone.

The voice also sounded slightly different. When I turned to look at the figure, I got a good look at the silhouette that was being shined down by the bright moonlight. This thing outside had long hair, and this realization hit me. Toshi is bald. He shaves his head every day. If that's not Toshi, then who the hell is that!? Since I couldn't see its face, I immediately took out my phone and turned the flashlight on. As soon as I pointed my flashlight directly at the figure, I fell backwards, screaming. This was a woman, but not just any woman. It was that same woman. Only this time, she appeared a little different. She still had that pale face and red pupils, but this time, her mouth was wide open. She had teeth that appeared to be very sharp and carnivorous, and behind it, was just nothing but a gaping void in her mouth. She was tapping at the window, with a smile that was wide with her mouth open, staring at me.

"Open the door, John." it said, mocking my friend's voice, despite the fact I know its not him. Right at that moment, she simply moved away from the window. I thought after that, it was all over. But after several long moments, that hopeful feeling was quickly washed away.

"Open this door and let me in, John." she now said, knocking on the door to my room, speaking to me with a much deeper masculine voice, followed by those strange sounds she made back at the hedges. From what I could tell, she sounded like she was walking left and right in front of the bedroom door, all the while emitting those sounds and constantly knocking on the door.

"Fuck you! Get away from me, you fucking demon!" I yelled at her.

"But I only want to talk to you. Its been a while since I've seen you." she said, with the sound of Toshi's voice. Apparently, this entity was mocking me, and trying to get me to come out. The snoring sounds stopped, and I heard yet a more familiar voice.

"Who's there!?" Toshi yelled. This drew the attention of the woman, because she stopped emitting the sounds and knocking on the door. That's when I heard a door open, and Toshi came out to check up on me.

"John, are you-" He stopped, dead in his tracks. I could imagine what he was looking at.

"FUCK!" is the last word I heard him say, before hearing his footsteps take off from me. What followed was a horrible, guttering roar, along with another sound of footsteps chasing after him. A loud roaring sound could be heard again, followed by a blood-curdling scream. Shortly after that, nothing. I looked to the window, only to see nothing but the night sky along with the moonlight shining through. At the very least, everything went quiet, save for the sound of wind outside. Nevertheless, I dare not to open that door nor peak out that window again. Eventually, I fell asleep.

Morning came, and I woke up. While I was still shaken from last night's event, I was happy to see that sunlight through the window. I hesitantly opened the door to my bedroom, but thankfully no one was there. I slowly but cautiously crept through the hallway and into the living room, believing she'll jump at me at any moment. But, nothing happened. As soon as I got to the living room, I was met with the most horrifying sight. There was blood, everywhere in the living room. But the most horrifying of all, was seeing my friend's head next to the bloody couch. His face, looked like he had seen the devil. Out of instinct, I immediately took out my phone and called the police.

After a few minutes of waiting, they arrived. I told them everything that happened, including what I had seen. But none of them believed me. That was, until one of them came out of the room, holding one of the bowls that was in the corner. The salt in the bowl, had turned completely black. While my story still wasn't bought, it was said that when the bowl of salt turns black, it means that an evil presence is nearby. However, because there was a lack of evidence leading to the eight foot tall thing being that culprit, it was assumed to be a wild animal, more specifically a Yezo brown bear, that my friend had a grave misfortune to encounter. However, my mind was clear as day could be. I know what I saw, and that was no brown bear.

It's been a few days now, since that incident. I'm back at my home country. Normally, I would be safe and sound, since I'm far away from that country. I wouldn't have suspected her to be following me to my homeland. But strangely, I get that chilling feeling that she isn't through with me. Not only that, I also pray that my friend is given a proper resting place. It's my fault that he's dead now. If only I had recalled what I had seen and told him about it, then perhaps he would still be alive, since he would've stayed with me in that room. Then we'd both be okay. It saddens me to realize that he's gone now. It makes me feel so guilty, and now I think that it should've been me that she took. He didn't deserve it. But the old man was right. I was an ignorant tourist.

I'm in the back seat of my car, with my wife driving us back home, and our son sitting in the front passenger's seat, after we just picked him up from baseball practice. As I said, I've had this chilling feeling she isn't through with me. What horrified me, is the chance that I was right. My suspicions were confirmed. As soon as I laid eyes on someone through the window in the back of our car, I noticed a familiar look or appearance, one that brought yet another chill through my spine.

Just out the window, there was a woman, who appeared to be eight feet tall, and she was wearing a white dress and white hat. Just at that moment, after looking at her and observing her appearance, she took one look at me, observing me with a pale face and red pupils in her eyes, and gave me a very big smile.

im writing this as it’s happening so i may need to update. please dont be bothered by typos , im a mess right now i havent slept in days and i cant stop shaking. i just need to get my thoughts out, someone needs to know in case something happens to me. 

it started…i dont know how long ago. maybe a few days ? a week ? i dont know for sure. but i remember where i was and what i was doing. it was early in the am hours, the sun still sunken in the sky. i woke up, unsure why. i didnt have to pee and i wasnt thirsty. i was perfectly comfortable in every way, but thats not an uncommon occurrence for me to wake up for nothing. often i can just fall back asleep but this night i had a feeling i couldnt shake off. a feeling of what i didnt know, but it wasnt a good feeling thats for sure. it was dark in all the rooms in my house. i have a roommate but she works graveyard shift so she wasnt home, she’s actually never home. she comes home to shower and get food once in a blue moon, usually off working or with her party animal friends and boyfriend. im used to being alone. i never have a second thought about it. but this night it was different. 

when i had woken i couldnt quite put my finger on what was wrong, i couldnt name the feeling i got. but the longer i was up, the more that feeling grew. i remember it vividly, i was in the kitchen getting a glass of water, wearing just my underwear ready to get back into bed despite my uneasiness. 

but thats when it hit me. 

i knew that feeling. 

the feeling of being watched. 

i could feel eyes burning in the back of my neck. now that i knew this feeling and gave it a name i couldnt shake it. of course i started to get creeped out, still standing in my dark kitchen. i walked towards the light switch nearby a doorway to the pitch black hall. and thats when it caught my eye. the shape of a head peeking from the doorway, low to the ground as if crouched. it was so dark i could barely see but i knew i could make out an image of a bald head, pale skin, black soulless eyes and a disgusting dripping mouth. its long sharp fingers gripping the doorframe, its bony elbow and knee poking out from behind the wall. i screamed, as most would do in my situation, and instinctively turned on the light and it was gone. 
it was gone. just like that. 

phew, okay. im just being paranoid, i thought. i caught my breath, sighing. i set my cup down on the counter and decided i should head back to bed, i must be seeing things. but i couldnt shake that damn feeling that continues to plague me. it looked too real it felt too real. it was too real. but i dont believe in paranormal things so i didnt know what to make of it. i stepped out in the hallway, heart thumping out of my chest like an old cartoon. i looked down to the end and there it was again, crouched, peeking at me from behind a corner. i stared at it, it was farther away this time but i knew i saw it clear as day. i didnt take my eyes off of it as i reached slowly, so slowly it felt like i was frozen in time locking eyes with this fucking thing in my house, nd flicked the switch. the light buzzed and hummed as it turned on and just as i flipped the switch it was gone. just like that. i stood frozen still, hand still on the switch. even slower than when i turned it on, i turned the light back off and there it was again. humanoid creature, tall skinny and bony with yellowish pale skin with a tint of green and disgusting veins hunched on the ground fucking peeking at me from around the corner but this time it was a lot closer. instead of at the end of the hallway, it was in the open doorway to my computer room peeking at me from behind the doorframe. very quickly i turned the light back on still frozen in fear. absolutely horrifed i ran back to my room, turning on every light as i went. i didnt sleep that night and i havent gotten much since. 

this has continued ever since. hes getting closer. even when i have the lights on he still finds me. he hides in the shadows. hes everywhere. i cant even sit on my couch and watch tv in the middle of the day without seeing him peeking over the arm of my couch, those beady black eyes and disgusting shark like teeth. peeking from the shadow behind the door. underneath my kitchen table. behind my shower curtain. 

ive tried to escape him but i cant. currently im staying in a hotel with huge windows, curtains open and i even brought as many lights as i could plug in to avoid having any shadows big enough for him to hide in. i dont feel safe in my home, i cant get enough light in there. he just keeps getting closer and i dont know what will happen when he gets to me. i dont know who to tell, i dont want anyone thinking im crazy, no one would believe me anyway. im fucking scared. i cant shake the feeling of being watched. i dont know where he came from. i dont know what to do. please, i need advice. i will update when i get the chance.

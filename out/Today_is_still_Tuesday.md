Today is still Tuesday.  It's been Tuesday for...I don't know, I've gave up on trying to keep track.  It's been Tuesday, 10:24am for God knows how long and I can't make it stop. Time passes, sure, the sun goes down and comes back up, but no matter what every clock in the house says 10:24 and every digital calendar tells it's Tuesday. I've watched as time passes, 10:24 becomes 10:25, 10:26, 10:27...as long as I look at the clock. The minute I look away?  10:24am. And I can't get anyone on the phone. My wife, my boss, my daughter's daycare, my parents; straight to voicemail. I'm getting lots of texts and e-mails from everyone telling me there's nothing wrong, they're fine, but I CANNOT get anyone to answer the phone.  I'm probably rambling, let me back up and explain.

When the COVID epidemic hit, like most companies, mine switched to working remotely from home. It worked out great for me, because our daughter was born just before things ramped up so we really needed to be home with her since her daycare shut down. Once things started opening back up, daycare did as well and at that point we REALLY needed her at daycare. My wife's office opened back up, but my company recognized we could do  our jobs just as well, if not better, at home than in the office so they kind of let us working in the office or at home at our own leisure, provided we're getting our work done.

At some point, I can't even remember how long ago, my wife left to drop our daughter off at daycare and just...never came home. I typically get wrapped up in what I'm doing, so didn't notice at first, but every time I looked down at my phone the time still read: 10:24am.  At first I thought something was going on with the clocks on my phone and computer, but then I noticed the microwave and oven didn't seem to be working either. Confused, I texted my wife, but she assured me there wasn't anything weird on her end. As the day went on, and I started feeling more and more paranoid, I asked her what time she had. After some convincing, she told me: 10:24.

I tried to explain NONE of the clocks changed, but she kind of just brushed me off and told me she was busy and couldn't talk. I'm not a goldfish, so I know that time is passing, so as the day went on I continued getting more and more anxious. I tried to call her, but all I got was voicemail. As the sun started going down and it started getting darker, I started to worry. I asked if she would be leaving soon to pick up our daughter, but she assured me she would get her in about 6 hours when she gets out of work.

Night fell, and she never came home. When she would answer me, which was only by text, it was to tell me nothing is wrong but she's really busy and can't talk right now. The following day, after a completely sleepless night of fear and anger I decide she's run off somewhere, and try to reach our daughter's daycare. Surely they could tell me when my wife picked up our daughter yesterday and maybe knew if something seemed wrong? I call the main office and...voicemail. I e-mail the director, and she assures me everything is fine and my wife dropped our daughter off on that day, Tuesday at 7:30am.

I've made countless similar e-mails and text messages, and it's all the same. And I could almost live with it, if it weren't for the fact that nothing in our house seems to change. Any food I eat reappears, garbage I throw away disappears from the garbage can, anything I put from one place to another materializes back in its original spot. Not right in front of my eyes, but if I leave the room? It's as if whatever I did in that room never happened.

I'll give you all an example. I've got a bowl of 5 bananas on the counter in my kitchen, which has been there for who the eff knows. I eat one, and now I've got 4. And there will always be 4, as long as I sit there and look at them. Or even as long as I'm in the kitchen. But if I walk away to go to the bathroom or get something out of my office? 5 bananas, in a bowl, yellow as the day we bought them.

And I'm almost positive, it's not like magic. Someone, or something, is doing it. And the only reason I say that at this point, is because I hear things. Our house is decent sized, not huge but large enough. We moved in right around when my daughter was born and COVID started. Our previous house was a one-story two-bedroom house, and with my wife and I working from home with an infant we were all always on top of each other. I joked with my wife when we first moved in how weird it was being in a house where I sometimes don't know where she was because we could always hear eachother no matter what part of the house we were in. What I'm trying to say is, it's a house where you can leave one room and not necessarily know what's happening in another.

And what's happening is often...something. When I leave a room, I hear things. Footsteps. Doors opening. Doors closing. Maybe a window every now and then?

What often happens is something like this: I'll eat a bowl of cereal and a cup of coffee, wash them, and put them in the dish strainer, eat an apple or a banana, and sit around my living room getting work done. I used to work in the office, but now I need to be in the center of the house for my own sanity. Eventually I'll get up to use the bathroom or grab my slippers or just get something I need, and I'll start hearing it. A door opens somewhere, maybe there's footsteps, maybe there's not, maybe another door somewhere closes. I walk back into the living room, whatever dishes I've used are back in the cupboard and I've got 5 bananas or apples again. And maybe, MAYBE I could live with all of this, if it weren't for the fact that I can't leave.

I don't know why, for some reason I can't leave the house. I haven't been outside in I don't know how long. And believe me, I've tried. I'm not sure what a panic attack feels like, but it's like I get a major panic attack any time I try to walk out the door. I don't know if it's all in my head, or if I'm being drugged, or haunted, or hell maybe I'm in a coma and this is what a coma is like in 2020 (if it even still is?) All I know is, I miss my wife, I miss my daughter, and I have no idea if they're really okay.

So here I sit. Screaming into the void. On a Tuesday, at 10:24am.

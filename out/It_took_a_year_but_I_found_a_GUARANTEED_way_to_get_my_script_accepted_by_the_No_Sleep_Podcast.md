I woke up in front of my computer with my pants around my ankles, an empty glass of whisky on the table, and a headache so pure that I expected it to split cleanly through my skull and leave a sizzling hole in the wooden floor at my feet.

‘What the fuck did I write last night?’ I wondered blearily as my eyes screeched in protest at the computer screen. 

My jaw slowly dropped as I looked over the tale.

“This changes everything,” I whispered to myself. 

[The last story I submitted to the No Sleep Podcast had been rejected, so the sensible way to avoid such a future problem was to avoid ever submitting a story again. I had attempted to contact them in person, which is how I found out that David Cummings is secretly a vampire masquerading as a common mortal.](https://redd.it/n2fs8m)

For some reason, everyone looks at me like I’m an idiot when I try to tell them the truth. 

So I’d given up on the whole prospect, right up until reading my own story. 

Some tales *affect* us in ways that leave us permanently changed. Words can prod our minds in just the right way to find the natural resonance of our unspoken souls, bringing them to life with a lyrical dance that anticipates every primal yearning before we feel it ourselves. The perfect tale will writhe alongside a person’s spirit like two star-crossed lovers who know each other’s needs better than they know their own bodies. Only then can we hold a mirror to the basest part of our savage essence and say, “this is beautiful in every way that it is broken.”

And tits, a good story needs some tits. 

So I prepared myself to meet a vampire. I grabbed the standard weapons and headed out to meet David Cummings. 

It was another cold, gray Canadian morning as I headed out into the street. That was perfect; my trench coat allowed me to hide every supply that I needed. I smiled.

This story was going to be the best they’d ever seen. 

I knocked on the door of the NSP headquarters, and it was again opened by a large, jovial-looking man in glasses. He peered down at me and his face instantly fell. “You again? We still haven’t fixed the window that you broke, and it was very impolite to leave all that blood on the carpet.”

I pushed past him, ran into the building, and opened my coat. “I know your secret this time, David Cummings!” I pulled out a wooden stake. “Now I’m one step ahead of you!” I pointed it threateningly at his face. 

He yanked it from my hands and snapped it in half. “That was kind of rude.”

I froze. “Um, I didn’t expect you to react like that.”

He folded his arms and raised an eyebrow. “Didn’t expect me to fight back against being stabbed?”

I scratched the back of my head in doubt. “I guess I figured vampires would be really scared of wooden stakes, because those are deadly to vampires.”

“They’re deadly to *all* people, so I reacted like anyone else would.”

“Oh.” I stepped back and reached into my pocket. “Fortunately, I’ve got this!” I pulled out a clove of garlic. 

He looked down at the floor and sighed. “Yes, garlic is very bad for my kind. It killed a friend’s grandmother last year when she didn’t realize it was in her pasta.”

“Oh.” I shuffled my feet. “That’s kind of a downer.”

“So is using it against *me*. What were you hoping, that I would eat it?”

I looked at the clove. “Um. I didn’t really have a plan, so… yes? Would you mind?”

He grunted. “Look, this is the second time you’ve forced yourself into my place of business while making threats of bodily harm. I really hate to push it this far, but you’ve left me no choice: I’m afraid that I’m going to have to break the Canadian rule and ask you to leave.”

I could have departed there and then.

Instead, I threw the garlic at his head and ran deeper into the building.

Where I stopped dead, dropping my script to the floor. 

Four witches – yes, honest-to-God *witches* - stood around a boiling cauldron. I had clearly interrupted some sort of dark rite. They stared up at me in shock and anger. 

“Alex!” screamed the head witch. “Morgan! Ashley! Bind him!” 

“Now just a minute, Jessica,” ordered British-sounding witch as she emerged from the shadows. “I’m Head Witch, so I’ll tell them what to do.”

Jessica put her hands on her hips. “Fine, Olivia. What do you want them to do?”

Olivia’s shoulders slumped. “I'm the boss, but do whatever Jessica says.” 

I had just enough time to start screaming when the three witches shouted in unison:

“*Cialis!*”

Suddenly my muscles were rock-hard and too stiff to move. Jessica waved her hand, and I was lifted off the ground. 

People have told stories about what scares them since time immemorial. But until you’ve lost complete control of your body, you have truly never understood fear. I couldn’t flex, couldn’t blink, couldn’t shit my pants like I would have if there was any control left in me. But my entire body was at the complete mercy of supernatural phenomena that I could never hope to understand or resist.

It was in that moment that I first truly understood my own mortality. 

A door opened. It led to steps that disappeared in darkness. My soul silently wept as I floated helplessly into the unknown, completely powerless as the light slowly disappeared from my life. 

I don’t know how long I was in sensory deprivation before a glowing being appeared, walking steadily closer to me. 

“Be free!”

I recognized Olivia’s voice just as I regained all muscle control. Instantly, I sprang to my feet.

Since she was illuminated, Olivia was the only person I could see. She raised her hand, snapped her fingers, and suddenly rows of torches burst to life. 

I was in some sort of an underground dungeon. Olivia was flanked by David and a bearded man. They stood between me and the stairway to freedom.

“You can’t keep me here,” I growled.

“Yes, we can. That’s why I brought Atticus,” she explained.

“Is that right?” I asked, my heart jackhammering. “Don’t mess around, just tell me: what’s your supernatural ability?”

“I have a baseball bat,” he said while hefting a Louisville Slugger onto his shoulder. 

I staggered backwards and slammed against the stone wall. Olivia snapped her fingers again. Chains emerged from the ground like snakes and bound me firmly in place. 

“What the fuck are you going to do to me?” I screamed while struggling fruitlessly against my bonds.

“Congratulations, Pat,” David responded, his voice light. “You’re going to be the first subject in our ‘Thousand Monkeys’ project!” 

I tried, and failed, to move my arms close enough to my face to wipe away the tears. “What the hell is that?” I asked in a trembling voice.

“Well,” David continued, “you know the saying that a thousand monkeys pounding away on a thousand typewriters will eventually produce the greatest story ever told, given enough time? After evaluating your writing, we believe that you could accomplish this task in less than fifty percent of the time that it would take a monkey!”

“Fifty percent?” I whined. “The stories I gave you were *good*.”

David lifted the script I had dropped upstairs. “These stories are *not* good, Pat. They’re just about a perverted clown named Uncle Beans who stalks people in the absolute creepiest ways. It’s *way* beyond the pale. And the whole thing is just one long body horror tale from beginning to end. Seriously, I threw up after reading it.”

“Some people like it,” I whispered. 

“And I worry for the well-being of those people,” David answered with a note of finality. “Olivia?”

She snapped her fingers, and a laptop appeared at my feet.

“Start writing. The laptop’s on a shared network with our staff. Erica will be down periodically with tea and crumpets so that you don’t starve to death. Peter – hell, Peter might be here right now. Sometimes he sheds his corporeal essence and becomes one with the dungeon itself.” He smiled broadly. “Happy writing!”

My chains fell just low enough to free my arms so that I could reach the laptop.

“Ha!” I yelled, trying to deny my own hopelessness, “you haven’t thought this through! I’m just going to post the truth online, and your cover will be blown! Then people will come rescue me!”

David threw back his head and laughed. “Don’t you get it, Pat? We tell true stories on the podcast all the time! No one will believe you! In fact, go ahead and tell the true story of everything that just happened and post it online! No one is [coming to rescue you](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/)!”

I'm not sure how much longer I have. No one believes my story. None of my doctors. My family and friends are supportive, but they think I've lost my mind. If I haven't lost it already, I'll probably lose it along with everything else that's been taken from me. 

&#x200B;

This all started on a summer night when I was fourteen. 

&#x200B;

My family and I had just come home from the movies. When I got out of the car, the air was still and warm. If it wasn't for the porch light, we would have been shrouded in the same blackness up in the sky. In spite of the darkness, the atmosphere seemed calm. 

&#x200B;

"Don't forget you have to take the garbage out," my brother said. 

&#x200B;

"Oh come on I'll do it in the morning," I said. 

&#x200B;

My dad gave me a look and said, "they pick it up real early. Are you going to get up at 5 to take it out". I didn't say anything. 

"Just take it out tonight," he said. 

&#x200B;

"Yeah, I had to take it out last week," my brother said. 

&#x200B;

We have a long driveway that has the garage at one end and the street at the other. The driveway was dark and my mind filled the yard with rabid skunks and possums that ate there own. I rushed as quietly as I could to the bins and dragged them to the street. They made a terrible racket. 

&#x200B;

I was almost to the street when I heard a clank. My brother had dropped three bags of trash on the porch. I stopped dragging the bins and reluctantly walked back to collect them. The bags were heavier than usual and I had to drag one of them more than carry it. Something was rolling on the ground behind me. A bag had torn and there were jars and cans rolling around. 

&#x200B;

I took the two bags that were still intact and put them in the bins. Muttering bad words to myself I sauntered back to the rolling jars and cans. Some of them were sticky and others were wet. I cursed my brother as I crouched down to collect the trash and bundled it up into the torn bag, holding it like a swaddled baby. Our porch light started flickering and I noticed a strange glow. 

&#x200B;

When I turned around, something was standing a few feet in front of me. It was somewhat humanoid in form, yet its form seemed "loose" somehow.  This thing, whatever it was, appeared to be made of some sort of strange electricity. Its colors shifted all over, yellow, orange, and white.  The pulse of its transformations was hypnotic. 

&#x200B;

I stood there with my mouth agape, holding the swaddled trash. My mind was filled with such terror and wonder, that I seemed to be frozen in place. At least that is what I thought at the time. It felt like the thing was examining me somehow. As I peered into its "face", my own face seemed to "materialize" on  it like some bizarre transmission. The thing looked at me with my own face for what felt like an eternity. Suddenly, the thing disappeared. I don't remember it running off, beaming away, or being taken up in a ship. It was just gone. 

&#x200B;

For a moment I stood there. I could feel my mobility had returned, but I wasn't ready to use it. What I had seen was unbelievable.

&#x200B;

 "Are you still out there," my Dad yelled out to me. 

&#x200B;

"Yes," I said in a meek voice. No back talk, no blaming my brother. I simply took the garbage out to the bin and went inside. 

&#x200B;

"Are you alright," my Dad asked. 

&#x200B;

"I, I'm fine," I said in that same meek voice. 

&#x200B;

"Did you see something out there". 

&#x200B;

I simply shook my head, went upstairs, and got ready for bed. 

&#x200B;

After a few weeks had passed I was more curious than afraid. I began consuming every bit of media I could get about paranormal occurrences. One day my brother and my best friend asked me what I was up to. I decided to come clean with them. 

&#x200B;

"Are you crazy," my brother asked me. 

&#x200B;

"Are you like.....on something," my best friend asked.

&#x200B;

 No matter how much I tried to explain, they didn't believe me.

&#x200B;

One day while reading through one of my books, I found what I was looking for. My blood ran cold, and the hair on my arms stood up. There it was, in a black and white photograph. The lack of color didn't detract from my dread, but somehow the black and white did not do the thing justice. A form that looked like a man made of television snow. According to this book the thing was in fact, an alien. The author didn't seem to know whether the thing was an extra-terrestrial or extra-dimensional being. Perhaps, for some reason, the author didn't want to know. 

&#x200B;

Scholars often have the luxury to ponder things at a safe distance. They are too objective or detached from a situation to be afraid like those who experience it firsthand.  However, there are times when their knowledge imbues them with a sense of understanding, which in turn curses them with a sense of foreboding that strays beyond average comprehension. 

&#x200B;

I scoured the internet for images of the alien. When I saw a gallery of the thing staring back at me, my heart sank. I wondered if it was a thing, or things. With this realization, fear had taken the place of curiosity. I didn't dare read what the book had to say on the matter. Nor did I have the will to see what the internet had to offer on the subject. I closed the image search and book.

&#x200B;

My parents approached me a few days later. 

&#x200B;

"Your brother told us about what you.....We would like you to go talk to someone," my mom said.

&#x200B;

 "A shrink," I asked. 

&#x200B;

"A psychologist," my dad said. 

&#x200B;

"We just want to you to get the help that you need" she said. Both of them looked scared. 

&#x200B;

I am blessed that I have people who care about me. They were so desperate to help me. So many people aren't as lucky as I am in that regard.  Unfortunately, I don't think anyone could offer me the help I truly need. 

&#x200B;

First I went to the psychologist. We talked about what happened that night. He wanted to know what I thought it "meant". 

&#x200B;

A short time after that my fingers started to twist into strange knots. My voice would utter strange involuntary sounds. Then I started to hold my breath. Not because I wanted to, but because something was making me. Every time this happened, the lights would flicker and televisions, radios, and computers switched on and off. 

&#x200B;

When I started holding my breath, my shrink decided I needed pharmacological help. I was prescribed a regimen of anti-anxiety meds, anti-psychotics, and muscle relaxants. They helped a little bit, for a short while. 

&#x200B;

My legs started to have trouble holding me up. Soon after that I found myself stuck in a wheelchair. I could technically walk and stand, but my brain wouldn't allow it. That's when the neurologists got involved. 

&#x200B;

After a battery of tests and my family's lifesavings, the neurologists had no answer for my parents. We were on the verge of losing everything. Somehow my parents managed. I am so grateful they never gave up on me. 

&#x200B;

Things got better about five years after that. The vocal and breath phenomena had stopped. I was even able to get a degree online. It was easy. I had spent the rest of my youth in books and on the computer, soaking up information like a sponge. It was my only choice really. I thought maybe things were starting to turn around. 

&#x200B;

Two years later my parents were clipped by a trucker that fell asleep at the wheel. My parents had been my rock for so long. I didn't know how I could manage without them, even if I was somewhat recovered. My brother paid for a lovely service and had them buried out at Spring Hill Gardens. 

&#x200B;

As we left the cemetery, the lamps lining the driveway started to flicker and the radio went berserk. My hands and legs knotted.  I started to hold my breath while a noise tried to escape from my throat. My brother rushed me to an ER three miles away. Everything stopped once we got in the parking lot, but he forced me to get checked out. The doctor's thought stress triggered a relapse. 

&#x200B;

Five years have passed since my brother and I buried our parents. Six months ago I started having heart palpitations. Three months ago I started to feel a pressure in my head. It's like someone, or something, is pressing down hard on my brain. My teeth feel like they are being tightened and my frontal lobe goes from hot to cold. The back of my head feels like it's in a vice. I have use of both of my hands, sometimes. 

&#x200B;

I'm sitting up in a hospital bed. They've given me a laptop to amuse myself. My legs aren't working again. My vision is starting to blur, and my voice is gone. I don't think I'll ever leave this place, I'm too far gone. It's taken me two days just to type this out. 

&#x200B;

My laptop is fading from bright to dark by itself. The radio is changing the stations on its own. Lights are flickering in my room and the hallway has gone dark.  The machines monitoring me are going off, but I don't think the hospital staff is aware. 

&#x200B;

My brain is dough, being kneaded by harsh, unseen hands. My heart feels like it's going to burst out of my chest. I feel something dripping out of my ear. I can only assume it's blood. 

&#x200B;

There's an orange glow in the hallway. I don't know what will happen to me next. With some luck I can finish this before my laptop shuts off. Whatever happens, I hope my brother will be okay.    

&#x200B;

For almost fifteen years I have been poked, prodded, scanned, and examined. Doctors have said words like Tourette's, Dystonia, Lupus, and Epilepsy. The psychologists and nurses are as lost as the neurologists and psychiatrists. They don't know what caused my affliction, but I do.  

&#x200B;

It was the thing in the driveway.

When I first saw the deer, it was a beautiful summer morning. I wasn’t surprised by it at first. It’s not exactly shocking to see deer on a hiking trail. That was until she turned her face. The doe’s eyeball was dangling down, barely attached by muscle and nerve tissue. The sight of it made me stop in my tracks. 


My first instinct was to call animal control, but I knew I would be laughed at for suggesting they help wildlife. My next thought was to  put the poor thing out of her misery. However, I didn’t have a deer license, and this area was too populated to risk shooting in. So I stood there transfixed, listening to the doe’s labored breaths. Heartbroken at my inability to help.


Eventually the deer staggered away. I thought that would be the end of that. It was an awful sight to see, but the brutality of nature is a part of life. Unfortunately for me, I was about to understand this on a whole new level.


It started with an increase of birds around my house. Their chatter woke me at the crack of dawn every single day. Annoying, but dismissible. Then the mice came. I cleaned my house from top to bottom. I searched endlessly for what was attracting them. I even hired an exterminator. Despite all this, they just kept coming and coming. They destroyed my kitchen, my clothes, and even my bed. Not that I had been sleeping in it much. On the first night of their arrival, I woke up to mice crawling on my face.


Next came the deer tracks around my bedroom window and backdoor. I almost didn’t notice them, thanks to how distracted I was with the mice. Though when I did, I immediately knew something was wrong. See, it’s not unusual for deer to raid people’s garden or yards. But when they do, they wonder a bit, or at least make a beeline for the food. These tracks went directly from the woods, to the window, to the door, and then back to the woods again. In my sleep deprived state, I might have been able to cobble together a normal reason why it happened, if not for the depth of the tracks. They were made by something much, much heavier than a deer possibly could be.


That was the final straw. I asked my cousin if I could crash at his place until I got my house in order. He agreed, but I had to stay one more night to pack and board up my house. I know, I know, dumb move. But you got to understand, this little house was my grandmother’s before she died. I couldn’t bear to leave it unprotected. 


I was so close to being done. All that was left was to lock the front door. My truck keys were in one hand. My other hand was on the knob, when I heard a bang and then a screeching sound. As if something heavy was being dragged down the door.


I had had enough. I was being driven out of the house I was raised in. I would not be pushed any farther. So I grabbed my rifle, and threw the door open, hoping to catch whatever the hell was out there by surprise.


The deer with the hanging eye was waiting for me. I wish  I could say that my plan worked, but it happened so fast that I didn’t even have time to pull the trigger. A flash of movement, and then a stab of  pain in my left eye. Before I passed out, I saw double.


When I woke up, I was in a hospital with an eyepatch. I was surrounded by very confused and worried relatives, doctors, and nurses asking how I lost my eye. I lied and said I didn’t remember. What the hell else could I say? 


Unless you want to end up like me, I suggest you take my advice. If you see a deer in the woods, look down and keep on walking. There are things in there looking for you, even if you aren’t looking for them. And trust me, they have no qualms about pulling at your heart strings.

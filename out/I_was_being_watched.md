As of this story I was 14. Growing up I loved to watch,my still favorite YouTuber, MrBallen. I’d watch his videos endlessly on TikTok and YouTube both wheneve the chance came. I would always watch them at night even though I hated to do so. But I thought to myself every night, “it was a challenge.” So that would be what I did when ever he’d post a new video.

With that habit came along fears that people were watching me, that demons were going to haunt me, or that murderers were hiding outside of my house. I had always thought that that was my mind playing tricks against me, as a result of watching the, Strange Dark and Mysterious. 

Although I had this feeling a lot, this time in particular felt different. It was as normal, watching MrBallen on a weekend with no schoolwork in sight. But the Sun had fallen and it was night time. I had noticed something outside of my window on my neighbors rooftop (my bed is flush with my wall and I have to turn my head left to see out of my window) it looked like a figure of some sort, like a man or women it was hard to tell. But almost deformed looking. I had been curious and got a flashlight to see what it was. When I came back it didn’t look like it was there but I shined it anyways. It had just been my neighbors satellite dish so, I shook it off and went to bed. 

This would happen a number of times in the occurring days with me feeling as if watched. So I had taken a break from watching MrBallen thinking it would help with that creepy feeling, but it would not help at all if anything it got worse. 

After about a week from this first “sighting” of this figure I had been sick of it, I was determined to find out what this was. I kept this 500 lumen flashlight, I had for spotlighting, in my room. I kept it in my right hand with a finger on the button for when it showed up. This night had been different from any others it wasn’t showing up at the times it was before, as if it knew I was prepared. It was getting to the point where I was so tired I could barely keep my eyes open. But then around 2-3am I had seen something, flashlight in hand i shined it right toward this figure and what I saw will forever haunt me.

A few weeks ago my neighbors daughter had gone missing. She was last seen roller skating to her house from her friends house after going there for a birthday party. About a week went by and then they go a letter sent by the supposed “killer” that shocked the town. It was an exact description of the murder of my neighbors daughter. Even with the location of the body. With this the cops still couldn’t find her. This could’ve meant two thing, this letter was fake or missing some of the truth. 

But either way the body had not yet been found, until now the “figure” on my neighbors house was their daughter. Her face was torn up and her body was destroyed, it had looked like the killer had tried to chop her up but failed. I held the flashlight aimed right at the daughter while dialing the police in the other hand. After the call was made the flashlight that I was holding was so bright it was lighting up the lawn aswell as the body, and in my peripheral vision I had seen him, the murderer staring right at me with a mask on that had a huge smile plastered across it. Seconds later police sirens went off scaring away the masked man.

When police had asked me questions I was to shocked to answer. I had been being watched by the killer and my best friend’s corpse for over a week.

I’m not sure I will ever get over this or not but I continue to watch MrBallen to this day because it in a weird way helps.

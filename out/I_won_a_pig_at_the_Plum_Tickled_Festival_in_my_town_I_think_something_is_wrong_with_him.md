The advertisement read: “Greased pig contest! If you can catch it, it’s yours! Think you have what it takes to bring home the bacon?” and underneath the text was a location and contact name. 

At Grant Square at 5 p.m. in the evening, Lucinda Ferril was hosting a greased pig contest for children ages 5-14, and I was 100% going to register. I was walking by on my merry way home after a splendidly boring day at school when I noticed the poster plastered on the wall of the Grant County Courthouse. This week was the annual Plum Tickled Festival in Grant County and everyone was out and about visiting vendors set up on the square and frequenting those food trucks that made southern delicacies with sides of heart attacks and strokes. Buckets of fries piled with cheese sauce and bacon. Deep fried oreos covered in powdered sugar. Potatoes cut into ribbons, deep friend, and smothered with cheese, ranch, and the whole kitchen sink.

I could smell the clogged arteries from here. 

A tall woman knocked into my shoulder as she walked past, blabbering on about the plum tart she entered into a dessert contest the day before to another woman who I guessed was her friend. She didn’t even acknowledge my small frame, and I almost toppled forward into the grass where I was sure I would’ve come up with a skinned knee.

I made the meanest face I could muster behind her back and trudged on to the courthouse square to meet Lucinda Ferril. She was set up just in front of the detention center, selling some homemade trinkets that basically looked like glorified trash. There were some knitted pot holders and handmade jewelry; it all looked like it would fall apart the moment someone touched it, so I looked away before she could try to sell me anything.

She was sitting with her husband Clement, or Clem as everyone called him, and counting a huge stack of $20 bills. She was dressed in this floral jumpsuit, but the legs were too short for her height, so they stopped just at the middle of her calf. She wore caked-on layers of makeup and a lipstick color so dark that it seemed she’d been rubbing blood all over her mouth. Her dark hair was long and greasy, unwashed and unkempt. That was Lucinda Ferril—all glam, but no glitz—you could pick her in a line-up from a mile away. Clem, on the other hand, had his head leaned back, snoring so loudly he could wake the dead. He had on dirty jeans and a dingy wife beater, the epitome of what some would call southern, white trash. 

They were somewhat of legends in Grant County. There were all sorts of rumors about them having a puppy mill or being backyard breeders. There were always calls to the police about reports of animal abuse, but really, nothing ever came of them. They were just rumors after all.

I started to introduce myself, but Lucinda noticed me standing there before I could speak.

“Whaddya want, kid?” She asked crudely, jutting out her bottom lip to reveal a layer of lipstick on the inner part of her mouth. I could only imagine what her teeth looked like. 

“Mrs. Ferril,” I said with a squeak, and I cleared my throat, hoping to sound less nervous. “I was wantin’ to enter the greased pig contest. I saw where I had to sign up with you.”

She gave me a once over, dark eyes trailing down my body. I know I must’ve looked extra small since I was wearing my two-sizes-too-big overalls and gigantic work boots. She let out a hearty chuckle, but it turned into a wheezing cough. 

“You blip of a thing?” She asked between fits of laughter and coughing. “I’ll bet ya don’t weigh 80 pounds soakin’ wet.”

Truth was, I was a small kid, and for some reason, no one could ever let me forget it.

“Yes’m,” I said, unwavering. “I’d like to sign up please, ma’am.”

She gave me an incredulous look and the foundation in the corners of her eyes separated and pilled off in small pieces, tumbling down her face. She looked like she was made of clay. 

“Allright.”

She reached behind her, rummaging through a large duffel bag, and pulled out a clipboard and pen. “Sign your name and age. That’ll be $50” she said, gruffly. “But just know, them other kids is gunna eat you alive.”

I nodded, signed my name, listed my age, gave her the cash, and gave her back the clipboard, never once letting her know her words were affecting me more than they should.

“Don’t come outta that ring cryin’ when you don’t hook that pig because I warned ya.”

I gave her one last look and nodded, deciding now would be the best time to walk away and head toward the makeshift area set up on the square. As I did though, she yelled in my direction.

“Competition starts in 15 minutes! Git yer ass up there!”

I hightailed it up there as quickly as I could, hoping I wouldn’t fall climbing up the hill.

——

The little makeshift arena was just a small fenced area surrounding a plot of dirt. Inside were five plump piglets, one for each age group. They were laying in a pile clumped together, breathing heavy from the heat bearing down on them. The sun was high in the sky, and there wasn’t a cloud in sight. The longer we all stood there crowded around the small pen, the hotter it got. I could feel the back of my neck burning, and I wished I’d have remembered to put on sunscreen earlier. 

The competition went by quickly. A handler would take one pig, lather it in vegetable oil, and let it go inside a pen of children. First up were the five and six year olds. It was like watching a flock of chickens chase down the pig. Little hands would grab at the pig, but it would be too slippery to get a good hold, and someone would end up falling and hurting themselves, ending in a crying fit. The seven and eight year olds were a little better, but when the nine and ten year olds jumped into the pen, things started to get a little more violent.

There were hordes of kids chasing after one piglet, hoping they could take home a new pet. Once one kid grabbed the pig, the other would pile on top, essentially crushing the poor animal. It would squeal and squeal to no end. I sort of felt sorry for them, and I vowed to keep the pig as a pet if I won it—there would be no bacon or pork chops for me. 

Finally, it was the eleven and twelve year old groups' turn and I hopped over the fence, landing with a thud flat on my feet. I watched as the handler, hands dark with mud and dirt, grabbed the next to last pig, and poured oil on it from head to toe. It squealed in discomfort. 

I was going up against some pretty stiff competition. Boys so big they would definitely play football in highschool. Girls so tall they had a volleyball career in their future. I knew everyone would be tough to beat. 

As the handler brought the pig into the pen, I drew in a deep breath, letting it out as Lucinda Ferril started her countdown.

The whistle blew and I was quick on my feet. The pig went to the left and a boy with moppy blonde hair threw himself into a tackle to grab the pigs back legs, to no avail. He twisted onto his back, clutching at his arm with a pained look on his face. 

I tried to beat the pig to the head of the gate, making a wide circle in the other direction. A line of kids was trailing behind. More and more of them tried to jump into a tackle, but they soon found out that tactic didn’t work. I did my best to get the upper hand—matching the pig at a steady pace. We were all covered in mud and dirt and sweat and we were sure no one was going to catch the pig; it was too quick and slick.

Until I saw an opening.

A couple of boys had the pig cornered with their legs spread in a catcher stance. I took my chance and dove between a crowd of legs, (thank God for my small frame), and grasped the pig by its back legs. The thing squealed and wriggled in my hands, but I had a vice grip on it—I was not letting go. 

Time was called by the handler and it was only then that I let go of the pig. I had won— the pig was mine!

I lifted myself up out of the dirt and brushed off my overalls. Sweat was dripping down my back, but that didn’t matter. I had beat all these other kids in catching this pig. For once in my life, I was better than them. I was a winner. 

We were all rushed out of the pen so they could hurry up with the last group of kids. I was high on adrenaline. My heart was pumping and I was shaking, and I couldn’t help a smile from plastering on my face. When I went to collect my medal from Lucinda, she couldn’t believe her eyes. 

“I guess a blind squirrel finds a nut once in a while.”

I gladly took the medal from her, but I had to wait to collect my pig after the whole thing was over.

I couldn’t stop smiling.

——

They gave me the pig with a rope tied around its middle, so that I could walk it home. Actually, it was more like drag. The thing did not want to go with me no matter how hard I tried to coax it; I gave it blueberries, which it really liked at the beginning, but started rejecting them after a little while. 

Eventually, I got it home, and I let it loose in the fence with the goats, hoping it could make friends with them. We didn’t have a separate area for pigs because daddy didn’t raise them like our cows and goats. 

Toast is what I named him; I’d decided on the way home. Because he was that familiar color of brown, where you pull the bread out of the toaster right before it burns. 

I just hoped momma and daddy wouldn’t freak out when I told them I’d won him in a greased pig contest.

——

A few weeks passed and it seemed like Toast was starting to like it at the farm. Momma wasn’t angry that I brought him home, but daddy threatened to take him up the road to the slaughterhouse so we could have some bacon on Sunday morning.

I begged and pleaded with Daddy, told him I loved Toast, and that he was the only thing in the world I was proud of. All I had to do was flash a pouty lip and Daddy was like putty in my hands. 

They let me keep him so long as I was the one who took care of him. No problem there. I went out every morning before school and filled his food trough and got him fresh water. I’d washed the oil off him days ago, but his skin still felt greasy and slick. It would be a while before it wore off. 

The longer he lived with us, the fatter and bigger Toast got. He was now almost the size of a full grown pig. He had floppy ears and always a wet nose. 

One day after school though, I was having a particularly bad day after being ridiculed during gym class, and when I got home, I just wanted to go hug Toast and give him some banana as a treat. He could smell the slices from a mile away and would most usually come stomping in my direction, a look of urgency on his face. 

But this day, I showed up with the bananas, but Toast never came to greet me. I called for him and walked all over the field. He was nowhere to be seen. I started to get nervous, scared even, because I couldn’t find my best friend. Had he gotten out? Had Daddy taken him to the slaughterhouse like he said he would when I brought him home?

I ran to the house, tears streaming down my face, running directly into my mothers arms. 

“What's wrong, Avery, baby?” The smooth, honey-like tone of her voice always soothed me, but today I wasn’t sure anything would work. Toast was missing. 

“T-toast,” I managed to cry out through choked sobs. “H-he’s gone.”

She called Daddy who then begrudgingly went to the field with me to look for Toast. He swore up and down he hadn’t taken him to get slaughtered for meat and that I could check in the deep freeze if I wanted to. I took his word for it. Daddy never told lies. 

So I picked at my dinner worried that Toast was somewhere lost out in the country with no one to care for him. I barely ate, pushed some peas around the plate, shredded the chicken up into little pieces. I went to bed early and cried myself to sleep.

I had a terrible nightmare about Lucinda Ferril and her lipstick stained teeth. Her husband, Clem, held me down while she took a knife and carved little cuts all over my skin. Called me a wisp in the wind, told me no one would miss me when I was gone.

When I jolted awake, the sun was peering in through my window. It looked like a beautiful start to a weekend, but then reality sunk in about Toast and I went back to being sad. 

Days went by and still no sign of Toast. Momma called animal services and Daddy looked for him on our unfenced property using our ATV. Toast had fallen off the face of the Earth. He was gone forever. My best friend of only a few weeks was gone in the blink of an eye. We all chocked it up to someone taking him in the middle of the night; his soul was mostly likely floating in a jar of bacon grease now.

I couldn’t bear the thought. 

One night, though, it was late. Momma and Daddy let me stay up to watch the evening news with them. They had been a little lenient about my chores and other things ever since Toast disappeared. I think they were worried about me hurting myself.

Barry Montgomery was babbling on about a new high school being built in the city when a breaking news story interrupted the regular news casting. 

A picture popped onto the screen of a woman I recognized. The same greasy hair, terrible makeup, and dark lipstick. Except this time she was smiling at the camera. Although, it looked more like a grimace. She was standing next to her husband in the photo.

*Lucinda and Clement Ferril found dead in their home Thursday night*

At first I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. Lucinda and Clement were dead? What happened?

A newscaster I had never seen before started recounting the story.

*“Clement Ferril and wife Lucinda were found dead in their home this Thursday night. Police are looking to investigate a possible homicide. Both Lucinda and Clement have been under police scrutiny in the past months due to anonymous calls tipping the police to animal abuse and negligence. Please be warned, what police found is extremely graphic. Viewer discretion is advised.”*

According to the police report, Lucinda and Clement had hundreds of dogs kept in cages throughout their property. These dogs did not have access to fresh water or food, and most were extremely emaciated or dead. Not only did they have dogs, but Lucinda and Clement had dead cats strung about the place. Their yard was littered with cats, all in various stages of decay. They also had a couple malnourished horses in a barn and some goats who were found tied to a tree so they could only move a few feet around. As the cherry on top, police found two pigs, one male and the other female, trapped in a shed next to the house. It looked like Lucinda had been breeding the pigs to profit off the greased pig contest she held in town. She would take the piglets from the litter and charge people $50 just to enter a dumb competition to win a pig.

Every animal they found alive was taken to a nearby veterinarian for evaluation. The news report never mentioned how Lucinda and Clement were murdered though. Eventually, a rumor started going around town that some neighbor got tired of seeing the abuse from afar and the police not doing anything about it and decided to take matters into his own hands.

Whether the rumor was true or not, I was glad Lucinda and Clement were dead. Anyone who treated animals in such a terrible way deserved the absolute worst. 

I thought about Toast and was glad I was the one who had won him and not someone else. I hoped wherever he was, he was happier.

——

The next day when I got home from school, I noticed something was a little different. The goat pen gate was open a tad too wide, like something had been trying to get it out. I faulted it on the goats because they were always up to no good. As soon as I went to close the gate though, something caught the attention out of the corner of my eye. 

I glanced over, thinking it was probably just a goat coming to greet me, but instead I saw Toast, chewing on a clump of weeds in the ground.

My heart sang. I could feel my face light up. Without thinking, I jumped over the fence and ran to him, wrapping my arms around him as tightly as I could. He had grown even more since the last time I saw him.

“Toast!” I said, tears streaming down my face. “Where have you been?”

He nuzzled me in the side with his nose, letting out a quick snort. I chuckled, glad to have my pig back. I stepped back a little to look at him because I couldn’t believe my eyes. He must’ve gotten out of the pen and ran away, but somehow found his way back home. I always heard pigs were smart, but I just didn’t believe it until now.

I rubbed my hand down his back while I looked at him. Nothing had changed except the fact that he got a little fatter, but he was a pig, and that was okay. I squatted down to eye level.

“I missed you so much, boy,” I said, patting the top of his head.

He continued to chew on something in his mouth. Something strange and sinewy was hanging out the side. The sky was turning to dusk so it was hard to make out anything. I moved to grab it, but he quickly turned his head to the side.

“Toast, buddy, it’s just me,” I said, rubbing his shoulder, hoping my voice would help relax him. 

He turned back, looking me straight in the eyes. I went to grab at the thing hanging out of his mouth and pulled. Whatever it was, it was dark and long. I looked at it closely and a shiver traveled up my spine, sending a pattern of goosebumps all over my body.

Toast had been chewing on something strange alright.

What I found in his mouth was a clump of hair. Dark and long. But the thing that stood out most to me was that it was extra greasy hair, shiny, like it hadn’t been washed in days. 

Just like Lucinda Ferril’s.

Removed story

Your post has been removed from r/nosleep. Stories must be believable within reason. This means that the narrator must be physically and mentally capable of posting, and that the events of the story cannot be proven to be false on a large scale.

Hi – thanks for the information. Can you explain to me how my story is rule-breaking? The narrator lives, is capable of posting despite the described trauma, and it cannot be disproved by looking outside or reading a newspaper. What element needs to be changed? I’m eager to get it re-approved as soon as possible. Thank you for your assistance in this issue.

The story lacks believability because you claim that the intruder climbs through a window on the second floor. This contradicts the fact that you clearly live in a single-story ranch-style home.

**[–] to /r/nosleep [M] sent 1 hour ago** 

Funny enough, I actually do live in a single-story ranch-style home. I checked the post pretty thoroughly, though, and cannot find any mention of the house. Am I missing something?

**[–] subreddit message via /r/nosleep [M] sent 1 hour ago**  

You’re not missing anything. The story gives a description of the house that is easily disprovable. 

**[–] to /r/nosleep [M] sent 1 hour ago** 

I’m sorry? I think I’m missing something. How is it disprovable?

**[–] subreddit message via /r/nosleep [M] sent 1 hour ago**  

By looking at it.

I’m pretty lost at this point. Are you talking about my actual house? I have to say that this conversation isn’t professional, and I would like to speak with another mod.

**[–] subreddit message via /r/nosleep [M] sent 1 hour ago**  

You’re not lost. You haven’t moved from in front of your computer for the past three hours. And why would you want to speak with someone so far away?

**[–] to /r/nosleep [M] sent 1 hour ago** 

What the hell? Of course everyone’s far away. Reddit users are all over the world. You’re officially creeping me out, and I want to end this conversation. Please connect me with a different mod.

Closing the blinds won’t protect you.

**[–] to /r/nosleep [M] sent 57 minutes ago** 

OK, WHAT THE HELL? How did you know that I closed the blinds? This isn’t funny. I’m asking you to leave me alone.

**[–] subreddit message via /r/nosleep [M] sent 51 minutes ago**  

Why would you suddenly need to be alone after three hours of sharing your home?

**[–] to /r/nosleep [M] sent 46 minutes ago** 

Joke’s on you. I’ve been alone since getting home from work. You were making some lucky guesses in the beginning, but you should have quit when you were ahead.

**[–] subreddit message via /r/nosleep [M] sent 41 minutes ago**  

I don’t play guessing games. You weren’t alone.

**[–] to /r/nosleep [M] sent 38 minutes ago** 

Was that crash in the hallway because of you? How are you doing this? FUCK YOU. I’m calling the cops.

**[–] subreddit message via /r/nosleep [M] sent 34 minutes ago**  

Why would you choose to live in a rural area, fifteen minutes from the nearest police station, if you thought the cops were your only protection?

**[–] to /r/nosleep [M] sent 33 minutes ago** 

I’m done. I’m fucking done.

**[–] subreddit message via /r/nosleep [M] sent 30 minutes ago**  

Yes.

**[–] to /r/nosleep [M] sent 28 minutes ago** 

Congratulations, you pounded on three different windows. You think that you’re scaring me?

**[–] subreddit message via /r/nosleep [M] sent 27 minutes ago**  

Yes.

**[–] to /r/nosleep [M] sent 24 minutes ago** 

I have a shotgun.

**[–] subreddit message via /r/nosleep [M] sent 22 minutes ago**  

I have your shotgun.

**[–] to /r/nosleep [M] sent 19 minutes ago** 

Okay. I checked. Yes, my shotgun is gone. I’m being polite. See? No anger. No malice. You win. I am completely fucking petrified. What will it take for you to leave me alone?

**[–] subreddit message via /r/nosleep [M] sent 13 minutes ago**  

Just give up hope.

**[–] to /r/nosleep [M] sent 1 minute ago** 

That’s it. I don’t know what’s happening, or why my cell phone isn’t getting any reception, or why you’re firing my shotgun in the backyard. But I’m going to let everyone know what happened. You might win this one. But people will know. I will send these messages to everyone I can. Fuck you.

I will keep updating as long as I’m physically capable.

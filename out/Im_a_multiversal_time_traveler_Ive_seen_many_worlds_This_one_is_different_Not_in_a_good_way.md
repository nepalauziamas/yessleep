I am a multiversal timeline traveler. I've come across many dying worlds, many flourishing ones. But nothing has shook me more than this world. What's worse? I feel like I've been here.

There is a primal sense of terror wherever I go. An ancient evil befalls even the slightest mistake, one mistake I cannot afford to make. This feeling falls beyond words, beyond the hand that writes this post. I have no knowledge as to how I am still able to describe my experience to you all. As I deactivate my time-travelling suit and get off my time-surfing board, the desolate sight of a destroyed world greets my eyes.Nothing but bleak grey monotone, a remainder of a catastrophe so great it has removed the color from this world. It reminds me of those old greyscale movies I'd see at the theaters of worlds less advanced than mine. But nothing has haunted me more than this world. The sense of emptiness. The lack of sound doesn't help either. Maybe walking further into this place wouldn't be such a bad idea. I take one step forward. Reality morphs around me, melding and reforging into a swirl of darkness that implodes on itself, like a black hole before it vomits out another image. Another reality. A dark red sky, the color of blood, hangs on barely over the landscape, a semblance of destruction.

"What has happened to this world?"

I barely let out a whisper, as many more echoes surround me, each time getting deeper and deeper in pitch.

"What has happened to this world?"

"What has happened to this world?"

"What has happened to this world?"

It gets deeper, from my normal voice to something less than human. Something uncanny. I couldn't take it. This world knew how to hurt me, in ways I'd never imagined before. Everything here was telling me to get the absolute fuck out. There were more, how do you people on this Earth say it... "red flags"? There were more red flags than I noticed about this world. 

And then I broke.

"Quiet!"

And then the echoes.

"Quiet!"

"Quiet!"

"Quiet!"

No more. I'd only wished for that to stop. I quickly turn my time surfer board on as fast as I can, the ungodly emanation of fear pushing me to get on as I get on. With a small rev, the board flies off into the sky with me on it, desperately trying to break out. As I pierce the sky's unholy mix of crimson and darkness, my head starts to hurt. The voices. The echoes. The memories. Only, they were memories... of lives I could have led. Memories I never had. One of them snuffed out all of the others.

"Go! Don't wait for me! I'll be fine!"

I find myself in another world, this time indistinguishable from reality or imagination, on my familiar board, speeding away from something, someone else behind me. I'm unable to turn back, unable to twist my neck to see what's behind me, as the sight of a distant light in the far off made it seem like a single star in the grand galaxy. My mouth refuses to open. Perhaps out of fear, or out of adrenaline. The fight or flight response. I know this feeling all too well.

"We're nearly there! The light! Let's-"

The human voice is cut off by a scream, a quickly muffled scream as the sound fades away behind me. As the loving warmth of light in this dead world greets my eyes, I turn back. Finally. And then I remember.

There were two of us. Two multiversal time travelers.

I finally wake up from this ungodly revelation, still on my board desperately breaking through the darkness, the only light coming from the built-in lamp in my mask and the flares from my board. A dark, indescribable primal horror looms behind my back, as I desperately pull toggle the board to maximum speed. The sheer speed I'm flying at starts to take its toll on my, nausea and vertigo setting in, seeping through my suit as I start to lose consciousness.

"There you are, you little mistake."

The uncanny inhuman voice of the entity booms behind me, as I feel something grab me. The darkness smothers me and my screams in its sheer volume. It's like helplessly struggling to breathe, that sinking feeling when something heavy is tied to your legs as you try to swim up to reach that sweet air. With what little consciousness I have left, I rip the covering on my watch off. The emergency button was right there, my finger mashing on the button as I feel myself being sent back in time. I close my eyes, waiting for the living abyss to take me.

Only that it doesn't.

I open my eyes, stuck in that same monotone grey world that I was in before this mess all happened. I start a log on my device, as I type in everything I've seen. After all, if anyone's breaking me out, it's you guys. Fucking hell, I've put myself in a time loop. I die either way. I can only postpone this until someone outside interferes and helps me out of this shithole.

So... If you're out there...

Please.

Don't let the dark take me.

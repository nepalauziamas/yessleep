Possible attempted abduction in OKC


In 2019, I had bought my sister and I tickets to see Twenty One Pilots in Oklahoma City. At the time, I was a 20 year old petite woman. I am a super fan of their music, so made my sister pack and be ready to line up at the venue around 2-3 am to get decent spots in the pit. We got there and were greeted by other fans and had a pretty good time. 

I was able to park my car in a lot pretty close to the venue and got away with it until about 5-6am when police/venue management (I can’t remember which?) told us that anyone parked on that lot would be towed if not moved in the next hour. At that time, the venue management had made an actual line clear up to the door. My sister didn’t have her license at the time and we were able to become aquatinted with some of the people in line, so I felt comfortable for her to stay in line while I found somewhere new to park. 

Fast forward to me finding a sonic that was close by and I figured I could get away with free parking. I started the close to a mile walk back to the venue. I then found an alleyway that looked to be one of those nightlife streets that are connected to bars. Since it was broad daylight and I knew I would save time going this route, I wasn’t apprehensive about taking the alleyway back. 

About halfway through the alleyway, I saw a thin man no later than his 40s sitting at one of the bar’s back patios.  When he saw me, he made a joke about a pillow I was carrying (my sister had texted me and asked me to bring one back so she could take a nap before the concert). He then asked me where I was headed, in which I stupidly told him the concert downtown. He asked me if I wanted drugs, in which I replied no. And then asked if he could come with, which I lied and told him it was sold out. This entire exchange I kept walking while he was talking to hopefully shake him off or show no interest in the conversation. 

When I had reached the end of the alley I had a bad feeling that I was being followed so when I turned the corner I quickly jogged to hopefully gain some distance between us if that was the case. Unfortunately I was correct. I remember hearing fast footsteps following behind me and then abruptly stopping when I turned to look behind me. It was almost like a movie where he would rush behind something when I turned, thinking I didn’t see him. 

At this point I panicked and started trying to spot the closest store to me. It was 5:30-6am at this point so anything I did pass was closed plus I was in a suburban area with more apartment buildings than stores. I turned another corner and saw a man was coming out of his home. I hurried up to the man and remember asking him if he could help me because I was scared and felt unsafe because there was someone following me. At this point the scrawny man from the alley had gained on me and was a few feet away from us. The man following me then began telling the guy I was asking for help that I was a liar and “don’t listen her man”. The guy coming out of his home then looked at me and then the creep and told me, “sorry I can’t help you” and proceeded to close this door in my face.

I have never to this day felt so utterly helpless in my life. I turned to the creepy guy and pled with him to please leave me alone. He kept telling me that “I wasn’t going anywhere” and “I wasn’t going to no concert” and a bunch of other threatening comments. 

By some luck, I was able to spot a group of people in Twenty One Pilots merch across the street and sprinted across and started walking next to them. I quickly told them what was happening and if I could walk with them to the venue and they told me yes. I think the creepy man lost interest in me and I saw his walking slowly back in the opposite direction. 

I was able to make it back to the venue fine but immediately broke down upon seeing my sister. I thanked my new acquaintances and called the cops. I was told “he does that a lot and he’s not harmless”. I was told by the venue’s bodyguards that they would walk me to my car after the concert but upon returning to the same spot for them to do so, they weren’t there. To say I was pretty disappointed on how it was handled is an understatement. It still freaks me out to this day how easily I could have been taken or if I’d even be here to tell anyone this story.

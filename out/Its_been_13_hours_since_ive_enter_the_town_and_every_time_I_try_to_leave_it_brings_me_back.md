This all started when I decided to load me and my dog into the car and take a road trip. I had no idea where we were heading just wanted to get out of my town for weekend. As I was driving I my shitty car broke down. It was a gift from my parents for my 16th birthday it was a beater car. My family was never rich so that was the best they could afford for me. The thing lasted almost 10 years but it apparently hit its finals straw. “God damnit.” I said to myself stepping out of the car. The engine had finally blown as the car sputtered out. Unfortunately for me we broke down in the middle of nowhere and now there wasn’t much I could do but walk to get help. I checked my gps and didn’t have many options. The nearest town with a mechanic was 25 miles away, but I noticed something that I hadn’t seen before. It was a very beat up sign for a town just 2 miles away. I decided to walk my dog and I to the closer town hoping we could find someone there to help us. 

As we got into town it looked very worn down. I couldn’t even tell if anyone lived in this town. We wandered around for a bit. From what I gathered there wasn’t much to this town only have 8 buildings, a diner, a school, and a hospital. The other buildings were just houses. The school doors were boarded shut and the building looked like it hadn’t been in use for awhile. Same with the hospital, but the diner looked in almost perfect condition. I decided that was our best best into getting helped so I walked inside my dog trailing behind. The inside looked just as good as the outside but no one was inside to greet us. I walked back outside and as turned around to look at the restaurant again it’s appearance had changed. It looked just like the hospital and school all run down and not in use. I was seriously freaked out now and decided to leave this place. Me and my dog tried to leave but as we got to the exit my visions went dark and I passed out. 

I woke up right next to my dog trying to remember what happened. We both got up and walked to the exit again. Maybe I was just dreaming about trying to leave the first time but as we got to the exit the same thing happened as the first time. Over the next three hours I tried leaving over and over again but I had no luck. The only luck I had at this point was my phone was still working and did have service but when I tried to make a call no matter who it was it went straight to voicemail. As well as when I  tried to use some of the apps on my phone they wouldn’t work. One of the apps that did work was the maps apps. I tried to see where I was on the map but when I looked the area I was in was apparently all woods. Not a single house or anything was to be seen anywhere near the area I was. My mind was racing, what have I gotten myself into. I tried to leave again running to the exit my dog by my side but was met with the same fate as before waking up in the middle of the town. However though the diner from before has been restored back to its pristine condition.

“Fuck it.” I said walking into the restaurant. Something was different though this time, the smell of fresh food lingered in the air and in the corner of the restaurant was a man eating a meal. I hesitated at first but chose to walk over to him. “Excuse me sir.” I said tapping him on the shoulder. I startled him and he jumped up from his seat. “Who the hell are you!” The man exclaimed.” “Woah calm down. I’m sorry to startle you. You are the first person I have seen in hours and I need answers.” “It’s my apologies, I can’t recall the last time i’ve seen someone out here.” The man said. “What is this place?” “It might be best you grab a seat. I got a lot of explaining to do here.” 

I did as the man said letting my dog jump onto a seat next to me then sitting down myself. “Son i’m sorry to have you end up here, but you are shut out of luck I have to say.” “What do you mean are you saying there is no way out?” I asked. “Let me tell you a little about this place. 11 years ago me and my friends set out on a road trip we took the scenic route even though the scenic route was just some farmland. About halfway to our destination our car broke down. We all decided to walk to this town here. When we got here it was all worn down just like it is now and not single person was here. We tried to leave but to no such luck as we all passed out and ended up back in the town. Over the next  couple hours we kept trying and trying but never were we able to make it back to our car.” “Same thing happened to me and my dog we tried to find help and ended up here.” I said. “Well that’s must be how this place gets you in here. Breaking down your car. Having you wander here trying to find help and then trapping you. But anyways my friends and I after trying for so long decided to break into one of the houses. That’s where we stayed for the night. There is something you will come to notice about this place, it’s always night no matter what.” The man then checked his watch and then looked up and me and said “Oh shit. Follow me now.” He ran out of the building and I followed. We jumped through the back window on his house and ran upstairs. 

I looked out the window and couldn’t believe what I saw.

I got it for her birthday as a surprise present. She'd wanted one for a while but claimed we had no money for it. It was a newer model that hadn't been tested yet, so they were given out for a cheap price.

When I brought it home, my girlfriend was ecstatic. She turned Roomba on to clean the apartment and pranced after it the entire time, scrutinizing its methodical vacuuming.

It became clear soon enough that the Roomba I'd bought had low suction power, which rendered it unable to vacuum the apartment properly. My girlfriend is one of those people who constantly cleans, so it's no wonder that the Roomba didn't live up to her standards.

She put the robot back in the box and tucked it away, choosing to stick to conventional vacuuming. I wasn't angry, to be honest. Whatever made her happier.

Sometime later, she did take the Roomba out and occasionally allowed it to vacuum the bedroom. One day, she came to me and said, "I think the Roomba is trying to kill me."

"What are you talking about?" I asked, trying to hide the skepticism in my tone.

"Whenever I turn it on, it starts chasing after me. I leave it in the bedroom, and the moment I enter, it comes after me."

I scoffed and dismissed her complaint as a joke. When she insisted she wasn't joking, I convinced her that there's no way a vacuuming robot was trying to kill her.

A week later, she took out Roomba again to let it do its thing in the bedroom. A yelp and clatter in the kitchen caught my attention. When I rushed inside to see what was going on, my girlfriend was on the floor, rubbing her bruised foot, the Roomba sitting next to her.

"What happened?" I asked.

"Roomba. It fell on my foot," my girlfriend hissed.

Her foot was swollen. I took her to the bedroom and put ice on her foot. I told her to be careful next time and turned to leave, when she called out to me.

"It wasn't an accident," she said. She must have noticed the disbelief on my face, because she quickly added. "I lifted it to put it back in place, and it just... Detached from the piece I was holding and plopped on my foot."

"Probably a loose piece. Or maybe it's trying to kill you because you rejected it as our family member," I joked, much to her glower.

In the end, I still refused to believe a claim as outlandish as a Roomba trying to kill its host. My girlfriend got really angry at me for a few days.

Then one night, I was jolted awake by a shake on my shoulder. I sat ramrod straight, wondering what universe and century I was in.

My girlfriend was pressed against me, her hand on my shoulder, her eyes fixated at something on her side of the bed.

"What's wrong?" I asked, groggy, my eyelids begging to shut.

She pointed a stiff finger to her side of the bed. I couldn't see anything. That's when I realized she was pointing to the floor.

I crawled to her side of the bed and looked down. There it was, sitting silently on the floor, just next to the bed on my girlfriend's side.

I could practically imagine a pair of robotic eyes staring back at me, the circular rim of the vacuum stretched into a perpetual grin.

My girlfriend was obviously more perturbed than I was. She refused to turn off the lights until I locked Roomba in the storage. Only then was she able to tentatively relax.

For the next few days, she begged me to sell the Roomba or throw it in the trash. I wasn't going to throw it. Those things are expensive. I couldn't sell it, either. Who would buy an untested beta model of a Roomba? Especially a dangerous one like this one? Besides, the money I'd get for it wouldn't be worth the hassle.

I told my girlfriend I'd see what I can do, mostly just to buy myself some time. The robot was locked in the storage anyway, so not like it could hurt anyone.

That's what I thought, at least. I was dead wrong.

One day, I got a call from the hospital. My girlfriend had been in a home accident and had to be hospitalized. I rushed there to see if she was okay.

A fractured rib, a bruised neck, and a twisted ankle. Nothing too serious.

"It was the Roomba," she said through her sobs. "I almost broke my neck."

I held her as she cried, and then I went home. The Roomba was in the locked storage, as if it had never even left it. I picked it up and chucked it in the trash can.

If it can't even kill a person like it was intended to, then what's the point of keeping it?

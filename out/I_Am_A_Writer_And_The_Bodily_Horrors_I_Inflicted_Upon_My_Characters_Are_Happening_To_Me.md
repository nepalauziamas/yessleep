I fear that I may have fucked up. Majorly. 

I piss a lot of people off on the daily so anyone of those seething bastards could be responsible for my current “afflictions”. My guess, the Gray Witch who I had a one night stand with the other night. Gray Witches use both white and black magic and will do whatever it takes to get their “justice”. In this case, she’s mad because I don’t like her back and won’t go on a date with her. I think her name was Melody or something like that. It wouldn’t surprise me if I’m right since there’s a lot of witches in this area who are clingy and petty as fuck.

Oh, mind my bad manners. My name is Henry, I’m twenty-seven years old, and I currently have toenails instead of fingernails on my hands. 

That’s not all folks, but the toenails were just the beginning. Let me explain. 

I am a writer and have been my whole life. By the time I was five, my mom had a huge stack of those badly drawn story books kids would draw on loose pieces of printer paper in a random drawer in her desk. I lost interest for a few years and started to write again after my passion for writing reignited after I first turned seventeen. 

I mainly write in the Horror genre. Mostly short little one time scares, but I’ve written longer series and have a couple of small universes with eclectic horror all throughout them. There isn’t really an explanation for why I just write horror, it’s just what comes naturally for me. I’d like to say that I’m a great writer and my stories are good enough to considered one of the greats one day though.

As you can probably guess, most of my works are posted online. My pen name is Henry’sHorrors (so original I know). I’ve gained a small following throughout the past ten years, but it’s big enough to where I can luckily write full time for my job.

So flashback to two nights ago. I’d been suffering from writer’s block for a week or two so I decided I needed to get out and find some inspiration for my next work. Seeing as I write the weird and macabre for a living, I headed to the occult themed bar in my town where all the freaks hang out to find some fellow weirdos and juice ideas from them. If there’s anywhere to find inspiration for a good horror story, it was there. 

The bar itself is a little hole in the wall joint smushed in between a local Chinese restaurant and a UPS store. There’s a pink florescent sign above the door that reads Ouija Bar. Get it? It’s like ouija board but instead of board it’s bar? Anyway, there’s a planchette graphic on one of the windows with the bars name in the middle of it, so you can really get a vibe of the place. 

The bells above the door jingled as I opened it and found a seat at the bar. The stools were those cool little swivel ones with a dark red leather upholstered on the seat. The walls were brick and the bar had this whole type of look to it. Barracuda by Heart was playing and really added onto the vibe. 

After ordering a beer from the bar tender, I looked around the place to see if I could find some inspiration. There was a couple of Goths in a booth in the back corner. I thought about writing another vampire story when I saw one of the girls had those fang dental implants, but quickly rejected the idea since it was basic and overwritten about. 

There weren’t many people in the bar when I was there, seeing as it was early on a Saturday night and everyone would be coming in later. Besides the flock of Goths, there was an older man who had a mean mug plastered on his face and a younger dude who was on his phone. The younger guy looked more approachable so I decided he would be my next target.

Right before I got up though, a woman walked into the bar and sat right next to me. She ordered a shot of tequila and I took a sip of my beer and side eyed her. She wasn’t a ten by all means, but she was pretty. A solid six or seven I’d say. She had tan skin and long wavy black hair with matching green eyes. She wore a tight fitting black dress that hugged her small curves nicely. 

She’s the one who initiated the conversation first, not me. She asked me why I was there and I informed her of my writer’s block. She seemed pretty interested in my dilemma, introduced herself, and then told me about how she was a Gray Witch. 

I’ve been to the Ouija Bar many a time before that night and I’ve met plenty of witches and other interesting characters (like those who believe they are actually vampires and werewolves). Mostly the witches I meet are Wiccan but I’ve met a few Hedge Witches and even some who were part of the local coven. Do I think some of them actually wielded magic? Maybe. I’ve always thought there was the possibility of magic being real, and after my experience with Melody, yeah it definitely is because there’s no rational reason to explain what’s happening to me. 

After talking with Melody for a bit and finding out more about Gray Witches, I decided that’s what I would write about next. The characters and plot for the story slowly started to form in the back of my brain. The story’s development was halted after more alcohol entered my system and we talked more. Eventually we left the Ouija Bar and went to her place. We had some fun, it wasn’t the greatest but it was better than nothing, and talked a bit more before going to sleep. I talked about my writing and her about her witchcraft. 

I woke up before her on Sunday morning and silently made my escape. Besides being a witch, there wasn’t anything interesting about her. All she did was run an herbal shop and make potions and cast spells and stuff for her clients. Typical boring witch stuff. Her place wasn’t too far of a walk from my apartment complex but I didn’t feel like walking so I took an Uber home. 

Checking my phone after taking a hangover nap, I discovered a text message from an unknown number:

I had fun last night, but was sad to see you weren’t there when I woke up!! Wanna grab a coffee or dinner tonight in order to make it up to me? ;)

I sighed as I rubbed my temples. I was mulling over how to gently let Melody know I wasn’t interested in her. Then I realized I never gave her my number to begin with. After brushing off the uneasy feeling, I eventually responded with:

Hi Melody, how did you get my number? Anyway, I’m sorry but I’m not interested in having a relationship with you. Goodbye. 

I left my phone on my bed as I went to brew myself a pot of coffee. My heart dropped when I returned to my bedroom. There was an angry text from Melody awaiting for me:

First of all fuck you, my name is Marney. Secondly, I unlocked your phone while you were sleeping last night. And remember, I’m a witch you dumbass. I’m going to make you regret ever said no to me. 

After reading the ominously threatening text, I simply blocked Melody’s- I mean Marney’s- number, not thinking much about it. I didn’t really think she could do anything to me with her witchy stuff back then, but I was wrong. 

Nothing happened for the rest of Sunday. I wrote the witch story- a girl got kidnapped by a coven of Gray Witches and was coerced into joining them with a fucked up initiation ritual where she brutally decimated her best friend- and posted it. I patiently refreshed the page constantly, waiting to read the comments, and then went to bed. Monday, yesterday, morning I woke up and felt a little off, but couldn’t place it. 

It takes me like an hour to fully wake up in the mornings so I didn’t notice anything until I went on my phone to check how my story was doing on the forum I posted it on. It was a subtle difference but a difference none the less. My fingernails were… different. For one they were longer than they had been when I went to bed. They were thicker, harder, and a bit heavier too. Worst of all, the smelled a little like feet. I thought I was hallucinating at first and went to the bathroom and scrubbed my hands clean, making sure to definitely get under the nail. After rubbing my eyes and staring at my hands, nothing changed and the stink of feet still lingered. 

Denial, that is the first stage of the grieving process. I was in denial that morning. Even if every single one of my nails felt foreign and uncomfortable, even if every time I looked down they seemed to be just a little longer, even if the nails seemed to get a little bit sharper, I was in denial. 

You see, in the back of my mind, I knew what was going on as I’d written a story where the main character’s fingernails were replaced with toenails. 

One thing you should know about me is that, although I write stories in all the different sub genres of horror, bodily horror is one of my favorites. I absolutely love the classics like “Wasp Woman” and “The Fly”. 

This fact I unfortunately divulged to Melody, or Marney, or whatever her name is. I told her about some of the different body horror stories I’ve written and even told her the name of my website and subreddit where I post all the stories I’ve written. 

Something compelled me to hop on my computer and reread the story “Our Game of Would You Rather Wasn’t Supposed to End Like This.” I had written it a few months ago after watching a YouTube video where they talked about the game. 

Essentially this kid, Ethan, and his best friend, Nathan, play the game would you rather. Nathan had asked Ethan this dumb question like would you rather have toenails instead of fingernails or hair instead of teeth? Ethan picked the former and then asked, would you rather die a horrible and painful death and become a ghost or have sex with your sister? Obviously Nathan picked death. It was supposed to be a crude joke between them and the two thought nothing of their little game and went on with their lives, until the next day when Ethan woke up with uncuttable, long, and sharp toenails in place of his fingernails and Nathans body was brutally mangled in a car accident. 

My heart sunk after I finished reading my post. I then grabbed the nail clippers from my nightstand and attempted to cut the nail on my thumb. My metallic fucking nail clippers broke and the reality had sunken in. I had toenails instead of fingernails.

I remember thinking at least it wasn’t what happened to Nathan, but then quickly retracted the thought out of fear of jinxing myself.

The toenail thing was the least of my worries compared to what was to come. Just a minor inconvenience. 

Around four in the afternoon was when my minor inconvenience turned into more of a problem. I had been sulking in my bedroom as one would do in my predicament. My eyes had grown heavy after silently crying to myself for a few hours. I was on the cusp of passing out when a sudden and sharp pain erupted from my spine. A loud yelp escaped my mouth as I jumped up in my bed. Another burst of white burning pain had me on the floor. 

After recuperating from the fall, I hurriedly got up and ran to the body length mirror that stood in the corner of my room. The pain was traveling all up and down my spine, but it was mainly centered on my lower back, where my tailbone was located. I lifted the back of my shirt and dropped my pants a little to assess the damage. Right above my butt crack was a small circular lump. It was extremely sensitive to the touch and I immediately regretted all my life’s decisions when I gingerly touched the thing. I crumbled to ground in pain, and I also knew which story this was from.

“Laura’s Tail” I named it. A story about a teenage girl who was cursed into turning into the very thing she hated, a cat, after murdering a kitten who was actually a witches familiar. The transformation was slow, painful, and started with a tail. After the transformation was done, Laura was forced to be the witches new familiar. 

I laid on the hard wood flooring for over an hour as I slowly watched the tail form out of my back. The little lump stretched farther and farther out until the skin holding it back snapped wide open and bone grew out of it. Excruciating pain enveloped my lower back as new nerves and muscles formed from the tail, but no matter how much it burned and felt like my spine was getting cut in half, my body refused to grant me the luxury of unconsciousness. At some point I managed to get up and pop in a few painkillers before returning to my bed to feel more comfortable as one can be while growing a tail. Skin and then fur formed on the thing after the new appendage had grown to its desired length. Eventually the pain dissipated and I felt as normal as a guy with toenails for fingernails and a tail could feel. 

I was horrified but also a bit excited as I examined my tail. The fur was grey and a little patch of fur spread from it onto my back. The new muscles felt weird as I willed the thing to move and it waved back and forth. I gingerly touched it and was relieved to know it was less sensitive than earlier. The fur was soft, silky, and fuzzy. The appendage itself went down to the top of my calves so it was a decent length. I brought my sweatpants up and pulled my shirt down before the idea popped into my head. Walking back to my bed, I noticed my balance was different than before. 

I grabbed my phone and went to search for Marney’s number to unblock her and beg her to stop this before I turned into an actual cat, but she blocked me back and I couldn’t contact her. I never got her last name and couldn’t remember the name of her herb shop or where it was. Going outside at the moment wasn’t even in the realm of possibility since you know, I had a tail now. It was still sensitive and I’m not going to shove it in one of my pant legs and be uncomfortable. I decided my best option for now was to scour social media until Marney was found. 

Feeling uncomfortable with where my sweatpants rested on my hips, I ended up cutting a hole in my underwear and pants for the tail to fit through comfortably. After, I meandered my way back to my computer desk to find Melody. Figuring out how to sit down comfortably with the tail was a whole task in and of itself. 

As I scrolled through the countless Marney profiles on Instagram, paranoia crept and crawled in the back of my mind. I didn’t know when another part of my body would change next. If I remembered correctly, Laura’s hands turned into paws next. Hopefully if that did happen the toenail fingernails would go away. My left thumb had an ingrown toenail and it was starting to hurt really bad and annoy me even more. The stench of feet coming off my hands didn’t help either. Most of all I prayed this is all that Melody would do to me, hoping she had already got off on torturing me and would leave me alone now. 

My prayers had gone unanswered and I was sorely mistaken.

I’m a bit ashamed of what happened to me next, but you should know I was actually commissioned into writing this next story. The person payed very well and hey, who am I to kink shame? But, I ended up regretting ever accepting the commission in the first place and became disappointed in myself and in the weirdness of humanity. 

I had started to get a little warm and overall uncomfortable after sitting at my computer for a while. My shirt and pants had started to irritate my skin. I decided it was time for a water break and stood up to stretch. My body felt a little heavier but I chalked it up to my mental stress at the moment. There it is again, denial.

I couldn’t deny it any longer when I passed by the mirror again. I had gained a considerable amount of weight. 

I facepalmed when I remembered taking those pain pills earlier.

The person had reached out to me online and gave me the plot and character names, all I had to do was write. I cringed while reading their message but when I saw how much they were offering, I threw logic out the window.

They called it “Obesity Pills” and the premise of the story was based on a vengeful ex. The main character, Frank, was a recently divorced man who had grown to dislike his wife after she gained some weight. He divorced her over it and he thought that was it, but no. She was a chemist and developed a pill that would start rapid weight gain in the individual who took the pill. She broke into his house and swapped in the obesity pills for his ibuprofen. 

It started off slow, like in the story, but it’s like as soon as I recognized what was going on, my body reacted. The reason my shirt and pants were irritating my skin is because I was growing bigger and the fabric had begun to dig into me. 

I stared in the mirror as my stomach expanded rapidly. My hands grew thicker and the fat traveled up my arms. My shirt exploded off my body once I grew man boobs. They were growing as big as my belly. The thigh area on my pants were next as my hips, thighs, and butt expanded. In a matter of a minute my breathing grew heavy as all of this new weight clung onto my body. I hated the large, naked, fat, blob that looked back at me in the mirror. Coupled with the tail, I looked like one of those furry Chads that spend all their time grooming kids on discord. With the feet smell emanating off my hands, I probably smelled like one too.

The worst part was that I kept getting bigger and bigger. It wasn’t stopping. My skin stretched to its limits as the fat multiplied through out my body. I could feel it weighing down on my cheeks as it spread to my face. It felt like I was going to implode any minute. My stomach and chest area grew the most and the apartment building shook in its foundation as my body lost balance and I tumbled to the ground. The floorboards creaked and moaned under my increasing weight and I feared it wouldn’t be long until it gave way and I crushed the people living under me. The last thing I saw before passing out from lack of oxygen intake was my ever expanding body.

I was surprised when I woke up this morning. Relived is an understatement. I was back to my old weight before I ballooned up, however, I was disconcerted when I noticed the tail that still hung from my back and the toenails on my hands, but hey at least I wasn’t morbidly obese anymore. 

I picked myself up and took a shower. You’d be surprised how heavy a wet tail is, let me tell you that. I didn’t care anymore though since I believed my body was slowly but surely reverting back to normal. I dried myself off, got dressed, brewed some coffee, and made myself a large breakfast. Who knew rapidly expanding would make a guy so hungry?

After eating I checked the comments on my last story post, which was doing fairly well, and responded to people. 

I then understood why Marney stopped from killing me last night. It was the tenderness in my chest and the hunger in my stomach that alerted me.

Do you remember how I said my interest in writing was sparked again when I turned seventeen? Well, I had just watched the Predator movies and had recently read a weird nosleep post about a man getting pregnant, which thus inspired me to write “Something is Growing in My Stomach.”

It’s about a man who is lured and kidnapped into an occult ritual where he is then impregnated with a demonic monster baby then released into the world where he would give birth to it.

After devouring my pantry and having a good cry session, I knew I had to write down my experience because the main character didn’t make it in the end of that story.

The only difference between me and the story is that the demon baby gestated for only a few days. When I started writing this my boobs had already gotten bigger and I was starting to show already. Now that I’m almost done, the thing has grown and my stomach and hips have widened. I look nine months pregnant and then some.

I can feel I’m about to pop, but I don’t know how I’m going to birth it. What I do know is that it’s coming soon, and I’m going to be a mother.

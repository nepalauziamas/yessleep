
			THE ARTEFACT

Twenty-five kilometres North-West of Madagascar, under the guidance of Triskele – a privately held operation, that had set up the world’s first successful deep ocean mining project harvesting manganese, cobalt, and copper. It was a project that became the most ethical, and sustainable mining project around, but before we go any further, I would like to say I have heard the comments that must be spinning in your mind, but a frequent point I would bring up is have you heard of Ituri? North Kivu? Or in the most simplistic sense, do you understand phones, or that hip hybrid vehicle of yours, true place of origin? Not the sleek designs, but rather the components properties, the sweet blends like coffee that warm you up to the delusion your somehow ecologically sound. I won’t pretend as if any mistakes haven’t been made. The lives lost at the Bay of Guinea were terrible, and maybe if the Guinean leaders had cared for people, as much as the luxury of sending their kids to Europe, things might be different. 

There is one thing that had pulled me from the rampant anger you might guess from the earlier paragraph, and I can still recall that form as she swept into my office that day. Dr. Ntsay was her name, and she was an immense presence, especially around her peers and superiors. She was someone you either had to love or loved to hate, with how she dominated a room. I the simple head researcher of this retrofitted oil rig, had the pleasure to know her and love her. It was dinner night, and we had planned on preparing some of the freshly harvested fish we had traded with an ocean tug, that would pass on the periphery of the site, as our daily rations had not brought in the level of comfort food as the fresh tuna would, especially when complimented with the cloves, thyme, and lemon zest that had also been traded for a small distributive fee. 

‘So, shall we leave?’, Ntsay asked.
‘Let me wrap up this report.’, I said.
‘How are you ladies? Date night? I have plans too.’, Stehr quipped.

Ntsay sighed, as she attempted to explain to Stehr that his bravado was pointless with some lesbians in the room. The pale, and bony man in charge of security was seemingly incapable of turning off his chauvinistic charm as he continued his parade around. His arrogance was a guidebook for most of his interactions with the outside world, and it would only become a bigger problem, as a last minute emergency was reported to my office. The boy who cried wolf had not done much to convince me the situations true emergency, as what had usually happened in these ‘emergencies’ was the tree-lovers across most of the departments had a habit of getting agitated when an uncatalogued species of some translucent whale, squid, or goose swam nearby the drilling stations, and they had wished to preserve it, knowing full well the time, money, and lost revenue could handle most African state debt, but the young man had been quick to retort that it had been a true emergency that had summoned me.

‘You’re going to need my help.’, Stehr said.
‘We will call on you, once a boat needs to be sent to pick up the shredded squids.’, Ntsay said.
‘You can laugh, but you both need a man around.’
‘And you need vitamin pills.’, I said.
‘This is my natural body form, you know I take my diet seriously.’


I urged the two to shut up, as we made our way onto the submersible platform we used to send repair crews, to handle the drilling rakes. We would be met by a task force that had been formed to address the item, the young man called nothing more then a thing. It seemed like the usual ecological fearmongering to me, there was a rack of PESU suits to my left, and the scientific task force had been huddled into the corner of the right of the room, looking out through the framed window, almost hoping to catch a sight out of the ‘thing’ through the tricarbonite glass that we were neatly wrapped in. One of them looked over us, and immediately pulled Ntsay into their circle, as Stehr went ahead and took control of the platform’s steering from the platform operator, leaving me all alone, and without a briefing from a group that ended by night plans. 

‘Here we go.’, Stehr announced.

The long pulley made from highly strung out carbon strings had propelled us lower, and lower through the mono-rail as we gently pushed through the sea smog composed from the limestone, and shale deposits that had been grounded down into smooth dust, as it permeated across the waters surface, but as the giant clouds dissipated, we were met by the sight of heavily damaged mulit-billion dollar equipment carved into smooth knobs.

‘Who messed up?’, I asked.
‘No one, it hit something.’, A researcher said.
‘It tears diamond to dust, what can do that?’,
‘Maybe it just wasn’t that good.’, Stehr quipped.

It was just humour to Stehr, and he made no effort to conceal his laxed attitude towards the situation, that could leave us and Triskele completely bankrupt. In fact Stehr had taken the time to talk up the young lady from the Geological department, as she inspected the short range probe the team had deployed, once they had discovered the newly titled, ‘Artefact’, from an engineering warning message after the drills registered damage. I ordered A much larger fifty metre class probe to be sent out, as we were immediately struck by a tide – propelled by the ocean currents, the silts of limestone, and shale would brush up against anything in its way, but as the pelts of grounded stone had brushed against us, the silhouette of something in tide had begun to emerge like a mirage. It was enough to finally calm Stehr, as he was also left speechless by what we saw.

Enveloped in a jagged surface; a few kilometres wide as most of it remained submerged into the sea floor. The machines had after all managed to brush the dust out of it before their bristles had been left worn out. Its cylinder shape had further left us intrigued, but it had been the realisation through the short range probe sent by the geologist that left us stunned. It was completely hollowed out, and quiet possibly by design. The rail that had leashed us onto the rig, had given a slight shake, as the team wondered in such an ominous occasion, weather the cause could be from the Artefact, but Stehr had been quick to remind us all that it was in fact the little coughs the motor made all the way up from the rig.

‘Its not the time to go insane. Is it?’, Stehr said.
‘How long is it?’, I asked.
‘We estimated a couple of kilometres.’, a research explained
‘Man made?’, Stehr had asked.
‘It isn’t a natural feature.’, A researcher slyly answered.

I had heard enough, as I explained they all ought to shut up & let me think through on the next steps. Yet, nothing could come to my mind as I stared vacuum-less across the ridges at the ocean floor formed by our machines, but it seemed now we were confronted with an even greater one. As we pushed closer, & with my own silence holding the teams back. Stehr took the initiative for the deployment of a small team to look more closely at it. He took his assistant aside, and gave an order for his brashful team to carry out his will. The chatter among the group slowly rose as Stehr pushed for me to hand over command of a team to him. I admit that the situation had overtaken me, but who wouldn’t be? Ntsay had long huddled with the technical teams to surmise what statements they could make with the information they had about the ‘Artefact’, as I was again left to pretend like I had an idea of what I was doing. 

‘Sure go ahead, Stehr. Just watch out.’
‘I will.’, 

Stehr assembled his team, and headed over to the deployment room, at the corner of the platform, as the group entered into their PESU suits, which were ten centimetre thick ceramic materials, that had been added onto the already burdensome layer of synthetic fish skin that functioned to provide most of the suits mobility by functioning as muscles. The PESU were not loved, but respected for what the could perform, something made clear with one of their components. A hundred kilogram artificial gill that had operated by inserting sharp needles into the abdominal cavity.

Stehr cracked some jokes through the intercom, as he attempted to push thorough the excruciating piercing that was accompanied with the mild anaesthetic that poured into their bodies, as the PESU’s would launch an integration factor. It would be soon after, that I received news that the 50meter class of probes had been shot out from the rig, and would be converging with Stehr’s team as they explored the artefact. I still feel, as I had at that time that it was risky for a team to be sent out, but for as tacky I found Stehr at times, he was capable.

‘You should opt to use the fifty-metre classes to handle most of the up close inspections.’, I said.
‘I think the tactile feel, might be more beneficial.’, Stehr said.
‘Bullshit, you want to play Rayleigh.’, Ntsay said.
‘Go out in the field, as much as I do, then I might reconsider your position.’, Stehr said.
‘Stehr, we don’t know a lot, and I can’t promise I can help if something goes wrong.’

Stehr brushed us aside, as I talked further with Ntsay about the possible worst case scenario with the team not making it out. Ntsay had felt adamant we had to inform the board, and Malagasy government about what had happened, while I felt as if we still had very little to say but the most insane thing imaginable, at that point it would do little good to put people in a frenzy.

‘Its my home we’re talking about.’, Ntsay said.
‘I know, and it matters to me, nearly as much as it does to you.’, I explained
‘You will have to do more then just say that. Putting Stehr there, wasn’t the most rational decision.’
‘I understand you might not agree with my methods, but I’m still your superior.’

I tried to stop myself, but it was too late, and I had swung it wide and far. Dr. Ntsay chuckled with anger, and continued on with her duties, as my punishment would come in no cuddle time. I finally took a seat down, as the next emergency had come in through the form of the newly uncovered emission waves, and after that it had been that someone had decided to take charge of a fifty-metre probe and navigate it through the cylinder. Stehr couldn’t be reached, and his number two, had been almost stuck in the child-state non-snitching policy, that left her unable to specify exactly what occurred, but it was clear by then, that Stehr had stirred up something.

Communication channels would soon go erratic, as the platform’s cabled probe had slowly become the only source of transmission from the artefact, as ‘it’ or maybe ‘they’ had seemed to have been awoken, and its emission of a strange signal had disrupted all of our communication. 

Ntsay ordered the probe move over to the last known location for the team, as on another panel our sonar had picked up a fifty-metre probe heading into our direction. The feed which had been an amalgamation of infra-red, and ultrasonic imaging, had provided us with the reality of mass death. The suits hunkered onto the ocean floor had been almost squashed down, by some type of force. It was heartbreaking, and fear striking as a few had began to cry for the friends they had lost, and as I had been struck by the desolation enough that I remained unable to act, leaving Ntsay to quickly order for the fifty-metre class probe to be identified. The team picked up to signatures, but also the strain the craft had been operating under, almost as if it was fighting to keep its self up, as we were soon to be affected by the tragedy that occurred to our crew. 

It was unnatural what would soon occur, as the counterweights, levers, and cordage that held the platform were put under a tremendous strain. I reacted with the only way I knew how to, and demanded that the team start pulling the platform up.

‘Up now!’, I shouted out.
‘The others from the probe?’
‘Stay with them, if you want to die.

It had seemed Stehr had the same ideas as he used the platforms monorail system to boost himself, and the platform up against the immense force. Ntsay had panicked, but it was one more concerned that we had likely experienced a localised increased in gravity, a rod in the ocean floor had the capacity to simply pull us down with ease into our deaths, and it contributed to the growing sense of unease about the artefact.

I was the one blamed in the decision to leave the remains at the bottom. It had been twelve hours of surreal horror since we made it back safely to the rig, as teams had begun pushing twelve hour shifts dedicated to rapid experiments, and trying to figure out what we were dealing with. I remained adamant about leaving off-site communication off, until we had enough data, and Ntsay had gotten upset enough to lambast me about the possibility of the gravity waves expanding onto land into Antananarivo, and possibly further into the mainland into Pemba, Arusha, Bulawayo, or Johannesburg. I understood the fear she had come from, but I just could not stop the sense of gut betrayal for being humiliated like that and it deeply hurt. Stehr dealing with decompression sickness had recovered quickly, and had for the most part changed from the experience. He wanted to get back to it, he wanted to find away to get even, and he felt like a fool for getting his team down like that in the first place. We counselled each other with our problems with a bottle of whisky, and left in ten minutes, as our breaks had been over.

We walked our separate ways in the maze like terrain of the converted rig – its former pipelines had been reshaped, and cut to provide the stylistic façade that at times had left you claustrophobic, or somewhat like a super-villian, but it still managed to maintain a charm with the detailed hydroponically grown fauna that for the most part covered most of the ‘unpleasant’ parts, which was ironic for a former petroleum plant, turned deep sea metal mining operation.

Heading back to my office, the Geology head in an untold exuberance had nearly pushed me to the floor, and informed me of the preliminary tests that estimated the artefact as being over twenty billion years old, as metallurgy had also found out about mostly unknown compounds, or even a few elements coming from the shell of the artefact. While his department had stumbled upon a few significant things, ecology had also sent him over to explain the discovery they had made that would likely complicate the situation further, as the small radius of five kilometres around the artefact had began producing significant mutations in plants, sea animals, algae, insects, and even recovered bacterial samples. The radiation had been non cancerous, but had clearly changed the biological patterns of the effected species, and one great white shark had produced some strange features that they would have liked for me to see.

He guided me over to the ecology, as he ranted on about the genuine mystery, and intrigue of the artefact as I did my best to maintain a cool about a scenario that felt more like fruition of an apocalypse. Once we arrived, we heard the ramblings as it seemed as if a crowd had gathered to witness a hanging, pushing those faces of fear, disgust, and confusion aside we found the lab had been painted over with traces of a purple goo, left splattered on the team that had been left in a state of shock. As I tried to understand their reactions as I headed closer to the glass panes that split the lab, and the outside world, the scene was composed of the former shell of the shark, cocooned with a thick white film, and a few metres from it was the strange corpse, with the team a fair distance away from it. Whatever it had been, and what had caused the clear bash on it skull had to be solved by internal; but the situation had clearly been caused by the heightening stress levels. 

The cocoon structures had seemed to mutate, and create these strange things, and with further inspection by internal I had found out that their was an attempt at communication before a member of the team who had lost a loved one, in Stehr’s expedition had acted in ‘self-defence’. Internal too had seemed to be losing their mind, if they had made such an attempt to condone murder as a ‘self-defensive act’

Pursuing my course of action, had begun to bite back. I would be too late to act once two unlikely people had defined themselves as crusaders reclaiming their land. Without any express permission beside their own fears, and larger support from the rig, Ntsay, and Stehr had deployed themselves with a large contingent of security personnel to attempt to secure the artefact. Stehr had mentioned earlier that he must have had something that allowed him to live, beside the luck. They were going to get themselves killed, so as I rushed to analytics, I cleared most of the team, only leaving myself with the most loyal and trustworthy hands. It had taken a moment for someone to voice their discovery that coincided with their monitoring of Ntsay, the infamous transmissions from the Artefact had begun again.

It was a video loop, that had seemed to attempt to fashion a person almost from scratch. Its attempt at recognition coincided with the models it procured from the PESU corpses, and the sea life it had attained through its symbiosis attempts. The unrest outside of the room, had grown as a mob had assembled demanding their right to communicate with the outside world. I ignored them, as I honed in closely to the broadcast, which had soon grown erratic. We soon realised the problem was heightened as the seismic shifts we began to feel had been produced by the artefact moving towards us. It would seem as Ntsay’s team had been lost, as I demanded some real action from the team, and for a second, I expected some words from Stehr at this tense moment, but they were none. I was left alone, and as shameful as it is to admit I had felt as if they had it coming for being such idiots.

On incident, a junior officer in the panic had managed to inverse the feed, which had temporarily halted the artefact. The team had relocated the Ntsay vessel, but it had seemed wrecked, as I pushed  for them to continue whatever they had done to stop the artefact. The head, wondered it a possible overfeeding could change something, as he instructed a more varied field on information be sent, and as what they had was mostly was the rigs data centre for the crew personal information, as we fed it whatever it wanted, so it could stop.

It had suddenly retreated, and slowly it crawled itself back to the crater we uncovered. Another team had simultaneously run a their purported hack, but what they uncovered was just a series of generated images, their context being a series of defineless shapes.

Triskele had not been as impressed, once the body count had been tallied, and the true scale of what happened was known. They feigned an excuse of economic, and logistic concerns as they moved their operations into the Mozambique channel; payments, NDA’s (which they might litigate now), and severances for the worst cases were dispatched. Dr. Ntsay, and Mr. Stehr had luickly survived, but their testimonial in the internal investigations had plundered all our reputations enough to be barred from the seas, and maybe that’s for the best, anyway. I don’t know where, how, and what it intends next, but I know anything near it won’t be safe.

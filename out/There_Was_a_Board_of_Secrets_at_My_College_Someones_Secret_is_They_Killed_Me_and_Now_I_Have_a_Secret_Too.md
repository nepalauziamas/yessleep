I’ve lived a strange life. And there’s a sinister and very singular reason why. But we’ll get to that in another story. 

This one begins in 2010. I was a senior at a massive public university. The campus was always alive and buzzing, its own city, teeming with life. Every time I looked down from an upper floor, I thought we looked like a beehive, infinitely humming along, never resting. 

I had been accepted to law school and graduation was looming. On paper, life was good.

Reality was much darker. 

I knew even then. Something was off. Wrong. I had been through so much in life, but this, this felt different. I could sense my health slipping away. The vitality in me felt like it was being drained in a slow trickle, just enough so I could really feel the thirst. 

The worst part, at least back then, was the infinite exhaustion. I slept, but it was a pantomime. I never reaped a moment of restorative rest. I took to calling it “The Tired.” 

Each day became longer as the Tired compounded. I saw every doctor I could find, endless sleep studies, medications, and surgeries. Nothing made a dent. It was written off as the result of PTSD and my decline continued. 

In my heart, I knew it was something more.

It was December, and I was schlepping my way to one of my literature classes. Writers Study Poetry, they called it. Just picking up my feet felt like trying to escape quicksand. I could feel my body desperately searching for energy, scraping the bottom and never finding any.

That was the first time I saw The Board of Secrets.

I thought it was strange, but I had to admit, I felt a devilish curiosity. Secrets have always fascinated me. They’re the unofficial currency of a world powered by rumors. 

The Board was enormous, nailed to four different posts for support. Papers of every color and size gently fluttered in the wind, secrets tacked, unsigned, for all the world to see. I perused them. Some were mild, boring, or downright stupid. Some were intense but not all that surprising. No startling confessions that could really put anyone at risk. 

I decided the Board deserved better. I ripped a scrap piece of paper from my spiral notebook and jotted down “I was a powerful drug dealer in one of America’s biggest cities as a teenager. I got away with it. There is so much blood on my hands.” 

I regret everything I did as a teenager, and I wrestled with tremendous guilt about getting away with, well, everything. Memories of all my wicked deeds can flooding back. 

I’d be a liar, though, if I said I didn’t experience a small thrill as I tacked my secret to the Board. I could feel a slight shit-eating grin creeping across my face. Truth be told, I was too tired for shame.

And then I saw it. My smile fell into my stomach, along with my heart. 

I don’t know how I missed it. It was impossible to miss. I swear it wasn’t up there when I first walked up. Written on a giant, sliced up piece of pink poster board, in astoundingly beautiful handwriting, were just three words:

**I KILLED PAPPY**

I felt my hand tremor. 

That had been happening a lot lately. Doctors had scoured my brain for every possible neurological anomaly. There was no rhyme or reason to it. I tried to tell myself whatever health problem was plaguing me caused the tremor in that moment. That it wasn’t fear. But I was lying to myself.

I’m Pappy. 

That’s not my real name, of course. It was a nickname given to me when I was young. 

I tried to reason with myself. I’m from the South. “Pappy” is a common nickname for grandfathers, especially in rural areas, and there was an enormous, renowned agricultural program at my school. It attracted the “smart kids” from every little one-horse town supported by diners, gas stations, and speed traps. 

They could be confessing to killing their grandfather. Or maybe someone else’s. And I certainly wasn’t the only person around with that nickname. It could be just made-up nonsense. But more to the point, the secret said “killed,” and I was alive. 

That simple fact should have been reassuring, but I didn’t really feel like I was alive anymore. Not really. I certainly wasn’t living some sort of Bruce Willis, Sixth Sense existence, an errant dead man with unfinished business drifting among the living. I was very much alive and real. That should have made me feel better. It didn’t. 

My paranoia began to escalate. The note was written in the past tense, but who’s to say they weren’t confessing ahead of time to something they were about to do? 

It seemed insane to me. It couldn’t be about me. 

Everyone from my hometown certainly knew and used my nickname. Friends, strangers, teachers, coaches. But when I got to college I started going by my real name. I had dealt drugs under an entirely separate, painstakingly forged identity; but, in my mind, “Pappy” would always be tethered to a time and place I hoped to forget. 

I had friends from my hometown at school with me. Plenty. And they all still called me “Pappy,” despite my chagrin and protestations. And undoubtedly our new friends, random partygoers, and the like had heard them using it. 

Hell, I lived with my best friend, Steve. We’d been two strange peas in a pod since we were three. His girlfriend, Lauren, spent half of her time at our place, caught somewhere between a relationship and babysitting. 

Although he was certainly the most original thinker I’d ever met, Steve struggled with school. Severe ADHD can handicap even the most powerful minds. My friends joked I was getting two degrees, as I did most of his work and often took his tests. Steve tried. He really did. The deck was just stacked against him. His time was occupied with tangential learning and some of the most beautiful art no one has ever seen. 

Lauren had been my friend, if someone like Lauren could have friends, all through high school. Her and I shared every AP class together. While I was off getting high and off selling crack in the city, she would toil until she collapsed in the never-ending pursuit of academic perfection.

Steve met Lauren through me. You’d never seen a couple less compatible. She was cold, calculating, unforgiving, unimpressed. Steve was warm and life sprang out of him. They never made my sense to me, but the three of us trudged through college together.

I thought of all the people I knew from home that were here. Sean, a pseudointellectual who desperately coveted Steve’s attention. Jake, a serial manipulator. Kevin, who just seemed to float and follow, never making any mark on the world. Pat, a narcissist with rich parents and a gambling problem. The list went on and on. 

We didn’t come from a happy place. 

Still. The odds this post had anything to do with me were astronomical. 

I put the facts together. It was written in the past tense. It could be about anyone. And the penmanship made the letters look like art rather than script, so flowing, and distinct. I didn’t remotely recognize the handwriting. Who could forget writing like that?

I warily let it go. 

The Board stayed up, and the secrets piled up. 

Despite being shaken, I’d cruise by the board daily to read new ones. “Stole money out of mom’s purse for drugs.” “Dad was gay, but I never told our family.” “I still wet the bed in college.” All the classics that seem thrilling to the confessor but were just mundane TV plots to the audience. 

I was reading an especially long one written in chicken scratch about someone’s love of writing bestiality erotic fiction online when I saw it.

**I KILLED PAPPY**

**ON**

A new word. 

It threw me. 

That same bewitching calligraphy. A delayed confession, a prompt promising more specifics. I was surprised the university had left it up or that there wasn’t some hullabaloo about it. It seemed like a murder confession. It stood out among the inane petty crimes and creepy indiscretions. 

I shook the paranoia straight out of my head. 

It was December. My last round of finals. My birthday. Graduation. Exhaustion, exhaustion, with an extra helping of exhaustion. Chronic nausea and vomiting were staring to become the norm. I felt a dull pain slowly etching across my body, like a snake silently weaving its way down a still river. 

I had plenty on my plate. 

I swung by my poetry professor’s office the next day. I had accidentally become something of a star in the class. For whatever reason, the sicker I felt, the more my poetry improved. I guess that’s the nature of suffering. I had to drop off my final compilation, one step closer to rest, even if it was an exercise in futility. 

I was leaving her office when I saw it. 

I was freezing and stupidly underdressed. An old habit. I was trying to run to stay warm and get to the campus bus quickly. I was athletic but I felt like I was trying to swim through Jell-O. The Tired. I came a screeching halt as I passed the Board.

**I KILLED PAPPY**

**ON**

**DECEMBER**

Another new word. 

The confession was growing, morphing, becoming more specific. Was I right? Maybe someone was confessing in the past tense to something that would later become true. 

Fear crept up my spine. I put the pieces together.

I was Pappy. It was December. The confession was slowly growing. Someone I knew could be writing it, watching me, hoping to torture me. Or planning to kill me. Maybe both. 

Or it was all in my head. It could just be nonsense. I sat there, staring at the elegantly written confession, and realized I was too tired to care in that moment. I went home. 

I tried not to think about it. But I became increasingly suspicious of all my friends. I stopped talking to everyone but Steve and Lauren. Steve, for all his wild intelligence, didn’t have a devious bone in his body. He was a Golden Retriever who just happened to have a fascination with quantum physics and symbolic logic. Lauren, despite her frigid ways, was the busiest person I knew, blunt and cruel to your face. They felt safe. 

I hadn’t told Steve or Lauren what I saw on the Board. They rarely went to that part of campus and if they saw something, they never mentioned anything. I wanted to tell someone, but it seemed silly. Delusional. 

When my paranoia finally started to overwhelm me, I told Steve. 

It was late at night on the 17th. We were a few beers deep watching some random indie movie instead of studying, and I just blurted it out. 

I figured I would only tell him. I assumed he’d reassure me. He might be irresponsible with the attention span of a coked-out squirrel, but he undoubtedly had the highest IQ of anyone I’d ever known. He was just always being measured by the wrong yardstick. 

Unfortunately, I forgot about how wild his imagination could be.

He wanted to see it then, right then. He came up with all sorts of theories linked to my past. Steve was the only one who truly knew the depth and depravity of my transgressions. No censorship, no omissions. No secrets between us. His mind was working at a mile a minute, darting like a desperate gazelle as the nipping lion closed in. 

So we headed to the school.

My hands were freezing as we walked into the howling wind toward the Board. Despite having the opposite reaction I’d hoped, his random theorizing surprisingly brought me comfort. It was easier to argue he was wrong than face my own mind. I was rubbing my hands together and blowing into them for warmth when I realized Steve had stopped a few feet behind me. He had gone silent and still. 

Steve was never silent or still. 

I turned back and looked at him. I’d never seen him look so afraid. He was always recklessly fearless. Normally towering, it was the only time he looked small to me. The infinite sunlight of his face was gone, replaced by a ghastly white.

“It’s about you, Pappy.” 

“Steve, I told you, we have no way to know if it’s about…”

He pointed at the board. 

**I KILLED PAPPY**

**ON**

**DECEMBER 18TH**

My legs start to buckle. I sat down on a small bench and dropped my head into my hands. Steve sat down next to me, leaning over, and comforting me.

December 18th was my birthday. 

Fuck paranoia, fuck coincidences. It was about me.

“We get in your car, and we go. We get the Hell out of Dodge. Right now. We hide you.”

He had a point. 

If someone were trying to do more than just torment me, they’d have to follow us a long, long way. Over twenty years of friendships and several macabre misadventures, we’d invented plenty of bail out plans. We’d even used a few. Stories for other times. 

“Pappy, we need to go, THIS MINUTE, RIGHT FUCKING NOW.”

I’d never heard his voice so strained. It was desperate, like an injured dog’s whine. Uncomfortable and uncharacteristic.

“Pappy, let’s go.” I couldn’t tell if he was begging or trying to order me. His eyes wouldn’t leave the board, like he couldn’t tear them away. It seemed like he knew more than he was letting on. I felt suspicion creep in. 

“Steve, we have to think this through. We can’t do your impulsive shit the second someone decides to fuck with me.”

“PAPPY. LOOK AT YOUR FUCKING PHONE. LOOK WHAT TIME IT IS.”

His howl was bloodcurdling. 

I pulled out my phone and we both stared at the time. It was 12:37 a.m. 

It was my birthday. The 18th. 

In all the exhaustion, the urgency, the paranoia, I had lost track of time. We sat there, staring at the time for what felt like an eternity. Finally, I shot up.

“Okay, let’s get the Hell out of here. We’ll go to Lu…”

Steve was sitting on the bench, trembling. 

He turned to me, his face more pallor than before. He didn’t point this time. He didn’t yell. He whispered, barely moving his mouth.

“Pappy, look at the Board.”

**I KILLED PAPPY**

**ON**

**DECEMBER 18th, 20**

I whipped my head in every direction. Someone had added part of the year while we were sitting there. 

I was scared. Petrified, really. I had made a life out of dodging death. I was shocked how calm I was as I faced him.

“Why, Steve?” My voice was quiet and vulnerable. 

Steve was standing, fists clenched, eyes fluttering in every direction, seeming to check for my would-be killer. 

I didn’t buy it. 

“You’d make a great actor, but you can drop it. Why are you doing this to me? You’re my best friend. If you want to kill me, kill me. If you want to torture me, you’ve tortured me. Just tell me why. And how. That’s all I want to know.”

“Pappy, what are you talking about? WE HAVE TO GO.”

His manic energy began to make me feel like a wounded animal trapped in a corner. Scared and aggressive. 

“So insistent I hop in a car alone with you. So coincidental we drove here on my birthday. And now numbers just happen to be appearing as we’re sitting here, Mr. I don’t want to go to college, I want to be a fucking artist. Nice calligraphy. Freehand? Or did you trace it? Which of our idiot friends is helping you with this?”

My voice began to explode, a sudden rush of desperate, rare energy coursing through me.

“What was it? Was it abandoning you as a friend when I was dealing and using? Me getting away with it? Did someone OD and die I don’t know about? Do you want vengeance? Some stupid slight? TELL ME WHY.”

It was my turn to scream. I felt like I’d ripped a vocal cord. You could hear my accusations echoing between the empty buildings. Little snowflakes were dropping, bringing with them the deafening silence of winter. The wind had stopped.

A tear fell from Steve’s eye. He pointed to the Board. 

**I KILLED PAPPY**

**ON**

**DECEMBER 18th, 2005**

A new, full word. 

A final one. Or so I thought. One that didn’t make any sense.

“I…I don’t understand.” Steve sat back on the bench. I could see him wracking his brain, searching. I plopped down next down next to him. I felt like I might pass out or hurl. “Kill me,” I thought. “I already feel dead.”

“Steve, you honestly want me to believe this isn’t you? Just do what you gotta do. Just don’t lie to me. I remember that birthday vividly. It was my last one before I got clean and quit dealing.”

I let out a long sigh, feeling my anger subside. The truth might be awful, but at least I knew it now. 

“Other than my parents, who’d have to care enough to kill me, I only saw you. They had me on lockdown, but they let me out to see you on my birthday. We watched Fight Club together. It was when I told you I was going to get clean. I went straight home after. I never saw anyone else.”

Steve’s eyes were bulging out of his face like a grotesque cartoon, looking past me. “What the fucking fuck?” His voice was a tortured whisper, barely audible. 

He didn’t have to point this time. My eyes followed his to the Board. 

**I KILLED PAPPY**

**ON**

**DECEMBER 18th, 2005**

**TOXIC MOLD**

Suddenly the years of medical mysteries, the Tired, all the negative tests and symptoms made sense. The slow, painful progression. Mold must have been colonizing me, building in my body for years.

A tear fell from my eye. I gently grabbed Steve’s hand and squeezed it. 

“Whatever I did, Steve, I’m sorry. I’m sure your intention was to torture me, and it worked, but thank you for at least telling me in the end. The not knowing was the worst part.”

Steve didn’t look afraid anymore. He looked enraged. Full of fury. I figured whatever maelstrom of resentment, whatever deep well of brooding hate he nursed within, was about to be unleashed on me. I deserved it. 

I decided then and there, regardless of what he'd done, I loved him. I wouldn’t hurt him or take this from him.

“COME OUT YOU RUTHLESSS MONSTER. I KNOW IT’S YOU. I’LL KILL YOU FOR THIS. I DON’T CARE IF IT TAKES MY WHOLE LIFE, YOU’LL BE SPITTING UP BLOOD.”

Like Job wailing at God, Steve was screaming, raging into the empty night. 

“Steve, what…”

“Pappy. That is my writing.”

I looked up at him and smiled meekly. “It’s okay. Really. If you can, just tell me why. I’ll always love you, man, and I don’t care what you’ve done. You’re my best friend. If you did this, I deserved this.”

“It’s my writing, but I didn’t do this. I didn’t write that.”

His fists were balled so tightly they were red as hellfire from all the pooled-up blood. 

“I don’t understand.”

“When I lost you, I threw myself into drawing. It helped me cope. I started practicing with words, making my own fonts. It reminded me of when we were young. I would draw and you would doodle all the titles to your poems and stories with different stylings. I suppose it was a way to connect with the best friend I thought I’d lost. That handwriting up there, I designed it. Took forever. But I didn’t write those words. And I have nothing to do with this. But I’m going to kill her for it.”

“Her?”

“Someone got the font from my notebooks. Pappy, we weren’t alone on your birthday, remember?”

My blood went cold. He was right. 

“Lauren was there. I told her you were talking about getting clean. She said you couldn’t come over unless she was there. She said she didn’t trust you or my judgment. She…she cooked you a cheeseburger.”

I felt like the world was plummeting around me. 

“I remember now. She kept pushing and pushing me to eat it. Kept going on about how I looked hollow from the drugs and not eating. I never really thought about it because I was so focused on getting clean, but that level of compassion was…unlike her. That’s how she got me.”

Steve was silently sobbing. “This is my fault.”

I sat and put my arm around him. “It isn’t, Steve. This isn’t on you.”

He shook his head violently, rejecting the notion.

“She was always cold, but you have no idea how messed up she is behind closed doors. And being your friend was always a mask she was wearing. She hated you. Hates you. Envies you. All our fights have always been about you. She is obsessed with you. You did all those messed up things and still managed to always best her. Every test, every paper, you’d stumble in from a bender, drugged out, and still knock it out of the park. I’ve never seen someone so resentful.”

Steve shook his head in disbelief. 

“Lauren burned herself out, drove herself mad trying to graduate at the top. But she was no you. She never had your brains. She couldn’t pull it of thin air like you. Make magic, make something out of nothing. I never told you any of it because I figured she was just being her normal ugly self. I thought you’d been through enough. I thought they were just impotent rantings. I should’ve known she would hurt you.”

My heart ached for him. I felt like he was shrinking out existence right before my eyes. 

“Steve, there was no way to have known that. This is on her. I’m too sick and tired. Let’s just go home. I need some rest. I’m sure I have to see some doctors and get some grim news when I wake up.”

Steve helped me up, and we went home. 

The doctors tested me for mold toxicity. Taught me all about it. 

Seventy-five percent of the population can’t even get it. Doesn’t show up on any scans. You can’t really find it unless you’re looking for it. Explained all the symptoms. They told me it had colonized my whole body long ago, and that they could treat it and prolong things. I might even have decades. 

Most cases could be beaten, they said, but the concentrated severity of my exposure and the length it went untreated meant I’d always be sick, my symptoms would get worse, and someday, when they couldn’t push it off anymore, it would kill me. They even pinned down the specific strain, one known to cause long term suffering before inevitable demise. 

I never let it slip that I knew the source or what caused me to suspect mold toxicity in the first place. 

We couldn’t find Lauren over the next few days. Her apartment was empty. Steve staked out her exams, but we found out she took them early. She was just gone. 

Insanity nearly overcame us as we tried to figure out so many things. Like how she got her hands on that particular mold or how she knew it would work? How in the Hell did she manage to add words that night, right under our noses?

It was too much. I gave up. 

Graduation day came four days after my birthday, the 22nd. Steve wanted to give up everything to find her. I told him to just let it go. He seemed to agree. 

I sat on the bench looking at the Board of Secrets, wearing my cap and gown, the morning sun lighting up my cheek, feeling worn to the nub. I was debating even going to graduation. Steve wasn’t around when I woke up. I figured he got a jump start on getting to the ceremony. The entire school was a ghost town. Everyone had gone home, was at graduation, or was off getting drunk somewhere. 

And then there was me. Slowly decaying and staring. Staring at a confession to my own murder, long in the making, manifesting itself inside me. 

I shook my head wistfully, thinking of how screwed up it all was. I deserved it. Not for her reasons. Fuck her reasons. They were petty and low. But I knew I deserved it for all the things I’d done. And now I knew at least my fate. That was something. 

That’s when I saw her. 

One moment there was no one there, the next, Lauren was standing in front of the Board, her back to me, admiring her beastly work. 

She turned to me slowly with a smile I suppose was made up of whatever Hell is composed of. “Brilliant, wasn’t it? And look at you, the little dead junkie with his cute, meaningless cap and gown.” 

She’d always been cold, off, but this, this was different. 

A different person. Not really a person at all. A hollow thing. Somewhere at the crossroads between pure evil and the emptiness of the void. Her smile was as vicious as her eyes were empty. 

I was too exhausted for repartee. 

“Sure, Lauren,” I said levelly, “you win.” She wanted to goad me. It was obvious. I wouldn’t give her the satisfaction.

I thought about trying to kill her. Give her the last of what I had. Go out Irish, on my feet, fighting. 

The Tired was too much. I was too sick for violence. She had to be prepared, anyway. Gun, knife, mace, something like that. It was all I could do to crawl out of bed that day and get dressed. 

She could have the win. I was too tired to care anymore.

I tuned her out. Sent my mind to another time and place. Steve and I exploring the woods behind my house, still innocent and vibrant. 

She was halfway through some ranting, demonic justification when it happened. 

Her hand instantly dove into her coat pocket for a weapon, I assumed. But, to both of our surprise, he walked right past her, briskly, with righteous purpose. 

Can’t say I’d ever seen that on him before. Righteous purpose. It was a good look. It was in that moment that I realized how little I deserved him. His friendship. 

Steve marched straight up to the board and tacked a note I couldn’t quite make out. I noticed he was wearing thick gloves.

“I…I have a gun, Steve.” She trembled. She tried to hide it, but it was plain as day. She pulled out a pistol and pointed it at him. He looked larger than life again. A swagger in his step. Life brimming in his eyes. 

He smiled at her, almost beaming. “And I don’t. No knife, no gun, no nothing. No violence here today, Lauren. Just a secret to add to the Board.”

Steve strolled over to me, gently helped me up, and looked at her. “One day, one year, one hundred years. However long Pappy has left, we’ve got lives to lead. You don’t.”

Steve helped me hobble closer to the Board. Scrawled in that same unforgettable handwriting was a new secret:

**I KILLED LAUREN**

**ON**

**DECEMBER 22nd, 2010**

Steve looked at her, his smile gone, replaced with the grim visage of a harbinger. 

“I hope you enjoyed that salad you ate half an hour ago. It looked lonely to me, so I added a special ingredient. Had to get the dose right. Otherwise, it’d be too quick. A salad. Weird choice for a last meal, a real bummer, but you always were twisted.” His voice was cut with a mocking edge.

She tried to laugh it off, but there was no confidence in her voice. 

“Last meal? Oh, what? You put mold in my salad? And it’s going to kill instantly, is that it? You always were his dimwitted shadow. Or are you the moronic, brawny superhero and he was your damaged little brainy sidekick? Whatever you are, you are to the end. I can’t decide which of you is more pathetic.”

Her laughter heightened, cascading across the campus. She sounded like the depraved offspring of a hyena and the Joker. The shit nightmares are made of. It made me shudder. 

“At least he was smart. He didn’t deserve to be, but at least he was. You idiot, you don’t think I had myself tested to make sure I wasn’t susceptible to mold toxicity on the off chance I might accidentally expose myself? You’ll never know what lengths I had to go to make sure he could even get it. Can your tiny brain comprehend how impossibly hard that was? Or how much work it took to find and steal a strain of mold so perfectly balanced that would take? Years of endless suffering, incurable, with a lock on death?”

She was almost mesmerizing. You couldn’t tell if she was rambling to us, herself, or the pale blue sky. Maybe all three. 

“It took me years, Steve. YEARS. The planning, the preparation, the obsession, the dedication it took to earn this moment. Keeping you close to me. Do you think I wanted to be with YOU? A nothing like you? It took EVERYTHING to pull this off. Like you could ever be that smart, you meandering dipshit.” 

I could see spittle and drool escaping out of the corners of her mouth, slowly oozing in the cold. Her whole body was shaking but she seemed like she was in a trance, unaware. I noticed her face began to contort. Her neck was twitching. 

I looked over at Steve. His eyes never left her. I felt his hand on my shoulder, reassuring me.

“You two make quite the pair. One of you too braindead and attention deficit to ever achieve anything, the other handed everything on a silver platter, who got to rely on genetics and luck while people like me burned ourselves away in the desperate pursuit of something real. Neither of you have earned a moment like this. Neither of you will ever know it takes, have what it takes, to earn a moment like this.” 

Her evil grin returned, as did the confidence in her feral laughter. Her whole body began some ugly, twisted movement, like a crackhead dancing on a downtown corner, lost in the haze. 

Steve looked me in the eye, and you could see the love of a best friend there. I also saw something I’d never seen before. Sheer focus, absolute surety. I had lost, but I knew he had won.

He whipped his head around and stared straight into the emptiness that was her. “You’re right, Lauren. Couldn’t take any chances with you. It would have to be something certain, lethal, and, for Pappy’s sake, agonizingly painful. And I’d have to get the timing perfect.”

He chuckled, like a poker player about to cut down a braggart by revealing the winning hand, the slow roll. You could see the panic in her eyes, the loss of control in her body. I wondered quietly if she knew she had pissed herself. 

“Funny thing, you neurotics. Everything always has to be just so. Those are the rules. The order to the entropy. That’s why you hate Pappy. You can’t stand he played outside the rules, colored outside the lines, and still won. Pappy is…unpredictable. Chaotic. A mind that sits alone, for better and for worse, on its own plane.”

Steve hugged me tighter with one hand, threw his other in the air with bravado. 

“Kudos to you. Hard to nail down someone like that, give them a slow death. Far, far easier with a rule-bound psycho like you. You always *had* to have salad for lunch every, single day, and you just *had* to have almonds in it. Same time, like clockwork. Those are the rules, right? Everything just so. No deviations allowed. Luckily, almonds happen mask the taste perfectly.”

Steve’s voice rose, louder and louder, each syllable seeming to wrench her body.

“You see, Lauren, a “nothing” like me understands you both. I found your evil ass yesterday. I knew you’d stick around. I know you. All of this would be pointless if you couldn’t watch the end. You’d want to revel in it, like a pig in shit. So…. predictable.”

Steve glared into her with utter revile. 

“Gave me a chance to set things even. Broke in and stole a little something from the chem. lab last night. Killed all the cameras there, and in this area, too. Destroyed all the footage from the last few weeks. Always wore a mask, kept my gloves on. Easy enough to follow you, figure out what you were up to, slip a little something in your salad while your back was turned. Take the bullets out of that gun I gave you awhile back. Shame you never practiced with it. You might’ve noticed the difference in the weight when the clip and chamber are empty.”

Steve blew out a long, dramatic sigh.

“Pappy…well, he’s complicated. Who knows what he’ll do at any given moment? See, you need a long con for a mind like his. You? Well. You’re simple. Warped, but pedestrian. You only took a day. Guess I didn’t earn mine. Guess I didn’t need to.”

Steve’s smile shifted to something gleeful, something awful, something joyous, something primal.

“Oh, shit, Pappy, hold on, I forgot a word.”

Steve dropped his arm from around my shoulder, sauntered up the board, and scrawled, in that haunting handwriting I’ll never forget in perfect free hand, a single word. 

Lauren’s mouth hung open, like a victim sucking a deep, last breath as the pillow came swooping in. 

Steve ambled over to me, put my arm around his shoulders, threw his arm around mine, and gave one last retort. “I guess I have a secret now, too. I guess Pappy and I both do.”

I let out my first real laugh in months. My voice, a raspy, sickly whisper, came out all the same.

“When the mold gets me, Lauren, I’ll see you in Hell. It’s where we’re both headed for the things we’ve done. Keep a cozy spot for me. Because on that day, it will be my turn, and I have some ideas brewing. Don’t worry, we’ll have eternity. I’ll earn mine. I promise.”

Steve and I turned, arm in arm, and walked away forever. Away from the Board of Secrets, from that school, from Lauren, from that time and place. 

We could hear her trying to scream behind us, but it all came out in bubbling gargles. The dry firing of a barren clip as she pulled a useless trigger at our backs. 

We heard the empty gun hit the ground and after a few steps, her body followed suit.

I looked back one last time, to see her just like me: a living, suffering corpse, something awful blossoming inside. 

She was writhing, foaming at the mouth while her hands grasped and clutched the air, catching the nothingness. Her eyes were pure ivory as her entire body convulsed, bones snapping loudly like crunched twigs as the silent snow began to fall and canopy the world in white. 

Desperate. Tortured. Leaking on the ground, just below the Board.

One last look at Steve’s secret, *our* secret.

The final word.

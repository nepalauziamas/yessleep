I run a private campground.  Let me make something clear here: the majority of people that I meet are decent, sensible folks.  They don’t follow the lights, they don’t leave petty 1-star reviews on Google, and they don’t murder people unnecessarily.  But that’s boring to talk about, isn’t it?  That’s why you get to hear about the [spectacularly stupid things people do](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/m8xleq/how_to_survive_camping_the_mundane_rules/).  And to continue that trend, let’s talk about the locals today.

It’s a good thing my town is isolated and probably thinks reddit is slang for some new street drug the city kids are doing in their coffee shops and boutique bookstores.  Because as the title alludes, we’re going to talk about more of the dumb shit they’ve gotten up to over the years!

If you’re new here, you should [start at the beginning](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/clp5h4/how_to_survive_camping/) and if you’re totally lost, [this might help](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/comments/fz6a1d/how_to_survive_camping_index/).

Let’s talk about rule #13 again.  It used to be rule #15 but then I deleted a few so it’s #13 now.  I’m sure that won’t confuse anyone.

Rule #13 - Don’t eat food you find sitting out around the campsite. It’s not yours and worse, it might be an offering and you will offend whatever it is intended for.

[I told you earlier](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/jpl1fa/how_to_survive_camping_rule_15_the_cake_is_still/) about how this rule covers a lot of different things.  Eating food that isn’t yours is an invitation for terrible things to happen to you in so many ways.  Sometimes it’s bait, sometimes it’s a test, and worst of all: sometimes it’s an offering.

Because if it’s an offering, that means you just pissed off an ancient thing.

Which is certainly exciting, but it’s also not very complicated.  Doesn’t make for a good story.  Someone eats an offering, the deity it belonged to smites the person out of existence.  Now, it’s not like people go around leaving offerings everywhere on my land.  Some people *do*, but sometimes whatever ancient being is passing through leaves them out themself.  A test, perhaps, or a trap.  I suppose a living offering is far more satisfying than a pile of gold or a handful or wheat or whatever they already have.  Or maybe they just get forgetful and are like, oh hey, didn’t I have an offering, where did I leave that lying around?

We’ve all done that, right?  Put something important in a safe location and thereby doom yourself to never find it again?  That was my tax documents this year.  It’s fine, I eventually found them after I turned the house upside down.

You may also be wondering: how often *do* we get deities coming through?  Not often, as far as I’m aware.  Probably about as frequently as everyone else.  Yes, even you have likely lived somewhere that a deity passed through.  These ancient things roam the world as they please, after all.

There is a way to bring an ancient being around, however.  I wouldn’t call it summoning, for these creatures cannot be compelled to do anything they do not care to do.  It’s more like… enticement.  Like how we leave out stockings and an offering of food on Christmas Eve and Saint Nicholas, being the good saint that he is, obliges to stop by.

Not all saints are kind. And not all ancient things are saints.

I remember the night a goddess came to our town.  My mother stood outside at the tail end of sunset, risking the appearance of the little girl with her tardiness.  My father wouldn’t let me go to her and he called for her to come inside.  She did, reluctantly.  There was fire on the horizon, she said.  I peered out the window but all I saw was the sunset.  Certainly, the sun blazed red and stained the sky with its own radiant fire, but I didn’t understand why this made her so grim.  Or why dad looked so worried.

In time you develop a sense for these things, when the world is out of sorts.  For a long time I’ve thought it was just experience, the sorts of things you learn from your parents or from seeing them firsthand.  Mattias’s journal makes me wonder if there’s more to it.  Perhaps human intuition can be tuned to pick up these vibrations that the inhuman world makes.

Beau once spoke of a web. (has it been over a year now?) One I was blind to.  I wonder if someday I will feel it tremble and know what it means.

A few days later my parents received a social visit from someone in town.  Well… it started as a social visit.  A couple dropped by unexpectedly and they brought with them a pecan pie and one of their children.  I was sent to my room with the girl, who was a few years younger than me, to keep her entertained.  We mostly picked on each other, for we went to the same school and she knew me by reputation, until I grew tired of it and we snuck into the living room to play video games while our parents were in the kitchen.

I wasn’t entirely focused on the game as I’d played it before and wasn’t terribly interested in walking someone I was forced to entertain through the controls.  I half-listened to the conversation instead.

There was something strange going on at their farm, they said.  Something was coming around the barn at night.

“Did it start a few days ago?” my mother asked.

The pair latched onto that.  Yes, it had, the man replied eagerly.  Did they know what it was?

“I have a few ideas,” mom replied.  “I don’t think it’ll be a problem for you, though.  It should pass on by.”

“It’s bothering the children though,” the woman said.  “They can’t sleep.  They’re afraid.  Could you just stop by and take a look?  I’m sure if we told them that the campground people investigated and say it’s safe they’d calm right down.”

I felt pretty smug at overhearing that.  The girl next to me was intently focused on the game, but I couldn’t help but smirk.  Scaredy-cat.  *I* had to listen to a little girl crying outside my window all night and a beast that dragged her away at dawn and *I* wasn’t afraid.

I think… I was afraid back then.  I just didn’t know how to admit it to myself at the time.

“I guess we can, if we find time,” my mother said reluctantly.

“It’s spring, there’s a lot to do around the campground,” my father hastily added, trying to cover for my mother’s disinterest.  He always was more concerned about our reputation around town.

“We know it’s a burden, but we’d truly appreciate it,” the man said.  “It’d probably go a long way towards making folks around here realize you’re helpful for more than just killing monsters, too.”

And there was the bait.  My father seized on it as they likely knew he would.  He was desperate to repair the legacy his own father left behind.

Our guests finished their slices of pie and began the process of leaving.  Then the man called to the girl, sharply, saying nothing more than her name.

She dropped the controller with a gasp, as if she’d been shocked.  Her face was pale.

“They’re going to kill me,” she whispered.

She wasn’t speaking to me.  I had no idea what to say and nor was I given the chance to reply, for she hurriedly scrambled to her feet and followed them to the door.  She kept her head down the entire time and didn’t say goodbye until her mother prodded her to.  I assumed at the time that she was going to be in trouble for playing video games.  Some parents were like that.  Technically the rule was my brother and I weren’t allowed to play on school nights, but I figured I’d get away with it since we had a guest.  (I did)

The next day I returned home from school to find my mother getting ready to go out.  Dad had prevailed on her.  She’d stop by their house this afternoon and take a look around.  She was snapping at my dad, irritated at being roped into this chore.

“We know what it is!” she shouted at him from the bedroom.  “Their kids just need to toughen up a little.”

“Honey, not everyone is like you.  We don’t all chase off a devil in highschool.”

“Yeah, and it shows.”

I pretended they weren’t arguing and started laying out my homework on the kitchen table.  Sadly, I was not going to be left out of it this time.  My mom came into the kitchen like a tornado.  Focused, direct, and pulling everything around her into her wake.

“Let’s go, Kate,” she said coolly.  “You’re coming with me.”

“I have homework-”

I just didn’t want to be forced to interact with kids that didn’t like me.

“This won’t take long.  I just need you to show them there’s nothing to be scared of.”

Now *that* appealed to my base nature.  A chance to show off that I was better than everyone else?  I was *in.*

I don’t recall exactly how old I was, but I was at least in middle school.  I think that’s the age that most kids turn into insufferable shits, right?

The owners eagerly came to greet us when we arrived.  Their farmhouse was of stereotypical build with blue siding and white trim.  There were many like it in the area.  Two stories with a wraparound porch, each painted in vivid colors.  Four children were lined up on the porch, leaning on the railing.

Farming was difficult around here.  The land was broken up by hills and forests.  There wasn’t much flat, consecutive land to make fields out of.  Our farmers could scrape by a living, but they weren’t exactly thriving either.

I guess they kept with it out of a sense of tradition.  Like how we pass the campground from generation to generation.  Some of these farms may even be old land.

“We’re so glad you came,” the woman said, clutching my mother’s hand.

Mom was uncomfortable with her hand being held by this person.  She awkwardly extricated it.  She wasn’t as social as my father, nor was she as diplomatic.  But something about this situation made her uneasy.  It felt *off*.  She asked me later if I had felt it as well.  I told her I’d been paying more attention to the children on the porch, for I recognized some of them from school and didn’t like how they were staring at me like a line of crows.

“You said something was wrong with the barn?” my mom asked.

“Yes, something comes there after dark.  We find claw marks on the inside walls.”

“Claw marks?  On the *inside*?”

They assured her that was what was happening.  Then the woman asked if my mother wanted to sit down for some coffee first and hear the full story.  Mom dismissed the invitation.  Likely she could figure it out from the claw marks alone, she said.  The truth was she didn’t want to be trapped here playing niceties.  That was something my dad was good at.  Not her.

Besides, I had homework I needed to do.  That was her backup excuse.

On the way to the barn, mom whispered to me to stick close to her.  That was my first indication that something was going wrong.  This wasn’t just take a look around and then leave.  Mom’s bored confidence had been replaced with a wary unease.  She kept her gaze up, looking about her for signs that anything was amiss.

Goddesses don’t leave claw marks.  At least, not the kind of goddess mom thought came to town.

Ahead of us, the pair rolled back the barn doors and stood there at the entrance, waiting for us to enter.  Mom stopped at the doorway, not yet stepping through.

“Kind of dark in here,” she complained.

And she refused to go further.  After an awkward moment of standing around with no one speaking, the man reluctantly went inside to get a lantern.  Only once he was inside did she follow him.  The woman remained by the door.  I hesitated.  I didn’t want to go into this barn.  I’d caught on to my mother’s wariness and I feared whatever was inside.  For all my mother’s comments about my bravery, I was afraid.  I wonder if my mother was too.  I’ve never stopped being afraid - I’ve just learned how to drown it with anger.

My mother called to me, softly.  Reluctantly, I hurried to her side.  I wanted to take her hand, but I twisted them together in front of me instead, not wanting to show that I was scared, not even to her.  She’d brought me here to be an example, I told myself.  I glanced furtively around the dark barn.  Stacks of hay obscured the walls.  How would they even know there were claw marks?

“Here you are,” the man said.

He handed the lantern to my mother without turning it on.  And as she ran her hands over its base, searching for the switch, he attacked her.

My mother was expecting this.  Rather - she was expecting *something*.  So when he tried to grab her by the neck, she smashed the lantern in his face.  It didn’t break, but he reeled anyway, and she kicked him in the knee.  He went down hard.

Then the woman grabbed me by my hair.  She dragged me backwards, yelling at my mother to not move an inch.  I glanced up and saw that in her other hand, she had a gun, and it was pointed at my mom.  I didn’t struggle, terrified that the slightest movement would provoke her into firing.  I wasn’t scared of monsters or gods, but I was *terrified* of losing my mother.

It’s a fear I never grew out of.  I was afraid up until the day she died and losing her was even more painful than I imagined it would be.

“There’s no claw marks in here,” my mother said evenly.

She continued to walk forwards, towards the woman, who frantically yelled at her to stay back.

“Shooting me won’t work, will it?  I know what kind of goddess came into town a few days ago.  A goddess of the harvest, right?  Blood has to be spilled in *just* the right way for it to be an offering.  She won’t bless your fields otherwise, will she?”

Behind my mother, the man was struggling to stand, heavily favoring his good knee.  I refrained from crying out to my mom, but she caught my gaze and I knew that she understood.  Only a few more moments before she had to fight him off again.

“Then I’ll shoot you and sacrifice the kid!” the woman snarled.

“Kate can take care of herself.”

There it was.  The signal that it was time to handle this myself.  My mother whirled, just in time to catch the man in the gut with a well-aimed fist.  And I, small but strong from all that time spent chopping wood, grabbed the woman’s arm and forced it sideways.  The gunshot went wild, hitting the barn wall instead and punching through, letting in a small beam of sunlight.  I hung onto her wrist as she attempted to shake me off, keeping her from steadying her aim.  Then a few seconds later my mother was there, having downed the man again with a few more blows to the face.

My mother ripped the gun out of her hands, turned it around, and shot her.

For a moment we just stood there, panting.  Then mom pulled the clip out of the gun and pocketed it.

“I’m sorry, Kate,” she said.  “I didn’t think they’d do something this stupid.”

“I’m okay,” I whispered.

“I know.  I wish you didn’t have to see the evil of mankind, though.  Monsters are bad enough.”

She walked towards the man, who was still on the ground, groaning as he stirred out of his daze.  Mom had about knocked him unconscious.  She crouched by where he lay.

“Mom, their kid said something at our house,” I said, startled by my own voice.  I didn’t know if this was the right time to bring this up but it was like the words were spilling out of me now and I couldn’t take them back.  “She said they’d kill her.”

“That was your youngest, wasn’t it?” my mom asked the man.

She grabbed his collar and pulled him up.  With her other hand she pulled out her pocket knife and flipped it open.

“What would you have tried if we hadn’t come out here?” my mom demanded.

The farmer didn’t answer.  He stared stoically at the barn wall.  I thought of the row of children lined up on the front porch.  My mother was thinking of them as well, for her expression hardened.

“Yeah, I thought so,” she said.

And she slit his throat.

We rolled the barn doors shut behind us.  No doubt the children would know what happened, as mom’s hands were covered in blood, but there was no need for them to see the bodies of their parents in person.  Things would be bad enough for them from here out.  Mom seemed tired as we walked away.  Her shoulder slumped and her steps were slow.

As we approached the house, we found that only one of the children was still outside.  The rest had been herded inside and now only the eldest - a young man - stood at the front porch.  Mom walked up to him but didn’t climb the steps.  He stared down at her and for a moment, the two of them just looked like they would sink to the earth and never rise again.  I think I understand that exhaustion.  The weight of other people’s choices can grind you down into dust if you let it.

“Can you take care of them?” mom asked, jerking her head towards the house.

“Sure,” he replied awkwardly.  “They’d said I’m in the will as the guardian, in case anything were to ever happen.”

“How old are you?”

“Seventeen.”

“Good enough.  I’m sorry.”

He began to cry and quickly turned his head away.

“Yeah,” he choked out.  “Me too.”

Mom seemed about to say something else, but out in the field, the barn burst into flames.  It wasn’t an explosion.  It was just… on fire in an instant.  Like lighting a match, only the entire structure was the match head.  The flames coated the walls and the roof, shining like the setting sun.  Within minutes the ceiling collapsed, belching a gust of debris and smoke.  The walls were quick to tumble inwards and the flames narrowed, spiraling like a tornado.

There would be no bodies left for the children to see, much less bury.

“It seems the goddess has accepted our sacrifice,” my mother said in an odd voice.

Mom took my hand and we walked back to the car.  I didn’t consciously keep track of what happened to that family afterwards, but I heard snippets from my parents over dinner now and again.  The farm prospered that year and the year after and perhaps even longer.  No one else had to die for it.  The goddess's blessing extended through the years, perhaps pitying the children.  These ancient things are cruel to the wicked with one hand and good to the righteous with the other.  Perhaps it was even a saint that came through.  Or a saint that was once a goddess.  Or maybe it was just another ancient thing unknown to us, remnants of some stories told long ago, over and over again, until eventually they were forgotten.

I don’t know.  And the only people that might have told us - the ones that brought it here with the promise of a sacrifice - are long dead.  That’s just how it goes, sometimes.

I’m a campground manager.  I sometimes think about my mother, about how angry she was during that drive back to the campground.  She knew why they’d targeted us.  Enough bad blood around here that they might have gotten away with it.  We’re expendable, after all.  Let the campground people take care of the monsters.  Let them die instead of us.

There’s anger… and then there’s hatred.  I think my mother hated them for what they’d done.  Not just because they’d tried to kill her or because they would have killed their daughter, but because they’d shown me a cruel truth of the world before she thought I was ready.  People can be more evil than the monsters.  They don’t even need to be corrupted by the inhuman, like a bargain with an ancient thing or an inherited power can do.  They can accomplish evil just fine on their own.

Or maybe I’m reading too much into it.  It’s hard to stay naïve.

Anyway, I’ll wrap it up here.  I got a new four wheeler today, courtesy of u/whitmoww and I’m dying to ride it around for a bit.

Gotta enjoy it while it lasts, after all. [\[x\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/)

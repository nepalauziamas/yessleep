I don't know if this is right community where i can tell this story honestly but i want to take this off of my chest and see if anyone has experienced similar paranormal activity. (My English isn't the best so I'll try to explain this as good as possible)

This situation (if i may call it that) started when i was in 7th grade, Sunday rainy night. I was watching a horror movie when my mom came in the living room and scolded me on how i wasn't asleep even though it was 11 pm. Dissatisfied i got up and went to my room, for the context my room didn't have any light bulb so as you can imagine it was pretty dark in it which lead to always using my phone for some light, the light wasn't the only problem though, it was one of the coldest rooms in our house. 

There were just 3 people (Me, my brother who was 7 at that time and my mom) living there, because my father was working overseas and my sister was gone to visit my aunt, so i had to sleep alone (me and my sister shared a room).

I went to my room, the bed was ice cold as always, at first i couldn't fell asleep so i laid there motionless. I was thinking about different things, one of them being on how i didn't want to open my eyes fearing that if i did i could've seen something that i shouldn't.

While i was saying my prayer (which i always do before i fell asleep) i heard something outside of my room, my mother always told me that i should keep the door of my room open so if i needed something and called her she would've been able to hear it easier, so hearing something outside of my room was rather easy, someone was opening the cabinets and looking in some little boxes (is at least what i thought that time). 

It felt like a mouse just fell in some little box and was trying to get out of it, which i tried to convince myself must've been the case, i mean living in the village mice are pretty big problem, but this feeling of somebody's presence outside of my room standing there just by the doorway was bothering and scaring the shit out of me.

I wasn't going to open my eyes and refused to even move a single muscle, pretending to be asleep. The "thing" if i may call it that way came into my room, and i knew this definitely wasn't my mother (or little brother) just by the sound of their breathing and footsteps. I was scared shirtless and i started to do what really seemed logical to me: praying. 

The loud sound of thunder outside wasn't making the situation better, the "thing" came near my bed and stoped there (which i knew by their footsteps), it stood there for at least 10 seconds when it started to move again and now the sound of it's footsteps started to "get distanced" so i assumed they were going away, i let out silent breath which i was holding without even realizing.

At that moment the "thing" stopped moving and it came back, this time though it wasn't standing near my bad, it was walking in circles in my bedroom, i started praying again hoping that god would save me from something that i wasn't supposed to see, my brain warning me not to even dare to open my eyes but my curiosity killing me with the interest of what was in my bedroom. I didn't open my eyes though, i was praying 4th time when the thing wasn't silently walking anymore, but running in circles.

This got me thinking of why my mom couldn't hear anything, it started raining i prayed 7th time already and it was my 8th time when i heard the "thing" stop completely. As if to fool me into thinking that it was gone and i could open my eyes, which i didn't. Rather i finished my prayer after what i heard a loud sound if thunder and the "thing" dashed out of my room, i heard the dishes break and our main door being open.

In the end i did open my eyes and looked around. There was nothing, i was too scared to get up and check if the dishes were broken or the door was open. I simply turned around and thanked god that i was still alive, i don't know how i fell asleep afterwards. I woke up next day before my mother and directly went to see if the dishes or anything was broken. There wasn't. But our main door was wide open which did prove that there definitely was something in my room that day.

This wasn't the first time i experienced something paranormal, even before this i believed that our house was cursed in some way. And i think this was proved by other things that i experienced while i was living there.

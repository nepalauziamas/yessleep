There was another roar from the woods outside. Much closer than the first two. It was coming for us.

"Get behind me," Mitch commanded me and Kenny. We did as we were told.

We huddled together in the center of the room. Mitch raised the .357 Magnum, pointing it at the barricaded door. "I hope this works," he said.

There was another roar, so loud it seemed to pierce my eardrums. It sounded like it was right outside the cabin. Then something clawed at the door. Then there was a pounding. The door rattled in its frame, the couch pushed in front of it shaking.  A snarl.

Mitch tensed. He cocked the revolver. He waited.

"Shoot it!" Kenny hissed at him.

"There's only six rounds. We can't waste any. We have to be sure," he answered.

The couch scooted back a couple inches as the wolf-thing started shoving the door open.

My heart felt like it was going to burst through my ribcage. I couldn't breathe. This was it.

But then the thing retreated back from the door. We could hear it stomping around outside, circling the cabin. We turned in a circle to follow it, Mitch keeping the gun aimed in front of him.

"What the fuck is it doing?" I whispered to him.

"It must know something's up," he whispered back.

I could hear its feet - or paws, or whatever the fuck they were - crunching through the dead leaves on the ground outside. It circled the cabin two or three times...then there was only silence.

"It's toying with us, hunting us," Mitch said grimly. "Trying to wait us out."

Just then the lights began to flutter.

"Oh what the fuck is *this* shit?" Kenny shouted, alarmed.

"Shit, it's the generator. Forgot all about it. Must be almost out of gas," Mitch said.

"Great," I muttered.

The lights flickered for a few minutes...then went out altogether, plunging us into darkness. Mitch took out his penlight and snapped it on. "You two stay put. I'll see if I can find some candles or a lantern or something." He began to search through the kitchen drawers.

I stood there in the dark, scared shitless and trying to make sense of the insane nightmare I had suddenly found myself inexplicably thrown into. "Kenny," I said, turning to him, "Did that girl say or do anything strange, was she acting weird before Wyatt attacked her?"

"Yeah. She started freaking out right after you guys left. She kept telling me and Wyatt to let her go or something bad was going to happen. She said she needed to take her medication before midnight."

"Medication?" I asked, confused.

"She said it was in her purse. She had to take it every night before bed. It helped suppress the symptoms of her 'condition,' whatever the fuck that meant. And she said something about how she had to get back home so her dad could take her to the 'facility' tonight because it was time for her 'annual treatment.' "

"Then what happened?" I asked him.

"Wyatt got fed up listening to her. He told her to shut the fuck up. She just kept going on and on, getting hysterical. He told me to gag her. I lifted the pillowcase to put a dishrag in her mouth, but she bit me. Then she got up and tried to run for it. That's when Wyatt went apeshit."

I felt suddenly very cold. "Wait, she *bit* you?"

"Yeah. Look..." He lit his lighter and held up his hand for me to see. For the first time I noticed there was a fresh band-aid on his index finger that hadn't been there when me and Mitch had left to get food in town. "It doesn't hurt too bad. Barely even broke the skin."

"Mitch," I called.

He come over. "What is it?"

"Kenny was bitten. The girl bit him while we in town. He might be infected."

"Hey!" Kenny snapped defensively, "what the fuck are you getting at?"

"In the movies, when someone gets bitten or scratched by one of them, they turn *into* one of them," I said.

"That's just the fucking *movies*! You don't know that for sure!" He began to back away from us, scared.

"And we don't know that you *won't*," Mitch said, looking at Kenny warily.

"That was hours ago! Don't you think if it was going to happen, it already *would* have?" he argued desperately.

"Maybe it just takes a while for the infection to spread," Mitch countered.

"Fuck you, Mitch! Look at this, both of you! He stepped back, in front of one of the windows, standing in the moonlight streaming in through the glass behind him. He pointed anxiously at his own face. "Look! It's the full moon outside! Look at my face! No fur, no fangs, no yellow eyes! It's just me, Kenny! It's just me! It's just--"

With a roar, the beast smashed through the glass behind him and seized Kenny around the waist. It snatched him outside so quickly he didn't even have time to yell in surprise.

Me and Mitch stood there, staring in numb shock. It happened in the blink of an eye. Our minds took a moment to process what we had just seen.

Kenny began to scream wildly outside. We could hear him struggling. *"Let me go! Get away from me! Let me goooooo!"*

His voice was growing fainter. It was carrying him away, deeper into the woods.

*"Noooooooo-"*

The beast roared again. Then both it and Kenny fell silent.

\*\*\*\*\*

We waited. An hour passed. Then two. I glanced at my phone. It was nearly three in the morning.

Mitch and I sat back-to-back in the middle of the room so we could keep watch on all four sides. We hadn't heard the creature since it had taken Kenny.

We waited. We were tired, and cold (cold air was pouring in through the shattered window) and scared, but we waited.

Another hour passed. Nothing happened.

"Maybe it's not coming," I said to Mitch.

"It *has* to come. It can't leave us alive, and sunrise is less than three hours away."

So we waited. And eventually, it came.

Its grand entrance was rather spectacular, but its demise was pretty anti-climatic, all things considered. There was a roar, then the creature burst through the wall, snarling and howling, and Mitch fired three carefully aimed silver-tipped slugs into its chest.

It howled in pain and collapsed to the floor, spasming. It didn't transform back into the teenaged girl before it died; she didn't look at us with gratitude now that the curse was finally broken and whisper *"Thank* *you"* before closing her eyes and dying with an expression of peace after a lifetime of torment. No,  there was none of that cliched Hollywood bullshit. Instead, it *melted.*

Before our eyes, in a matter of seconds, the beast melted, its fur and skin liquifying, until there was only an inhuman, misshapen skeleton lying in a puddle of rancid-smelling, translucent green slime.

We stood there breathing heavily, unable to believe it had ended so abruptly, that the nightmare was over.

Mitch went to the broken window and looked out at the moonlit woods, releasing a long sigh as his tension eased. "Okay," he said, turning to me, "Let's get the fuck outta--"

A second wolf beast appeared in the window. It was larger than the female, and badly maimed, one of its arms chewed away at the shoulder, large bleeding wounds covering its body, one of its yellow eyes missing.

Kenny.

Or what had *been* Kenny.

It leaped into the cabin, landing on all fours, then standing fully erect on its hindlegs.

Mitch was caught off-guard. He raised the revolver, but was a second too late. The wolf creature swiped its taloned claw down his chest, leaving deep, hideous gashes in his flesh. Then it seized Mitch and sank its jaws into his throat, shaking its head back and forth, savaging him viciously.

Mitch screamed. He dropped the .357 and it skidded across the floor, stopping right at my feet.

I grabbed the revolver, aimed, and fired once into the monster's shoulder.

It roared in pain and released Mitch, who dropped like a sack of potatoes. It spun around to face me, a primal look of rage on its face.

I fired again, hitting the beast right between the eyes. Blood and brains exploded out the back of its head. It slumped to the floor, died, and melted into a heap of bones and slime.

I lowered the gun, then ran to Mitch's side. I could see right away his injuries were mortal. His chest wound was bleeding profusely and the left side of his throat was shredded and steadily pumping blood.

"Fuck," he gasped as I knelt beside him, "he got me good."

"Don't think about it," I told him, pressing my handkerchief against his throat while trying to get him to his feet, "I'll take you to a hospital. You'll be fine."

"Fuck that. I'm done. We both know it."

"Don't talk like that, man. You're talking shit."

"You know what you gotta do. There's one bullet left. You gotta waste me."

"No fucking way, man!"

"You have to. I'm infected. When I die, I'll turn. Like Kenny."

"I can't, man. You're my fuckin homeboy." I felt the sting of tears in my eyes.

"No, I'm not," Mitch said coldly and looked at me darkly. "I was supposed to kill you."

I looked at him, confused. "Huh?"

"I was supposed to shoot you. After the guy paid. All three of you. The Russian arranged it. It was the plan. Right from the start. Make it look like you killed the girl, then shot each other in an argument. After you buried her. There's another car parked down a path, a mile behind the cabin. Plant your prints. Give the cops a neat little package. There was never going to be any payout. No ten mil. I would get paid five mil after." He looked at me intently. "And I would have done it, too."

I looked closely into his eyes and saw he was telling the truth. I had never felt such a sense of betrayal.

"You son of a bitch," I whispered.

I stood up, aimed the revolver at his head, and pulled the trigger.

\*\*\*\*\*

After the sun had risen, I went outside. I found a path behind the cabin and followed it. It led to a small lake about a mile away. I looked, but there was no second car.

I understood. I closed my eyes. "Oh God, Mitch," I groaned.

\*\*\*\*\*

There was a fifty-five gallon fuel drum behind the cabin, to supply the generator. I looked in the shed and found an old gas can. I filled it from the drum, then poured gasoline throughout the cabin. I looked through Mitch's pockets and found his Zippo. There was an inscription on it I had never noticed before: *To the World's Greatest Dad - Love, Chloe.*

I went to the doorway, flipped back the lid on the Zippo, struck it alight, and tossed it inside. The gasoline ignited with a *Whoosh!* and the flames spread rapidly across the floor. I took out my .45, wiped it clean of prints and threw it into the cabin.

I walked some distance away to watch the blaze spread. When I was satisfied that the cabin was properly aflame, I walked down the dirt road back into town. There was a bus depot on Main Street. I used cash to purchase a ticket and took a Greyhound south.

\*\*\*\*\*

I wound up in Florida. I found a job working as a bartender at a resort hotel. The pay ain't great, but it ain't bad, either, and I get by. I never got the ten mil I was promised and never saw The Russian again. I don't mind. That thing that happened last fall was a wake-up call for me. I had a moment of clarity, I guess you could say, and stepped away from a life of crime. Frankly, I'm just grateful I made it out of that mess alive. I still miss Mitch, though.

There's just one thing that keeps me up at night. One thing I dwell on when I'm trying to get to sleep, especially on nights when the moon is full.

I think about what Kenny told me the girl told him. She said her affliction was a condition. Not a gypsy curse or any of that crap; a *condition.* Maybe something genetic, something she was just born with. Could there be others like her out there? Wouldn't surprise me a bit. 

There are dark, unnatural things hiding in the corners of the world. And not all of the monsters we were scared of as kids are made up. Some of them are real.

And some might be lurking closer than you think.

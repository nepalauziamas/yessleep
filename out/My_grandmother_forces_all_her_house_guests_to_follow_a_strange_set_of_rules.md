My grandmother is superstitious.

It was only when lived with her for the summer that I realized how bad it had gotten. She had this huge freakin’ list taped to the fridge, with ten different “rules” she has to abide by.

And she was making me follow them, too.

When I opened my umbrella inside, she grabbed my arm and yanked me back. “Don’t open the umbrella inside! Didn’t you see the rules?”

“Oh, sorry. I thought those rules were, uh, just for you.”

“No. *Everyone* who lives here must obey the rules,” she said, in raspy whisper.

It made me really sad. Once Grandma Jan was sharp as a needle—a grounded, logical person who *occasionally* bought into superstitions and the paranormal. A rabbit’s foot here, a penny there. Now it seemed, in her late 80s, that part of her had grown and grown until it subsumed everything else.

With a heavy heart, I walked over to the fridge and read the rules.

1. Do not spill salt.
2. Do not open umbrellas inside.
3. Do not put on clothes inside-out.
4. Do not clip fingernails after dark.
5. Do not break any mirrors.

Mostly common superstitions, though the fingernail one was weird. I continued reading, with difficulty—her handwriting grew messier, more frenzied.

6. Do not look in the mirror while wearing black.

7. Do not whistle inside the house.

8. If you wake up to see your bedroom door open, do not close it. Likewise, if you see the attic stairs pulled down, do not push them back up.

9. Never let the refrigerator go empty. Always have enough to make an offering.

10.  Keep the curtains closed after 10 PM. Do not open them again until 6 AM.

I wanted to tell her it was a whole lot of hogwash. But then I realized it was probably a bad idea to upset her at such an old age.

“No problem, Grandma. I’ll follow the rules.”

*Yeah, right.*

She put me in the spare bedroom, down the hall from her. It was a small thing, furnished with only a twin bed and a tiny desk. But I couldn’t complain—it was either this, for free, or an apartment, for $1000+ a month.

But of course, the money wasn’t the main reason I was here. My grandma probably wouldn’t be around much longer. According to my mom, she kept getting these random bruises, and doctors were worried she had a blood disorder. And some other stuff I couldn’t pronounce. I wanted to spend all the time I could with her—she was still my grandma. Still the one that comforted me when my first cat died, still the one who taught me how to bake the most amazing snickerdoodles.

I loved her even if I had to put up with some weird-ass rules.

“I’m going to bed,” she said, as she passed by my room that night. “Sleep well, Chrissy. I love you.”

“Goodnight, Grandma. I love you too.”

I spent an hour on the internet, then put away my computer and fell asleep.

\*\*\*

I woke up a few hours later. Groaning in the darkness, I rolled over—to see my bedroom door open.

*I didn’t leave that open.* I stared at it, half-asleep, too tired to get up and close it. *Ah, well. According to the RULES, I can’t close it anyway.*

I snuggled up to my pillow and closed my eyes.

That’s when I heard the whistling.

A soft, melancholy tune. Coming from downstairs.

Every muscle in my body froze. \*That was one of the rules. Wasn’t it? No whistling inside? …So why would Grandma be whistling downstairs? At—\*I glanced at the clock—*freakin’ 2 AM?*

I pulled myself out of bed and walked into the hallway. The attic stairs had been pulled down. The darkness from the attic bled down into the hallway, along with the faint smell of rust and rotten food. Behind it, Grandma’s door hung open.

I slowly descended the stairs. “Grandma?”

The whistling stopped.

When I entered the kitchen, it was empty. “Grandma? Where are you?”

“Over here.”

I looked up to see Grandma appear from the dark family room, wearing her floral nightdress. “Did I wake you, honey? I’m so sorry. I wanted to get some milk for my heartburn.”

“No, no, it’s fine. I just thought you weren’t supposed to whistle,” I said, with a chuckle. “According to the rules...”

“You heard the whistling?” she asked, her eyes wide.

I nodded.

She grabbed my arm in a vice grip and led me back up the stairs. “Go back to sleep,” she commanded. Before I could reply, she disappeared back down the hallway—leaving my door open.

\*\*\*

“I think Grandma’s going crazy.”

“Oh, are you talking about her rules?” Mom said on the other end. “I know they’re eccentric, but she gets really upset if you break them. And the doctor… he doesn’t want us to upset her, you know?”

I sighed. “Isn’t it bad for her mental health?”

“We all go a little crazy near the end. Uncle Finley though the government was tapping all his phones in his 90s. Great-Grandma Beasley always talked about some bat following her around. Just best to let sleeping dogs lie, at this point.”

“But the rules are *so* weird, Mom. Like *really* freakin’ weird. And I woke up last night at 2 AM to find the attic stairs pulled down! I mean, what was she doing?”

“You know what?” Mom said, a bit of anger tinging her voice. “She lives by herself in that secluded little house, 365 days a year. The only socialization she gets is her weekly trip to the grocery store, and monthly visits from your dad and me. Anyone would go a little nuts under those circumstances—even you. Lay off her, okay?”

“Fine.”

So I followed the rules. I was a good girl and didn’t open any umbrellas indoors, do any whistling, or break any mirrors. Sometimes I’d wake up to see my door open in the middle of the night, but I just ignored it and left it open. A few times, when I made my way to the bathroom, I whacked my head on the attic stairs that were pulled down. Once or twice I heard the whistling again, but I ignored that, too.

Mom was right. So Grandma was a little crazy. We’re all a little crazy, aren’t we? Maybe time just scratches away all the normalcy we hide under, and we’re all batshit insane at the end.

Things were good as I accepted that reality.

Then Sunday happened.

I was watching Netflix when I heard a clink—then a shout. I threw my laptop on the bed and ran down the stairs. “Grandma!” I yelled, fearing the worst. “Grandma, are you okay?”

I found her standing over the kitchen table. Sobbing her eyes out. On the table was a salt-shaker, tipped over—next to a pile of spilled salt.

“I didn’t mean—I just was cleaning up the plates and I—I—” She could barely make cohesive sentences through the sobs.

“Sssh, Grandma, it’s okay! I’m going to clean it up, now.”

I felt awful seeing Grandma like that. She was outright sobbing, her entire body shaking, as if she feared for her life. Over spilled salt.

I brought my palm up to the table’s edge and brushed the salt into it with my other hand. I was so sad for Grandma, but I was also incredibly unnerved. Seeing someone you love, get so upset about something so trivial… it was disturbing.

“It’s all clean. See?” I said, brushing off my hands. The salt rained down into the trash. “Nothing to worry about, Grandma.”

Her sobs quieted, and she looked at me with red eyes. “But… he’ll *know*,” she said.

“What?”

“Even though you cleaned it up… he’ll still know.”

“Who?”

She looked at me. “The spirit of the house.”

“The *spirit* of the house?” Despite how skeptical I was of ghosts, spirits, and everything paranormal, I felt a shiver go down my spine. Wasn’t it legend that ghosts and spirits didn’t like salt? That if you surrounded yourself with salt, you’d be protected from them? Propagating a superstition about spilling salt could be a ghost’s defense mechanism.

If ghosts existed. Which they absolutely, positively did *not.*

That night I barely slept a wink. I stared at my ceiling as the minutes ticked by. 2 AM, 3 AM, 4 AM.

It was around 4:15 that I heard something stir.

*Thump, thump, thump.*

Soft footsteps from overhead. From the attic. Every muscle in my body froze as I listened to the steps migrate towards Grandma’s end of the house.

Then—\*creeeeaaaak—\*the metallic whine of the attic stairs being pulled down.

Followed by footsteps.

I forced myself out of bed. It took a huge, heaping serving of courage to do so, but I did. When I finally got to the door and pulled it open, the hallway was empty.

*Maybe the ghost is here, right now, staring at me. And I just don’t know it.*

*No, no, shut up! Ghosts don’t exist, you idiot!*

The back of my neck prickled with the distinct, awful feeling of being watched. But rather than run back into my own room—believe me, I really wanted to—I ran over to check on Grandma. Her door hung open, as usual. “Grandma, are you okay?”

Her bed was empty.

“Grandma? Where are you?”

That’s when I heard the soft sounds of sobbing below. I ran down the stairs, nearly slipping, and burst into the kitchen.

Grandma stood in the kitchen.

In front of her stood “the spirit of the house.”

Not some dark, ethereal specter. Not some white, translucent ghost. A man, of flesh and blood. His brown beard was unkempt and messy, his blue eyes wild. He wore tattered clothes, black boots, and a yellow-toothed grin.

“You’ve broken the rules of the house,” he whispered, stepping towards her. She flinched and took a step back.

“Please don’t hurt me,” she sobbed.

“I’m the man of the house. *I* make the rules.” Grin growing wider, he raised his hand to smack her across the shoulder.

“No!” I shouted. I charged at him. We collided and fell to the ground. Terror—and relief—washed over my grandma’s face.

“Call the police!” I shouted. “Now!”

He tried to wriggle underneath me. I grabbed the nearest thing—a chair, from the kitchen table—and smacked him as hard as I could in the head.

\*\*\*

The man was a drifter by the name of Harold McCann.

According to the police, he’d snuck into my poor grandma’s house over a year ago. They found his living space in the attic, complete with a makeshift bed over the rafters, books, and dishes that held my grandma’s leftover food. The “offerings.”

He’d slowly taken advantage of Grandma, persuading her over months to follow his “rules.” He told her he was an angry spirit of the house, and in her sensitive, mentally fragile state, she believed him. He made her swear to tell nobody of his existence. And whenever she broke the rules, he hit her.

Hence the bruises.

My poor, poor grandma.

For the time being, she’s moved in with me. We have a tiny little apartment near my college, and I’ve been helping her recover. She’s doing well. She freaked out a little when I dropped a cosmetic mirror the other day, but overall, she’s getting much better.

She even whistles inside the apartment, now—and it’s the sweetest sound I’ve ever [heard.](http://www.reddit.com/r/blairdaniels)

 The night when the contact was supposed to take place, me and some friends found out that we were going to have a seance through our discord channel, we sit down and start chatting while we fix everything needed to be able to carry out the seance. I start by turning off the light in my room, get a tealight and light it. Also takes out a necklace to be used as a pendant above the light. When we are done with everything, my friend starts asking if there is anyone in her apartment as she and her dogs have seen something.

 Her pendulum stops completely while mine starts swinging back and forth, which is very strange since I wasn't the one who asked the question. So for every question she asks I get an answer via my pendulum and my tea light now also starts to behave strangely, it starts pointing towards me and my bed. One of my friends asks if there is something in my room and as soon as she said it I got such a shiver. But since it only responded through my pendulum and I felt watched, we decided I should say goodbye, which I did and blew out the candle.

 Me and my partner have been home alone for about 1 week now, and I'm sitting down in our basement with the door open in case the cats want to come in. That's when I see it, a shadow that is about two meters. PANIC and call my partner and ask him to come home. When he gets home I tell him what I saw, but he then starts by saying it's just the cats, I'm just kidding, the cat is not two meters tall and walks on two legs.

It was time to start working again ugh really don't want to work as I have to be in hospital for 12 hours. Starting to fix myself and pack the bag with things that I need for work. I leave the house to go to the bus and then I see it again the shadow and I see it's a tall man with a hat but can't see a face. I panic again and start running. I heard someone calling me but I feel it's the shadow man calling. Finally I get to the bus and go to work.

 At work I start to wonder if maybe I just imagined it all. The hours pass and I'm on my way home, coming home to an empty house as my partner is at work. I get up and cook and the cat sits on the kitchen table, I see and hear how she starts growling at something standing next to me. I can't see anything but I feel like someone or something is staring at me. I start muttering to myself **"Please go away, go away."** I see that the cat is calm again and looks at me and meows. 

I choose to go down to the basement to sit down at the computer for a while, then I see that two of my friends are inside so I write and see if we can talk. Once they enter the canal, I ask if they have noticed anything. To add, they have no idea what I've been through. I hear the girl who had noticed things with him earlier said it's very calm, they haven't seen the person since. Finally the question comes to me if I have noticed anything, so I start by explaining everything.

 One friend says she already knew but didn't want to tell me because she didn't know how I would react. But since I've been working, we decide to talk about this tomorrow.

Okay what I am about to write now is something that I will never be able to let go of. My one friend who had sensed that there was something about me started to explain everything. **" Okay, you have an old man in a black hat, he is tall and thin with a wicked smile. He usually stands in your hall outside on the street but also in your kitchen. Your cats have also noticed him, especially Jamjam she sits right now growling at him in your kitchen."** 

I run up and I see my she sitting in a corner in the kitchen and she growls and raises a cloth. But I also see the man and now I can see his smile. I run into the kitchen and get the cat and run down to the basement again. 

My friend said that now he has started showing you his face. **"This man is very evil and he lives on your fear and arguments, the best thing you can do is think positively"** . In my mind, it's crazy how the hell I'm supposed to think positive now that I know I'm haunted by the man in the hat.

 Okay now it's been a while since I had any idea or saw the man in the hat. I guess I have started to think positively. But today something happened that makes me so sick scared. I just got home from work and decided to go in and take a nice long shower. 

Stand and put on my clothes when **I FEEL someone poking me** and if it hadn't been for the fact that my back was to the mirror I would have thought it was my partner but he is sitting in our room playing with his friends I can hear because the bathroom is wall to wall. I panic again so I grab my things and run into our room, my roommate asks me what happened and I tell them. Then I can also see how he starts to get scared, he stops playing with his friends and we go to bed to watch a movie.

 I've come home from work and sat down to eat at my computer, my partner went out on a boat with his dad so I'm alone again. I have now started to see the man in the hat again and I notice that he is getting closer and closer I don't know how this will end.. 

**The man in the hat is back**

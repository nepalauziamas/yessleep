Some good came out of my [adventure with the “possum”](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/tapukv/how_to_survive_college_dont_feed_the_opossums/) at least.  I had a story to tell at the next meeting of the Rain Chasers.  I almost didn’t go.  I was rattled after my unfortunate encounter and the warning from broom lady had me spooked.  Clearly *someone* (or multiple someones) in campus administration knows there’s some weird stuff around here and is working to keep it quiet.  It made me worry that they might also be watching the Rain Chasers.  There was that group that sat at the back of the meeting, after all.  They could be reporting back to the administration on who was getting close to real knowledge.

I think y’alls paranoia is starting to wear off on me.

The evening of the meeting rolled around and I was still in my dorm room.  I’d already finished my homework and I didn’t want to do any studying, so I was getting caught up on the anime that the anime club was watching as a group.  (yes, it’s Demon Slayer and gotta say I relate to Zenitsu the most)

(because I’m a coward)

“I thought you had a club tonight,” Cassie said as she came back from… wherever she’d been.

I dunno, it’s not like I keep track of every minute of her life, she’s clearly got friends and I don’t.  And before everyone gets paranoid (again), I’d told her before she left that I’d likely not be there when she got back so she’s not keeping track of my movements either.

“I’m not sure I want to go,” I replied.

“Okay.”

But she said it in a way that made me think she had more to say, so I paused the anime and turned around to talk to her.  Her back was to me as she hung up her jacket in her closet.

“I’m not sure going to the club is a great idea,” I said.  “It’s about the weird stuff going on around here, after all.”

“Yeah, and what’s wrong with that?  I thought you were into that sort of thing.”

“Not really,” I said reluctantly.  “It’s more like self-preservation.”

“Right, in your hometown you don’t get the luxury of being ignorant, I remember.”

We’ve talked a bit more since my last post.  I’ve kept the details about the campground sparse, just relating stories that don’t involve people dying or even being badly injured.  She doesn’t seem ready to accept the reality that the world is a lot more dangerous than most people are raised to believe.  I get that.  I might have grown up around it, but it still frightens me.  I’ve had my own sleepless nights of lying awake in bed, feeling small and scared and helpless.

I just don’t get the luxury of waking up in the morning and dismissing it as a figment of my imagination.  I *know* what’s out there.

“But it’s good to be around people you can relate to,” Cassie continued.  “You’ve said a couple times now that you’re worried you won’t make many friends here.”

“I didn’t have many friends back home,” I said quietly.  “Maybe this is just how I am.”

“Oh, bullshit!”

And she stormed over to my side of the room, flung open my closet, and started hunting for my jacket.

“Go make friends!” she said, throwing it at my face.

“But what if it’s not safe?” I asked desperately.  “I think - there’s - I think the administration knows!”

“A little bit of interest in local ghost stories isn’t going to put you on a hit list.  Besides, what’s that you said the other day?  Life isn’t safe.”

That wasn’t the message I wanted her to get out of that.  Quite the opposite, in fact.  Maybe it’s because Cassie comes from a school with a 400+ person graduating class and her world is a bit bigger than mine, but she has way more confidence than I do.  She doesn’t hesitate to share it with others, either.

Anyway, that’s how I found myself in the dorm hallway with Cassie yelling ‘have fun, be home before midnight, don’t do anything I wouldn’t do’ behind me in a falsetto fake mother voice.

I told myself that she had a point as I walked to the student union.  I could sit there and not contribute anything meaningful to the meeting.  I could listen, pretending to be there for the ghost stories and nothing more.  Keep a low profile.  And if I went in person, I further reasoned, there wouldn’t be a history of the things I said like there would be if I used the club’s discord.

The topic of the evening’s meeting was the traveling river.  One of the members was going through the geology department’s records to see if there was any reference to a river that had been filled in or dammed up, thinking perhaps it’d spawned an angry ghost river in retaliation.  Which I gotta admit is not a bad theory.  At least they didn’t go the ‘ooooo the spirits of the land are angry’ route like they’re ripping off the plot of a *certain* movie sequel that some kids I used to babysit were obsessed with.

Then I had a bright idea.  At least I hope it was a bright idea.  I stuck my hand up which I think was the nerdy thing to do because no one else was doing it but I’m insecure I guess and can’t just jump into a conversation uninvited.  Even if it seems to be a group discussion.  In a club I chose to attend.

Either way, they were considerate enough to humor me.

“I heard one of my, uh, classmates talking about the river,” I said.  “They said there were fish in it big enough to swallow people up.  Has anyone, uh, *vanished* into it?”

“That’s what the stories say,” the speaker replied with the indifferent air of someone that’s answered this question plenty of times already.  I couldn’t help but feel silly for asking.  “Someone even looked through a couple decades of obituaries from the newspaper reels and found some deaths by drowning, but not that many.”

It didn’t take that many to be indicative of inhuman involvement, I thought.  Just one or two a year.

“Are they still part of the club?” I asked.

“Nah, he’s gone.”

“Dead!?”

The speaker stared at me for a minute.

“No, he graduated.”

And then I really did feel like an idiot.  I sat there with my cheeks burning for the rest of it.  However, near the end, someone said something that I did find interesting.

“Could the river be down in the steam tunnels?” she asked.

*That* set off a lively conversation.  And I was left mostly in the dark as to what they were talking about and I didn’t dare raise my hand and ask more dumb questions.  Instead, after the meeting broke up, I decided to try my luck with the group that sat quietly in the back.  I’d started to think they were only there for the lols (or possibly as spies) except one of them did pipe up near the end with a reminder that no one should go exploring in the steam tunnels and everyone was like oh yeah sure in a way that made me think they were contributing members of the club.  Just quiet.  And being shy, I figured I’d have more luck with the quiet people.

“Hey, uh,” I said nervously as an introduction as I sidled up, “I didn’t want to ask this of the group, but what are the steam tunnels?”

“Did they not tell you during the tour?” one of the girls asked.

“I think I got the abridged tour.  This is my first semester.”

Sage nods from the group.  The guy that had spoken up earlier gestured for me to follow him to the window.  He pointed out towards a grate in the sidewalk that wafted steam in the cold evening air.

“There’s a power plant at the edge of campus,” he said.  “The university owns it.  It doesn’t produce power anymore, but instead produces steam that’s then piped through tunnels all across campus for heating.”

Well that explained the vents.  I’d seen a handful of them across campus but I had other things on my mind than wondering about them.  I figured it was just some weird city thing and turns out - it is.

“You can get into them through a number of places, including the basements of most dorms,” he continued.  “They’re easy to break into.  People say they might lead you to someplace other than where you intended… but I think people just get lost.  There’s signs to tell you where you’re at, but without landmarks it’s still hard to navigate and GPS doesn’t work down there.”

“It’s dangerous, right?  Are there things down there?”

“Yeah, hot pipes,” he said bluntly.  “And maybe not enough oxygen if there’s a leak or something.  Plus it’s stupid hot in the tunnels.  Just stay out, okay?”

Narrator voice: she did not stay out.

Look, the whole ‘you might wind up someplace other than where you intended’ made me think of sweater girl.  And I still feel *real* guilty for that one.  It was my mistake that got her into trouble.  I’m likely the only one that can get her out.  As scared as I am at the thought of it, I have to do something.

And I’m afraid that if I wait too long, I’ll start getting used to living with the guilt.

I found an entrance to the steam tunnels in the basement of my dorm.  It wasn’t labeled as such, but I could feel the heat seeping through the door.  It was secured with a deadbolt.  I didn’t even need to learn lockpicking to open it.  I just looked around a bit and found the closet with the cleaning supplies.  There was a key on a hook on the wall and when I tried it, it was the right one for the deadbolt.

I guess they don’t think students are going to go nosing about in the dorm basements.  I don’t think it’s off-limits, but there’s hardly anything of interest down there.

My plan was to go into the steam tunnels and find the exit for our neighboring dorm building.  Maybe not go through it.  I didn’t actually want to find another dimension just yet.  I just wanted to test things out, I guess.  A scouting trip of sorts.

Honestly I was just trying to work up the nerve.  I kept telling myself that it was fine, that they took *tours* down here after all, according to Cassie.  In a small part of the tunnels, perhaps, that they knew was safe.

I pried the heavy door open, bracing myself for a rush of steam to billow out at me.  Honestly, I’m not sure why I expected that.  They wouldn’t function very well as heating if they leaked steam everywhere, right?  Instead, I stared down a long, narrow hallway with thick pipes running along the top right and bottom right corners.  A wet heat rolled out, enveloping me and sweat beaded up on my brow.  The tunnel was well-lit with overhead lights, but I still had a flashlight and I clutched it tightly as I stepped inside.  I took one of the keys with me in case someone locked me in.  Then I let the door shut gently behind me and started down the tunnel.

If my estimation was correct, I’d only need to take the first right and it’d lead to the next building over.  The tunnel was quieter than I expected.  There was a faint hiss, the echo of my footsteps, and nothing else.  It felt like the world around me had frozen from the moment I entered the steam tunnels.  Like I was deep, deep underground, where humans shouldn’t go.

That’s the danger of going into the earth.  It is a passageway.  A gateway to the other side.  And perhaps you descend once into a basement or tunnel and it is fine and perhaps you descend a million times and it is fine but there is always that chance.  That one, slim chance that you’ll pass a point you didn’t expect to.

I walked for a while, until I began to wonder if perhaps I was wrong and there wasn’t a connection to the neighboring building, or if it was a more convoluted route than I thought. I moved slowly, forcing myself to take each step.  I was trembling.  It was taking all my will to not turn around and flee.

As I said earlier, I’m a bit of a coward.  I told myself over and over that they took *tours* down here.  It did little to reassure me and I crept along one painful step at a time, every bit of my senses tuned for any changes in the environment that might warn me of danger.

There was a T junction up ahead, but it felt like it was further out than it should be.  I’d turn around at the intersection, I told myself.  The guy had said there were signs down in the tunnels to tell you what street you were under.  I’d check the sign and then turn back and get my bearings with a map.

It was exactly as he said.  I took out my phone and snapped a photo.  The street name sounded vaguely familiar.  There was still a chance I could find the other building and since nothing had happened other than it being hot and a little unnerving, I felt it was too early to chicken out just yet.  This was how I talked myself into continuing on instead of turning and running back to the safety of my dorm room.

Believe me, I wanted to.  My skin had been crawling since I stepped foot in the tunnels but I couldn’t tell if that was the primitive lizard brain screaming because there really was danger out there or if it was screaming because I live in perpetual terror of what *might* be out there.

I turned right.  I walked all the way to the end where I found another door and another sign telling me it exited right where I expected it to - the other dorm.  Satisfied, I turned around to return.

Back to the intersection.  A left.  And when I turned the corner… I found myself standing in ankle-deep steam.  It seeped out from under the lower pipe and my chest felt tight, like I couldn’t breathe.  I thought of what the student had told me - how there’s not enough ventilation down here and the oxygen can get pushed out of an area by the steam.  It sounded plausible.  I didn’t think to fact check him.  But that was all that was running through my head as more steam billowed out, descending from the upper pipe.  Coughing, I backed away, stumbling over my own feet in my haste to get away.  It followed me in a growing cloud, obscuring the hallway in fine white vapor, and I raised an arm to protect my face, shocked by how fast it had expanded.  It scalded my bare skin and the sudden flash of pain spurred me into action.  I had to get away - before the pipe exploded or I suffocated or or or *something.*

I turned right again, planning to escape out into the other dorm.  But that corridor was choked with steam as well, so thick that I couldn’t see anything but a cloud of vapor.  My mind reeled.  I hadn’t *heard* anything.  It was just like one minute the tunnel was clear and the next it was filled with a rapidly expanding cloud of steam.

Then I saw something that froze me in my place.

There was a face in the steam.  A human face.  A human hand, reaching out towards me.  The mouth swung open as if to scream and what came out was a hiss, loud enough to be a shriek, and the cloud roiled towards me like an ocean wave, crested by that screaming face and that hand stretched out with fingers splayed.

There was only one direction that was clear of steam.  I turned around and ran, sucking in that hot, moist air in desperate gasps, like my lungs couldn’t expand far enough to take in the oxygen that my body needed.  Like the fear was a rope around my chest, crushing it in on itself.  I didn’t *dare* look behind me.  At some point I dropped the flashlight and I left it where it fell.  I felt the heat on my back and that was enough to spur me forward, running as hard as I could down the narrow tunnel.  My footsteps echoed, bouncing off the walls.

I turned a corner.  There was an intersection up ahead.  I slowed long enough to glance down the side corridors.  There was a chemical smell coming from one of them.  It was a familiar scent, but my thoughts were too scattered to process it.  At the end of the other one I saw a door.  I ran for it.  I couldn’t read the sign anymore, as my glasses were fogged over with moisture and I only saw shapes and blurs through a gray haze.  My hair was plastered to my brow with sweat.

All thoughts of sweater girl had been driven from my mind.  My only goal was escape as I fumbled with the door.

Locked.  Of course.  Desperately, my breath coming in sharp, panicked gasps, I fumbled with the key, praying they were all the same.

It was.  The door unlocked.

And then a hand closed on the back of my neck.

I threw myself through as the door swung open before me.  I landed on the cement floor beyond, the cold air a shock running through me after those sweltering tunnels, and I rolled over onto my back to frantically kick the door shut.

The tunnel behind me was empty.  No steam.  No human face.  No human hand.

I slammed the door shut anyway.  Locked it.  And then, shaking, I hunted for some stairs and an exit and emerged into the cold early spring air outside one of the campus halls a short distance from my dorm.

It took a few hours to work up the nerve to go back into the basement to return the key.  I didn’t want to even *approach* the door to the steam tunnels.  I walked toward it warily, as if I expected it to burst open and that steam to pour out, stretching out its hand to grab hold and drag me back into the tunnel with it.  But nothing happened while I fumbled with the keys with shaking hands.  Then, in my messy attempts to lock it, I realized that there was no need.

It was already locked.

Someone had been down here in the short time I was in the tunnel and locked it.

Panicked, I hurried to the supply closet and replaced the keys on the hook.  Did they notice they were gone?  They must have their own set.

But whoever it was, they somehow realized the door was unlocked.

Back upstairs, I checked the back of my neck in the mirror.  It hurt like a bad sunburn.  There was a red mark there - not a burn, thank goodness.  Just a spot where the steam had scalded me.

Scalded me in the exact imprint of a human hand.

I’m not sure how I’ll work up the courage to go back into the steam tunnels.  And if you’re reading that like uh Ashley obviously you *don’t*, well… I think my hunch was right.  I think this is where I’m going to find sweater girl.  Because you know that weird smell coming from one of the corridors?  I finally placed what it was.

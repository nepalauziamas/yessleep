"Billy!" A skinny boy perked up at Mrs. May's call. "Be a good boy and take care of Henry on his first day, would you?" 

"Sure thing, Mrs. M!" 

The kid, Billy, stood and extended a hand to me in greeting. He gestured to the vacant desk beside his and I gratefully sank into the attached seat. 

So far, the boarding school had a completely different vibe to the generic public one I was accustomed to. There wasn't any jeering or excessive disruptions and everyone listened to the teacher respectfully.

Billy himself was all smiles, and somehow managed to bring my rampant nerves under control with an infectious enthusiasm. I couldn't see how anyone could possibly think him lame or weird, so I immediately had him pegged as a popular kid even despite his patchy clothes. 

As if to prove my point, one of the bigger kids came over to rest an arm around Billy's shoulder. 

"Hey, new kid!" He addressed me with a wave. "It was Henry, right? Nice to meet you. My name's Johnny but my friends call me JJ."

I eeked out a greeting, trying my best to sound cool and laid back. I seemed to have done alright because JJ smiled before turning to Billy.

"You looking forward to the game later Bill?" 

Billy grinned from ear to ear. "You bet I am! I can't wait!"

"Are you part of a team or something?" I asked.

JJ ruffled Billy's sandy hair. "Are you kidding? He's the star player!" 

Everyone within earshot laughed at that, so I thought it best to laugh along with them. Not wanting to seem like I didn't get the joke. 

"See you out there." JJ returned to his seat. 

A few minutes before the bell was set to ring for lunch, Mrs. May dismissed Billy and I. 

"You ought to have a head start since it's your first day," she told me.

We grabbed our bags and slung them over our shoulders, but as I got up to leave I noticed a change in atmosphere. The room was deathly silent. 

I paused at the door and glanced back. There wasn't a soul in the classroom that wasn't staring directly at Billy. 

If he noticed, he didn't show it. He was already walking briskly down the hall and whistling the tune of some upbeat theme song. I caught up and asked him about the stares. 

"Oh, you'll see," was all he said.

Billy showed me around the cafeteria and even offered me some tips and tricks to get more food out of the dinner ladies. When the bell rang and a storm of shoes echoed through the corridors, Billy led me to the edge of a huge field at the rear of the school.

"Come on, I'll show you where we play the game!" He called back to me as he jogged up ahead. Whatever this game was, he seemed very excited to play. I had my fingers crossed for soccer. 

When we reached the center of the field, Billy stopped and faced back towards the school. I couldn't make out any markings to indicate any sort of playing field.

I felt the footsteps vibrate up though the dirt before I heard them, and turned to see what must have been every student in attendance marching toward us. 

"Seriously," I said, intimidated by the sight. "What is this game?" 

Billy seemed giddy with anticipation when he looked at me. "I do hope you join in." 

JJ headed the pack. As soon as he stepped into range he wrapped both hands around Billy's neck and flung him hard to the ground. I shouted in protest and tried to position myself in between them but a dozen kids had already circled the pair, blocking me out completely.

Through gaps in the crowd I watched the scene unfold. JJ was repeatedly bringing his foot down on my new friend with a primal glee in his eyes, and the spectators stared down at Billy with a hunger. Drinking in the view. A younger girl broke free of the circle with a sharpened pencil raised to the sky. She swung it in a downward arc, burying it straight in Billy's eyeball. 

I'd seen enough. I fought back bile as I picked my way through the crazed horde and scanned the horizon for a teacher.

I spotted Mrs. May's tight gray bun bobbing in the distance, and waved my arms to grab her attention.

"Over here!" I yelled. 

She tore right by me, bullied a path through the onlookers, and promptly stamped her boot heel into Billy's skull, splitting it like a coconut.

The bag slid from my shoulder as I sank to my knees. The 'game' continued for a while, though I couldn't see much of it after the gap carved by Mrs. May quickly filled up. 

When the crowd finally dispersed, Billy was nothing more than a pile of torn clothes and a chunky red splatter soaking the grass. JJ stopped when he reached me, panting lightly as if from a brief workout.

"You have to try it out tomorrow. I know, it's fucked up at first but... Just trust me."

I flinched as he patted me on the back and left. A disheveled Mrs. May approached next.

"Don't worry Henry," she smiled in a way that I'm sure she thought was comforting. "I'll keep letting you out before the bell until you're ready to join in. Come on, let's head back."

I wanted to tear free of the vice-like grip she had on my upper arm as we walked back to the school, but I wasn't confident enough in my ability to scale the spiked fence in time. If that was what they did to kids for fun around here, I dreaded to think what a punishment looked like.

The rest of the day passed by in a blur. Everyone I met was painfully nice to me, there wasn't a single altercation to speak of, and nobody mentioned what happened at lunch. When night fell, I found myself staring up at the dark mattress above me, seriously doubting my recollection of events.

Billy was back the next day. 

A few more patches had been stitched onto his clothes, but aside from that there wasn't a blemish on him. I just stared, dumbstruck, as he sidled into the seat next to mine and smiled like he'd returned from a short outing. 

Again, Mrs May dismissed us before the bell rang, and again the students swarmed Billy on the field to smash his smiling face in. 

Some days he didn't make it that far. Once, JJ jammed a ballpoint pen between Billy's shoulder blades in the middle of class, and the rest of the students fell upon him like a shoal of feasting piranha.

Even as they played tug of war with his limbs, Billy laughed and urged me to join in. "Come on Henry, look how much fun everyone's having!" 

It was like a nightmare I couldn't wake up from. But then, I had to admit, there was something about the ruthless brutality of it all that I couldn't seem to tear my eyes from. Something strangely satisfying.

Yesterday, JJ held Billy in position in front of me.

"Come on," he urged. "Just press your thumbs into his eyes real quick, it'll feel *amazing*."

Billy nodded frantically in his arms, but I managed to refuse once again.

At night I find myself dreaming of it. Of how exhilarating it must feel to be the one to make his body break and burst along the seams, and all the different ways I could make that happen. 

I don't think I'll be able to resist tomorrow. I don't know if I want to. So please, I'm begging anyone who reads this...

*Talk me out of it.*

My father, sometimes in a drunken rage, would often tell me that a man’s true self is revealed when no one is watching. Now that I spend my life alone, I suppose I am my true self all of the time. At least, that’s what I believed until recently.

Now, I know that I am not alone. I am being watched.

It started as creaks in the attic a few weeks ago, something I attributed to mice, maybe a barn owl. Even one night when I heard two loud thumps from just above my bed, I wrote it off as the house settling, or perhaps the mice knocking over some dusty family heirloom.

I might have ignored the sounds, but over the next few days, I began to notice additional evidence of an intruder. First, I’m meticulous in my wine consumption, always sure to consume no more than half a bottle in a given night. As such, I always draw a careful line in Sharpie on the label, making sure I don’t exceed my limit. A week ago, however, I discovered a bottle on the kitchen counter, its contents well short of the line.

I called both the police (who took a brief report over the phone but neglected to send a squad car) and the local locksmith, who happily changed the locks on all of my doors. I also installed some wireless cameras equipped with motion detectors in several corners of the house.

I slept soundly that night, my phone by my bed primed to alert me if the motion detectors tripped. I awoke to find my wine downstairs completely gone. I immediately reviewed the footage of the night before.

At first, nothing seemed to move at all, but as I watched more carefully, I detected the slightest dance of light and shadow moving through the house. The smear of light descended the attic ladder, and moved slowly through the hall, stopping to examine the family portraits that lined the spiral staircase on the way to the kitchen. From there, it moved to my bookcase, plucked a volume from the shelf, and took it to a nearby chair, where it stayed for several hours leafing slowly through pages.

Finally, the smudge moved to the kitchen, drinking directly from the bottle until it was empty.

The bottle empty, the smear ascended the stairs and walked to my bedroom door, turning the handle ever so gently. Finally, it walked slowly to the foot of my bed. For perhaps ten minutes, it waited there, watching me sleep.

I generally consider myself to be a level-headed type.

Once, after a car accident that completely destroyed my vehicle and left the other driver and his entire family dead, the police mistook me for a bystander due to my calm demeanor. Perhaps it was due to some kind of shock, but I’d more aptly attribute it to my temperament. Things generally just don’t phase me.

This intruder, though, was different. Like a storm surge swelling some long-forgotten wound, the apparition’s descent from the attic stirred an emotion I hadn’t felt since my early youth: fear.

You see, as a rule, I avoid the attic.

As a boy, I spent a few long afternoons up there on rainy Oregon days. A treasure trove of ancient family heirlooms awaited me up there, dating back to pioneer days. Packed in trunks I discovered ancient, chipped sets of porcelain cups, and a chess set carved of black and white rocks along with a rotting board.

Then, as I rooted through dusty crates, moth-eaten carpets, and portraits of long-dead relatives,, I came across an ancient grandfather clock, its hands both stuck eternally at exactly ten o’clock. Though the hands were stuck in time, the pendulum continued to swing, its tick-tock as steady as a sleeper’s heartbeat.

The clock towered over me, reaching nearly all the way to the attic roof. Its body was built of delicately crafted wood inlay, dark cherry running in tight geometric patterns that curved into themselves, forming tiny fractals, the wood growing so thin in places that it seemed impossible any human carpenter could have built it.

Strangest of all, near the base, a metal plate bore strange, runic letters that I couldn’t decipher. Below these, followed a list of names, numbers, and dates:

Robert Brown, 7: Dec. 1, 1692 - Jan. 15, 1705

Daniel Brown, 8: Jan. 15, 1705 - Sep. 7, 1751

Jedediah Lewis, 4: Sep. 10, 1751 - Sep. 12, 1751

Edna Lewis, 9: Sep 12, 1751 - Dec. 25, 1800

John Lewis, 5: Dec. 25, 1800 - April 18, 1820

The list continued through the years until it reached familiar names:

Franklin Walker, 11: Jan 1, 1930 - April 11, 1950

Jane Walker, 5: April 11, 1950 - May 16, 1980

Samuel Walker, 10: May 16, 1980 -

These were my great-grandfather, grandfather, and father. The end dates were those of their deaths. The start dates weren’t their births but seemed to be something else, sometimes the death of a spouse, sometimes a parent. The other numbers didn’t seem to follow any pattern whatsoever, though notably, my father’s number matched that of the clock.

I might have investigated the clock further if my father hadn’t discovered me up there. Though almost sober for once, he flew into a rage, picking me up as if I were a straw doll and nearly throwing me down the ladder. When we were back downstairs, he turned to me with wild eyes and told me never to go into the attic again. Through his usual anger, though, I sensed something different. A deep and inexplicable fear.

“There are things up there,” said my father after a few seconds. “Things a boy shouldn’t see. Probably things a man shouldn’t see either, not that any of us have a choice. Your day will come, of course. But you may as well not rush it. No need for you to go finding trouble. The Traveler will find you soon enough.”

He poured a scotch glass almost full and gulped it.

“How old are you?” he asked.

“Twelve, sir.”

He handed me the glass, an inch of scotch still sloshing around the bottom.

“A man soon enough,” he said, as I took my first sip. “But stay out of the attic if you know what’s good for you. Basement, too, as long as I mention it. And always sleep with your door locked.”

He retrieved the glass from my hand and waved me away. I agreed not to return to the attic and kept my word as long as my father lived.

The morning after I reviewed the video footage of the intruder, I dressed in my oldest jeans and t-shirt, and opened a fresh bottle of scotch for added courage. As usual, I carefully applied a small black line in sharpie a few fingers beneath the top of the bottle, not that such measures seemed to matter anymore, but such is the force of habit.

It had been nearly thirty years since my last ascent into the attic. As I reached the pull cord to the attic, I felt suddenly small again, as if I’d traveled back in time to my boyhood. The chord seemed to lurk just out of reach.

I took a running start and grabbed it, pulling the ladder down as cold air poured down from above.

I ascended slowly, a flashlight in hand. Its beam illuminated floating cities of dust, and great cobweb kingdoms. It seemed that this was not my house, but rather the spiders' and rats’ domain. As I hoisted myself onto the creaking floorboards, skittering feet and black tails retreated into dark corners and behind dusty ottomans.

“Hello?” I called out.

*“Hello?”* came the faint echo of my own voice.

Around me, dust covered the floor like freshly fallen snow. A line of footsteps led into the darkness beyond. Even before I shined my flashlight at the far wall, I knew where they’d lead.

My skin bristled at the touch of webs as I made my way toward the ancient clock. I flicked a spider from my chest. How long had it been since I’d been touched by another living thing?

Finally, I reached the clock. For the most part, it remained unchanged. Somehow, the pendulum had continued to swing on through the years despite a lack of winding. Brushing a layer of dust from the face, I noticed the first difference: both hands now pointed at seven, rather than ten. I searched my memory, searching for some fault, but–no. Certainly, they’d pointed to ten before. I tapped at the clock face, testing for any sign of looseness, but the hands stayed firmly in place.

Then, I looked down at the metal plate at the clock’s base. All of the old names were there, stretching back through the centuries, but now I saw an update:

Franklin Walker, 11: Jan 1, 1930 - April 11, 1950

Jane Walker, 5: April 11, 1950 - May 16, 1980

Samuel Walker, 10: May 16, 1980 - Dec. 21, 2000

Stephen Walker, 7, Dec. 21, 2000 -

My name had now joined the others, starting from the day my father died.

In the hours after this discovery, I broke my usual sharpie rule and drew a second line, drinking another day’s allotment. And then a third.

My mind raced. Had my father somehow paid an engraver to make the alterations in the time after I last visited the attic? If so, had he somehow known the date of his own impending death? Surely not. He had certainly not seen it coming.

But what other explanation could there be? Had some unbeknownst third party snuck in and added the changes without my knowing? And what motivation could they possibly have for doing so?

I walked to my father's study (indeed, I still thought of it as his) and pulled a family portrait from the wall to reveal his safe. Inside, I removed his small, black handgun and carefully loaded it. If any answers were to be found, it was clear the Smear would have them.

Tonight, there would be no sleep. Tonight there would be a conversation.

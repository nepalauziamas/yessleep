I've always been a introvert and hate going outside and especially in the dark. I woke up and played games on computer, in my basement when my friend called asking if I wanted to play some Minecraft, and I said sure so I boot up Minecraft, and went on discord and got in to a vc with him, then I got into the server and when mining with him then he asked, What is that scratching noise. I immediately paused I was home alone all that week and I checked the window but nothing was there. I went back and said I didn't find anything. So we just got back to playing Minecraft. Then he said he had to leave so I said goodbye, then I started working on the world but I passed out.




It was 12 o'clock in the morning when I woke up and the the first thing I noticed was that the bathroom door was on and I had it closed all night but I thought nothing about it and made myself so pancakes and I went to do my chores. When I was done with all my work and it 6:25pm so I went to play some Minecraft. I lost track of time because went I looked at the time it was 3:05am but I continued playing Minecraft till I heard something out side I went upstairs and looked out the window and the shed door was opened and the padlock was brutally cut up in pieces I was scared and I went into my room and fell asleep in there.




It was the next day and I went to go check to see what happened with the shed but to my surprise the door was closed and the padlock was on it and intact with no signs of someone trying to get in. I decided to forget about it and went to play some more games till it 6pm then I ordered a pizza and watched a movie but the at 8pm I got a call from my mom saying so and my dad would come home tomorrow  and I said ok and hung up at 2:45am I heard a knocking on the door and I went up to the door to find a bloody trail going to my backyard and for some dumb reason I followed it and it went to my shed and to my horror the padlock to the shed was nowhere to be found. Then I heard a creeking in there I was so scared but I opened the door and to my horror someone with a axe came charging at me and I started to run and I got into my house and locked door and I went to call the cops but he broke though the window.







I woke up in the hospital with a huge cut down my leg, then my mom and dad saw I was awake and came to me and said are you ok and I said I'm fine but my leg hurted so bad then I said what happened and they said that they got home and called my name but I didn't answer so the they went downstairs and saw my cut up leg and then they called the cops, and then they came and one went to the open door shed and saw someone in there with an axe so he tased he and put him in handcuffs. I asked who it was and it was dad's exboss and that he got him fired so he was trying to get revenge on him by killing me. But I am now safe as he is in jail. So after a day in the hospital I went home and watch a movie with my mom and dad.

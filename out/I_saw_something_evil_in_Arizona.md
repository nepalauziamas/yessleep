And so did my ex husband. 

My ex husband, Dan and I are from California. We moved to Tucson, AZ for 8 years because he was stationed there in the USAF and we just ended up staying because it was cheaper to live there than it was to live in California. We would go back to San Diego to visit family, and this time my cousin Nick and Dan’s sister Samantha were coming back to Tucson with us for a visit. Samantha brought her own car and Nick rode in it with her. Dan and I were in our car.

The drive between San Diego and Tucson is pretty long, and for much of it there isn’t a lot to see, especially if you’re traveling at night, which we were. 

Samantha wanted to sleep so we pulled over and Nick took over driving. Their car was behind ours. 

It was very dark outside, there are no lights on the road, it really is just highway in the dark at this point with our headlights being the only source of illumination.

I’m in the passenger seat. I feel fine, maybe kind of bored and just ready to be home. 

What I’m about to describe is hard for me to put into words. I’ve never seen anything like it before or since. Multiple people are involved and there’s been no way for me to reconcile the event and for the last 9 years it has bothered me. On occasion I lay awake at night and cry because it just terrifies me that there is no good explanation, no solution, and it could be happening to anyone in some way with fatal results.

Up ahead there is a greenish mist that appears to be streaking towards the windshield, leaving a trail behind it. I don’t feel alarmed, I just keep watching it. It quietly hits the windshield and wraps around my side of the car, and when it’s passing my passenger window it looks like a stretched out face that keeps stretching as it is passing my window and I lose eyes on it once it has passed and gone behind us. I do not feel good about what I saw but I suppose it could have been a trick of my eyes because we’ve been on the road so long and it’s been so dark outside. 

Seconds later Dan says “what the fuck”, kind of quietly. I ask him what’s wrong but he’s pretty focused on his rear view and side mirrors. Nick, who was in the car behind us with a sleeping Samantha is pulling up fast and getting in the other lane to pull up beside us. When their car is parallel with ours, he tries to run us off the road, multiple times. Nick is leaning towards Samantha’s passenger window to look at us while this is happening except it’s not nicks face. It’s the green shit from outside, with its face stretching and contorting in place of nicks face. It did look like it was coming through nicks face, if that makes any sense. Some of his face structure was present but it was mostly lost to whatever the fuck the green stuff was. Samantha’s seat was recline all the way back so that she could sleep and she didn’t seem awake at all, we couldn’t see her. So nick and the green stuff were leaning over her and she didn’t wake up during the confrontation between our cars. 

After “Nick” attempted to run us of at least twice he sped off ahead of us and we slowed down to a stop. After a round of us saying “what the fuck” I asked Dan if he saw it. He did. After a few minutes Nick and Samantha came back to where we were parked. Nicks as back to himself but he seemed shaken and confused. I don’t know what brought him back, when Samantha finally woke up, or what happened in those few minutes with them when they were off ahead and Dan and I were alone. 

Samantha was just mad about not being able to get rest and now having to drive again because Nick now said he was too tired to drive and Dan and I didn’t want him to drive anymore anyway. Samantha didn’t seem aware of anything that had just happened. She was frustrated that we were all acting crazy in her eyes with how upset we were over something she didn’t believe happened. 

I could get into how the event made us feel, what we talked about afterwards but it’s emotionally exhausting, I’m honestly tired of feeling it, I wish I could forget it. I’m posting this because I want to know if anyone else has specifically seen what I described.

I know people on the internet lie, want to be a part of something, convince themselves of shit and I understand anyone could lie to me to relate. That’s why I haven’t posted about this in the 9 years since it happened. But it’s bothering me still so I’m just shooting in the dark here.

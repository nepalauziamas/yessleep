Things have gotten far worse at the antique store. Far, far, far worse.

The dark tar-like drip has become a steady trickle. I’m emptying each bucket every 30 minutes. So I’ve barely slept, and bailing it out the window has killed the grass below.

The monster sightings are getting much more frequent. And they’re not just wandering around aimlessly. They’re actively searching for something, and that something seems to be inside the antique store.

But none of those issues compare to the worst; Jess is gone.

And it all started with one of the many odd jobs she pushed on me.

This time it wasn’t feeding Geico, the taxidermy crow. No, this time I was polishing the mirror in the room under the stairs. Which is a term Jess – much like the polish – applied liberally.

In reality, I was smearing black boot polish as thick as I could over the surface of a full-length mirror. Jess was adamant.

“Ice that bad boy like cake,” she’d said.

It was my last job of the day and, I’ll admit, I may have been in a hurry. The drip hadn’t started its trickle at this point, but I knew it was only a matter of time.

In my hurry, I wiped when I should have smeared. And the eyes staring back at me through the mirror weren’t my own. They were tired, and almost certainly a colour. The face was masculine, and one I’d never seen before; yet familiar, and uncanny, and alien.

The glass fogged. And I thought I’d – maybe – dodged a bullet.

But then I watched as the tip of a finger traced a message in the fog.

*WHO ARE YOU?*

After confirming there was no one else in the room, I answered, “I’m Chris.”

The person on the other side of the mirror shook his head, and then tapped on the glass. And that made for yet another embarrassment, screaming away in the back of my mind, to revisit years later.

“Oh.”

I breathed on the glass and wrote,

*CHRIS. WHO ARE YOU?*

There was a faint, squinted strain in his eyes as he read. But of course there would be, he was reading backwards. The glass fogged. And something suddenly felt wrong. It was that same feeling I’d felt many, many days ago when I’d first woken up here. My stomach was being twisted like a Rubik’s Cube, and I had no idea why.

*GO GET JESSICA.*

It dawned on me. This mirror man was writing from the other side of the mirror. His messages should have been reversed. But they weren’t. And those eyes were tired, and almost certainly a colour, and so very, very familiar.

I breathed on the glass and wrote,

*WHY?*

But my arm was suddenly heavy. So, goddamn, heavy. And every muscle screamed.

I looked back into the – literally – indescribable eyes of the man in the mirror before the glass fogged once more.

*NOW.*

He wrote.

Was he… threatening me? My vision was getting fuzzy, my eyes felt cold and glassy. Why? How?

It was clear he couldn’t leave. If he could, he’d just go and get Jess himself. And it was also just as clear there was a reason why Jess had me block this mirror every afternoon. The one thing that wasn’t clear was what that reason was… unless…

Was it the man in the mirror that’s dangerous? Or, was it the mirror itself?

With that realisation came a wave of fatigue unlike anything I’d ever felt. And my body, for the first time, failed me. My knees buckled, the muscles in both arms were burning, and keeping my eyes open was like a staring contest with the sun; every sense of reason in my body was telling me to close them.

I didn’t feel the fall until I was halfway down. My arms were too heavy, and too slow. I fell face-first into the wall and… through the wall.

Into what I can only call a starless night.

The other side of the wall was a darkness that bled. Bled into light, bled into flesh, bled into the mind. The fatigue was far worse now. Consciousness was bleeding. The adrenaline of the fall was the only thing keeping me awake. But even that was numbed by the vast emptuy. I could feel nothing. And I don’t mean I couldn’t feel anything, I could *feel* an infinite nothing. It wasn’t hot, it wasn’t cold. It wasn’t wet, it wasn’t dry. It wasn’t rough, it wasn’t soft.

It was nothing made manifest.

And I realised, this is what lurked behind the eyes in the mirror. At the time my brain had censored it out, but this was it. A starless night, an infinite nothing, eclipsed by a shadow far, far, far to the right and somehow distinct in the inky black.

Something grabbed my legs, and the sensation of feeling was enough to send a spasm all the way to the tips of my fingers. I could feel them, my legs. And then my stomach, sliding on the floorboards. And then I was back in the antique store. Jess was standing over me, the entire front of her shirt slick with black polish.

“There’s someone here to see you,” she said.

My mind was a dense forest fog, but even I knew that didn’t sound right.

“What? Like, a customer?” I asked.

She shook her head, the dim light in the room burned my eyes.

“Then who is it?”

“He said his name’s Bundy.”

That name was all I needed to snap out of whatever daze I’d been in.

“He’s in the store?” I lowered my voice, “Right now?”

She must have sensed the urgency, because she lowered her voice to a faint whisper, “Yes?”

“And he said his name was Bundy?”

“Yes. He said you’d know exactly who he is, and why he’s here.”

“Did you tell him I’m here?”

“I said I’d go find you.”

“Great,” I closed my eyes and tried to think, “Ok. Go tell him I’m not here.”

It was hard to see her face in the blinding dim light, but I could see her arms were crossed.

“Not until you tell me what’s going on Chris.”

Her fingers drummed against her arm impatiently.

“Jess, please.”

“I don’t think you understand-”

“I won’t ask why the guy in the mirror has your eyes.”

Her fingers stopped drumming, her jaw clenched.

“I don’t care what you think you know, Chris.”

And she was right. What I knew was of no consequence to her. She held all the cards. This was her store. This was her home. I was here because she hadn’t cast me out, and I wasn’t entitled to her help.

“Jess, please.”

I was pathetic.

“Fine,” she sighed, “But when I come back, we have to talk.”

She left me in the room beneath the stairs, next to a wall drenched in black boot polish. I could hear the argument, but I chose not to listen. I tuned it out. The shouting. The smash. The slam of the front door. And for the first time since arriving, I wished the crash had killed me.

This went beyond bad news. I already knew Bundy had figured out where I was. But he could enter the store. Then again, of course he could. Because I could too.

It was a full hour before Jess came back to the room beneath the stairs, and she wasn’t happy.

“Who the fuck was that?!” she yelled.

This was the first time I heard her swear. And it spoke volumes.

“Somebody that I used to know,” I shrugged

“No. *No.* Fuck you,” she fired, “Who the fuck was that?”

I should’ve come clean and told her everything. About me, about Bundy, about the mine, and why the attic now drips dark and tar-like. But I just held up my hands in mock surrender.

“I wish I knew, Jess. He’s just some guy who used to show up around my van.”

“Your van?”

“Yes.”

“In Halmere?”

“Sure.”

The fury in her eyes wasn’t gone, but there was something else welling up from the depths. It was a look I knew all too well, a look I’d seen on far too many people I cared about, and the reason I thrash in my sleep. It was the look of absolute betrayal.

“Chris. Think about that for a second.”

I was silent, praying on the flats she wouldn’t come to the conclusion I knew she would.

“What you’re saying doesn’t make any sense. You’re… You’re…”

“Not from Halmere,” I came clean.

A silence hung in the air, but the heaviness of that silence was nothing compared to the guilt. Because now Jess knew, and now I had to act.

“How did he know you were here?” she broke the silence.

It wouldn’t matter soon anyway.

“This isn’t the first time I’ve seen him here.”

She didn’t look surprised, “How long ago was the first?”

“It was the day after my first post…” I trailed off, realising the mistake I’d just made.

“Your first what?”

Telling her wouldn’t change what had to be done.

“My first post.”

“About this place?” she asked.

“About this place,” I confirmed.

“By first, you mean…”

“There are a few.”

She fell silent, nodding away to a conversation we were no longer having.

Everything was my fault. And it was time to take responsibility.

It was time to show Jess why the attic drips, dark and tar-like.

“Do you write everything in those posts?”

Her question caught me off guard. I couldn’t say a word. I couldn’t move an inch. The cold sweat of consequence was potent.

She gave me a trembling smile, “Can I show you something Chris?”

Nothing she had to show was going to change what had to happen, but I nodded.

“We’ll need to go down.”

She flicked the carpet up beneath us. Framed in the floorboards was a wooden door identical to the one at the store entrance. A hatch to the cellar.

She led the way down, down, down the candlelit curling concrete stairs beneath the hatch. Neither of us spoke. My silence was one I couldn’t bear to break. Hers was calm and contemplative.

The cellar was a scene taken straight from the streets of Pompeii, but twisted. It was a cave, full of petrified shapes that used to be people. All of them crawled. Some clawed. Others reached for the well in the dead centre of the room. A morbid candelabra, each body carried candles. In their mouths, their eyes, and in their hands. The wax dripped like tears down every face.

Jess wasn’t facing any of it though. She stared directly into my eyes.

“Do you write *everything* in those posts?” she asked.

The back of my throat was dry and prickly. The words wouldn’t come out.

But she smiled.

“No worries.”

And fell backwards into the well.

“Jess!” I yelled after her.

But Jess was gone, lost forever in the darkness of the well. There was no splash. No crack as her head hit the ground. No thud as her lifeless body bounced like a sack of potatoes. And no scream.

Something inside me was flooded, and then drained just as quickly. And I realised why. I was grateful. Grateful that Jess had saved me the effort. Grateful I hadn’t had to get my hands dirty. Grateful that she wouldn’t have to see what comes next.

I left the antique store’s basement, and the tar-like drip had become a trickle.

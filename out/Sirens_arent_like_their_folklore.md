I work as an investigator of sorts. I research old mysteries and piece them together for whatever reason I've decided. For fun,someone asked me,or it's for a crime of sorts. I should also take the time to tell you I am not in a big corporation of sorts. My income is off of police stations who are trying to solve a crime or someone who wants an in depth story about a mystery in their local town. 

This is how I met Terrance. Terrance had emailed me to research a story of their hometown,which was coincidentally my hometown as well. A small place in Lithuania. We discussed old places there,places we hadn't seen in awhile. We fondly discussed the place,which is how I found we went to the same school as well. 

After talking for awhile they sent me what they wanted to me to research. The case of Lorelai Humming. Lorelai was from a family in Scotland then moved to Lithuania. She spent most of her formative years in Scotland before her move to Lituania. 

There were a few things about her. One was an article of her successful career as a Author,another was a story of her death. One of an investigation on her death,and the last was a translated version of her diary. 

The one of her death was simple and short,it read.
"Famous writer Lorelai Hummings was found dead on the shore of a local beach," as you can guess,the investigation on her death was more plentiful with information.

What it included were things closely written like this.

"Lorelai Humming after being on the shoreline of Palanga was brought in for an autopsy. The results of it were shocking. 

Some might've guessed she drowned to death but the reports say it was likely a mixture of blood loss and disease. Along with various signs of blunt force trauma. 

An investigation was let out to find out the real truth of her death and most of their information has come back unirrevalent. Though there is few information that is considered precious for the case.

A bartender says she was at their bar with a few friends. The bartender,in exact words said, "Lorelai had been off the entire night,at some point leaning toward one of her friends and whispering something with a grim look." They then say she left after that with that same friend. 

A person who was at their lighthouse says they swear they saw the rough figure of a single person holding a human sized thing in the water before letting go. 

A florist saw from behind various bushes of flowers they had grown two figures,one slouching and one rowing,boating into the ocean. 

This is all the information they have seemed to collect that is valuable. We still are not exactly sure the full story but we will report back to this article when we get a hard idea of it."

Then the diary. I decided I had plenty of time and wanted to get more things done before I read it because it was roughly 167 pages long. 

The day after I woke up I felt a settle off-ness. My chest felt heavier but only slightly. I walked and and took a shower. A slight feeling of dread in me. I walked about my day feeling this way. I felt uncomfortable for no reason at all. I have no history of anxiety and I don't drink and anxiety inducing drinks.  So I had no reason to feel this way. I remember remarking this to my friend who laughed it off to something stupid. He made fun of me for the rest of the day but I couldn't care less. I wish he would've been right. 

The next day rolled around and I felt no different. My chest felt heavy,which I ignored. I walked around my house feeling overly heavy. I felt hot and sweaty,I felt anxious and worried. I did various things to keep my mind off of it. I started different hobbies and I did various meditations and heard countless "Music for relaxing," sounds. At some point I got fed up and thought about it. Multiple times throughout the day I swore I could feel myself on the brink of anxiety. I thought of why. I was not reading anything too realistic to be a creepypasta. I hadn't listened to true crime or,or horror stories. I thought about it harder and realized it wasn't what I was thinking,it was what I was doing. 

I could recount each time I had had any contact with water I felt unexplainable terror. Drinking water? I felt as if it was suffocating me. Washing my hands? I felt like peeling off my skin from how scared I was that it was touching me. I had no bad experiences with water,so I couldn't understand why. Why I felt like a scared rabbit around something completely harmless. At the end of the day I was relieved. Relieved to finally go to sleep as I drifted off to sleep. But it didn't stop there. My dream was filled with me stuck in a dark,murky body of water that had no end. The sky was cloudy and there was no sign of land. I swam for hours in various directions to see nothing at all. 

I woke up covered in a cold sweat. I felt like throwing up,screaming,crying,all of it. But I calmed down and grabbed a cold glass of water. As I took my first sip I gagged. Like it was the grossest thing I'd ever tasted. I took the sip and kept it down despite feeling the urge to throw up. I rolled myself into a blanket burrito and sat down to watch my favorite show. Feeling ill as though I had eaten rotten food. I grabbed my phone and texted my friend about it,and he laughed. That bastard fucking laughed. I felt so angry I didn't answer.

At the end of the day part of me didn't want to sleep. But after fighting my body for a bit I fell asleep. This dream was almost the same,the same endless void of whatever body of water I was in. The same gray sky. I'd almost say there was no difference if I hadn't seen her. There was a woman. She had large curls in her hair and a delicate bow held up half of the curls. She was wearing a velvet dress,in texture and color. She had brunette hair. I yelled for her but nothing came out. Only gurgles as the water filled my mouth and I fell under the water. 

I woke up the same day as before. I ran to the bathroom and threw up in the toilet. I sat on the bathroom floor. Feeling sick and tired. I got up to shower. I gathered my clothes and a towel and hopped in the water. As I stood there staring at the shower walls I slightly glanced down. I hopped out of the shower and ran to grab my phone immediately. My blood ran cold and as the person I had called answered the phone I could exactly recall what I had seen. I had seen the dark murky water as like in my dream,but.

I had also seen curly blonde hair wrapping around my feet.

I had basically begged and cried to my friend as I asked them to stay with me for awhile,to which they agreed. Once they came over they exclaimed quite loudly "Jesus Christ you look dead!" I hadn't noticed but they were right. I look in the mirror and saw my sunken in eyes and dark eyes bags and grayish skin,comparable to that of a corpse. I had to calmly explain to them that I wasn't dying as they persisted I look as if I was on the brink of death. 

The next few days rolled by as if nothing happened the days before. I felt back in shape,the looming fear disappeared,and I became less ill looking. I genuinely thought those were just rough days and brushed everything off. After my friend left I felt confident. Confident I had nothing to worry about at all. 

The next morning I got up,happy I could return to my normal life. I decided to run myself warm bath as some sort of reward for myself for getting over whatever had been haunting me for those few days. As I lay in the tub listening to music I thought of how silly it was for me to worry. Worry about some dream that had a tole on my mental health. It was nothing at all. 

I sit for awhile thinking about how I need to finish the research and Lorelai Hummings when I felt the warm bath run cold. I kept my eyes though. I was slightly dozing off when I felt it. A hand gripping my inner thigh.  I bolted awake and was scared to see the water had turned that same murky black water. Multiple hands began to arise,gripping every part of me. Pulling me down. I tried to pulled myself up,but as if on instinct the hands lurched at my hands gripping the side of the tub. My hand fell into my water but my other hand was thankfully holding on the wall. I pulled myself out of the water. The hand being careful not to scratch me,aggressively latching onto my body with the tips of there fingers.

I stumbled out of the tub and wrapped the towel around myself. I sat on the bathroom floor looking at the tub with the hands gripping around it as if look for me. I think I lost it at that point. I cried and cried until I fell asleep. When I awoke. Someone was standing over me. It was that friend who had stayed with me. He stared at me in shock and and picked me up over his shoulder on threw me on my bed. I was clearly awake at this point. Scared like I had just been a rabbit moments before death. 

"Fucking hell!"

I yelled as the friend stepped away as if to get a better look at me. 

"Where have you been?" He asked

"What?" I responded,dumbfound

"Don't tell me 'what',what have you been doing?"

"I-I'm not sure," I replied still confused.

"What do you mean? You've literally been radio silent for a week!" He yelled walking out of the room,

I was confused. I had only been out for a few hours at best. But I couldn't comprehend how I had possibly slept for a whole week. I felt no different than from when I fell asleep. I wasn't dehydrated or hungry. I was surprised I wasn't dead. I got up and dressed,and walked out to my friend,who was a guy who barely looked upset by anything,crying. He was crying into the palms of his hands.

He then cried as he explained he asked everyone where I was,only for them to reply they hadn't heard from me at all. He cried as he left the house to make a couple phone calls,he said. I was left thinking of it over and over again. It wasn't possible. I knew it wasn't,I'd be dead. 

He came back in and sat down in the couch. 

"So what were you doing?" He asked as calmly as he could muster. My words were lodged in my throat as I thought of how to explain that I was sleeping for a whole week without dying. I couldn't explain it properly. But the words finally came out.

"I-I don't know how but I was sleeping. For.. that.. whole week," I responded. His eyes grew wide,as he started yelling I shouldn't be lying to him and he was genuinely concerned I had disappeared or worst.

He yelled his head off before leaving my house. I walked on around my house stressed. I picked up my phone and saw over a hundred notifications. I started going through them bit by bit. When one caught my eye. It was from Terrance. Terrance had sent me an email less than five words long.

"Good luck with her," 

They paid me then blocked me on everything. I looked at those words for awhile. My mind blank. I then felt multiple emotions at once. Anger,sadness,despair,confusion. What had they meant? Did they know what I was going through? Should I explain it to my friends? These thoughts ran through my head. At the end I felt numb. I was stuck with her. Whatever her was. I got up. Walked to my bed and fell asleep.

I was in the same dream again,except I was closer to the boat. The woman was still facing away from me,I yelled,this time my voice came through clear and she turned to look at me. She was a black woman with wide brown eyes. She stared at me before reaching out her hand toward me,I tried to grip onto her hand but something pulled me down. She grew panicked instantly. She turned around and plunged her hands into the water to get me out. But I had sunk too far into the water for her to grab onto me.

This is where I'd say I woke up,but I didn't. I sunk into the black water,murky water. It was completely empty. It was surprisingly clear for it's color from above. But I couldn't see anything. It fell into complete darkness. I looked around. I could see light filtering through it but it eventually lead to nothing. I fell farther into the water when I saw it. Another woman. I could barely see her facial features but she was there. Staring at me. 

I woke up in an unfamiliar place,but by the light in the sky I could guess in the woods. I sat straight up,and turned my head. My house was right there. Lights on and everything. I got up and walked over to it. I had multiple scratches and dirt covering me. I couldn't understand how. If I were to pass out,possibly,POSSIBLY,sleep walk outside and lay on the ground. I would really only expect dirt,but no. I was covered in scratches as well. 

As I sat on my couch,feeling absolutely insane. Should I call another friend to come and stay with me? I didn't have time to think further. The lights went out. I jumped,and calmed myself down. Telling myself I had a large flashlight in the closet. I thought I'd like to check the electrical box if something was going on down there. I got the flashlight and started my journey to the basement.

The stairs were creaky,and it was dark. I was jumping left and right at noises. I was a sheep scared of my own shadow. I looked around with the flashlight. I finally found it. I tinkered with it for a bit before I saw a light from the stairs turn back on. I was happy with my work,and started walking toward the stairs. 

The door of the basement shut with a sudden snap. Like the force closing the door almost broke it.  I jumped and started walking backward until I hit the wall holding the electrical box. I froze. Letting my flashlight shine through the basement expectingly. As I watched holding my breath,a pipe burst made me yelp. I almost dropped my flashlight. Another burst,and another. About five pipes had burst. Water was sprinkling into the basement. I stood still has a statue,as the cold water soaked my feet. I was breathing heavily and looking around scared.

Once the entire basement floor was covered in water. It showed itself. A head of blond water drifted on the other side of the room. It stayed there for a moment. Not moving. It then started getting closer. But as it did. It grew. The hair showed a forehead,which showed a pair of eyes,which turned into a face,and so on. Once the thing was fully out of water I could almost tell exactly what it was.

It was the woman from my dream,the woman I couldn't tell the exact features of at the bottom of the body of water I was in. Her eyes were covered in something,it was thick and oily. Her blonde hair was stained with green water and she was wearing a teal dress similar to the other girl in my dreams. She stood infront of me,barely a foot away. It became apparent she was a singing a song. She was singing some sort of Scottish lullaby. I felt more heavy. I felt tired almost. And I fell forward into her arms. I sank with her as she descended into the water,and my body began to be surrounded by cold,freezing,dirty water.

When I awoke,I was in the ocean. I was floating and staring into the lit night sky,and I felt content,and drifted back to sleep.

Edit:If anyone has advice as to how to make my stories longer without seeming rushed as well,please tell me it.

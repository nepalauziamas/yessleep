I'm not in a safe space as I write this, and I desperately need someone's help.  


Before I get too ahead of myself, allow me to explain just how I got in this predicament.  


It started out innocently enough, and to protect his identity, I'm going to say for the sake of this story that his name is Duke. I had no idea who Duke was until he appeared on a celebrity competition show. Again, in an attempt to protect his identity, I will not tell you what this competition show was, but let's just say celebrities are paired with professionals and compete to be the last couple remaining.  


I saw Duke, innocently thought "he's cute", and left it at that. I continued to watch this show with my family, and each week my fascination with Duke grew and grew. I eventually decided to google him and found out his background: he was a TV soap opera star, born and raised in \[REDACTED\], currently dating someone named... let's call her Maria.  


In an effort to see more of Duke, I began to watch the TV show he was on. He played a bad boy character, and I was *hooked*. He was so hot exerting his character's masculine dominance on others, just to show his soft side when he was with his character's wife and child. And god, I never noticed how incredibly chiseled he was, with cheese grater abs and pecs you could get a good grab of.  


Watching him on these two shows was not enough, so I began going through Duke's entire filmography and watching everything he has ever starred in. *God damn*, he's so *fucking* hot. Ughhhhh. I need this man, even if it's just for a one night stand.  


My googling became more investigative, and with the power of the internet, I discovered what suburb he lived in, which was only about an hour away from me. But I wasn't going to just drive around this suburb looking for him, no. I'm a classy lady, and am aware that I am conventionally attractive to most men that doesn't need to resort to crazy tactics like this.  


His relationship with Maria seemed to be growing, and they were spotted out by paparazzi on cute dates, unable to keep their hands off each other. Look, I had no issue with Maria, but I was just so... so... *jealous*. It was as if I was a child again watching my sister play with my toy. That was my property. *Duke* was my property.  


As I walked past the TV in my lounge room, an episode of *Charmed* was playing. And this is where I formulated this stupid idea, which at the time, I thought was a great idea.  


I had an idea of Wicca and how they would use magic, and so I conducted a quick google search on how to cast a love spell. As I began scrolling through the mechanics of magic, I learned about the Rule of Three: it states that whatever energy a person puts out into the world, be it positive or negative, will be returned to that person three times.  


With a shrug of my shoulders, I exited out of the tab, and before you knew it, I was lighting a pink candle with a match, holding a picture of Duke in my hand, and was reciting the love spell that I came up with in my head.  


*I call upon the powers divine,*  
*To bring to me which is mine.*  
*Our fates will be sealed forever,*  
*And we will part, never.*  
*You will love me.*  
*You will love me.*  


I chanted the spell out loud, and with thoughts of my happy life with Duke in my mind, I burned the photo of him. As the last piece of paper faded away in flames, I blew the spell out and went to sleep, excited to see what would happen.  


Waking up in the morning, while I wasn't expecting to wake up next to him with an engagement ring, I expected to at least feel different. But I didn't feel any different at all. So I took to social media to see what he was up to. I didn't get a magical new follow or DM from him; he wasn't visiting my suburb for a guest appearance any time soon. Nothing.  


I sat on it for a couple of extra days, checking to see where Duke was and what he was up to every minute in every hour, but still, nothing.  


Until I saw that he announced his engagement with Maria.  


To say that I was absolutely livid would be an understatement. I couldn't understand how this man who should've loved me as much as I loved him could go out and betray me like this. Did he not think of our future son and daughter when he made this stupid mistake? And what about our Cancun wedding? Why was Maria all of a sudden getting it?  


It felt like I had been hit by a train, and moments later I had to run to the bathroom to vomit. But I was adamant that I was going to show Duke just how much he really loved me. So I did what any normal woman would do; I made dozens of troll accounts on social media and told Maria that she should \[REDACTED\] and disappear off to \[REDACTED\] forever.  


This bitch... this *fucking little bitch* was not going to get my life. Over my *fucking* dead body, Maria.  


I'm not going to disclose just how I found his exact address, but let's just say that it wasn't entirely legal. I sent letters addressed to Maria, telling her that she was ruining a happy family and that karma would come around and hit her like a mac truck. I used my social media accounts to tell her how she had ruined lives with her selfishness, but she continued to block every single one of them. And yet, she'd continue to smile on her social media, and would parade around with Duke as if he belonged to her.  


If she was going to ignore my letters and my threatening social media posts, then I would tell her in person.  


I got into my car, blinked, and then suddenly I was standing outside of Duke's house. I do not remember the drive over here at all. It was like I was in a trance. I blinked again, and I appeared in his attic, listening to Duke having a happy conversation with *that fucking little bitch* just below me.  


I looked around his... sorry, *our* dusty attic and found an old mirror sitting in the corner. I blinked, and suddenly I had a shard of glass in my hand, and the mirror was broken.  


The broken shard of glass was almost cutting into my hands, but I didn't care. Until I saw my reflection in this shard, and saw my bleeding forehead and the deranged look on my face. It was so far gone from the reflection I was used to, I was almost sure that there was a crazy woman behind me, but as I blinked, so did the reflection, and as I tilted my head, so did she.  


I gasped, and dropped the shard of glass. Who was this monster? What had I become?  


Now that you've been caught up, you will understand what I mean when I said I'm not in a safe place.   


I'm currently sitting in Duke's attic, blood dripping down my face, scrolling through my phone, asking Reddit for help. Because I'm pretty sure I heard Duke call the police and report noises in his house, and Maria screaming that her stalker was here to get her.  


If I don't get out of here unscathed, then neither is Duke. Because I am not living without him, and he is not living without me. And that is all on you.

I went on a vacation in Transylvania with my wife, renting a cheap old wooden cabin near a forest. It was a really lovely place, the view was great, and we had a great time until something ruined everything. I always knew Transylvania as the home of the vampires. Now I know it as the home of something much worse. 

On our first day, a guy called Sandor introduced the place to us. He showed us the cabin. It was small, only had a living room and a bedroom, but it was enough for just a week. He also talked about the history of the place, which was near a small city called Balan, if I remember correctly. It was a mining town during the soviet occupation, but all the mines were closed decades ago. 

Sandor told us to visit the city if we have the time or run out of food because it’s a nice place and only a few kilometers away. We paid him the price for our stay, then he walked away. 

So, the first day was great. There was even a river nearby. When I walked around the cabin to explore the place, I noticed some footprints near the back of the building. A lot of footprints, actually.  

“Hey, do you see that?” I asked my wife. 

“The footprints? Yeah, I see it,” she responded.

“Isn’t it strange? Like there is a lot, and I’m not sure if it’s human or some kind of animal.”

“It’s summer, of course it’s full of footprints. There were a bunch of tourists here before us.”

The rest of the day quickly went by, and I wasn’t bothered by the footprints anymore. We went to sleep a few hours later. I woke up at about 3 in the morning when I heard my wife speaking. 

“The footprints?” she asked. “It’s summer, full of footprints.”

I turned my head towards her. I could see her worried face in the night, but I didn’t quite understand what she wanted to say. 

“Huh?” I responded. 

“It wasn’t me,” she whispered with a worried voice. 

I was even more confused, thinking about what the hell she was talking about. I’m too sleepy for this, I thought. 

“What… what wasn’t you?”

“I didn’t say anything. I heard the voice too, but it wasn’t me! There is someone else here.”

She sounded panicked. As I processed her words, I became worried too. I was thinking about Sandor, maybe he just came back because he forgot something there, but then I remembered that it was a female voice, which sounded exactly like my wife. 

“We need to do something, I’m scared,” she whispered.

“I didn’t say anything,” I heard her voice again, but she wasn’t speaking, and looked just as scared as me. 

“The sound came from under the bed,” I said and started shivering. I watched too many horror movies about monsters and killers hiding under the bed and hoped it was just some bad nightmare. 

“There is someone under the bed?” she asked. I had to look at her every time she spoke to know if it was really her talking. 

I looked at the desk beside the bed, trying to find something to protect ourselves from whatever was hiding under our bed. There wasn’t anything useful there except my car keys, so I grabbed them along with my phone, which I used to illuminate the room.

I looked under the bed, prepared to see something horrifying down there, but there wasn’t anything. 

“There isn’t anything here,” I looked up to my wife. 

“Are you sure?” she asked. “I’m sure the voice came from there.”

“There is someone under the bed?” I heard her voice coming from under the bed again. 

“What the hell is going on?” I said. 

“Please, just call the police and leave this place,” my wife said. 

“Help me move the bad,” I said. “Just drag it a few meters away, so we can see if there’s really something under it.” 

We moved our bed, and what we found under it was surprising and scary at the same time. It was a large hole, leading into a cave underground. I illuminated it with my phone. It was deep, full of spiderwebs. I think I saw rails about ten meters deep. 

“Why is there a cave here?” my wife asked. 

“It looks like it leads to a mine,” I responded.

“Why would someone build a cabin like this on top of a hole?”

“Well, I don’t know, maybe it was an entrance the miners used, I have no idea.”

“And now what?” she asked. “What about the voice we’ve heard? It sounded just like me!”

“Maybe I should go down to check if there is someone there. Maybe somebody is trapped down there and needs help.”

“Are you crazy? Don’t go inside, we don’t know what’s there!” 

“Why is there a cave here?” We heard the voice again from the cave. I was frightened at that point. It was a bad idea to go there.

“Look, I’ll just check the mine, a minute and I’ll be back,” I said. The cave wasn’t that steep, so I could just crawl back out of it if I had to. I jumped down before my wife could’ve argued with me. 

I went down and looked around. It was really a mine, with rails and an old mine cart in front of me. Then I looked behind my back and froze. 

It was a creature about 4 meters behind me. I would say it looked humanoid, but it had multiple legs, like… around 5 or 6 very thin legs and two arms. It was about as tall as me, with dark green skin. Its head looked human, but I don’t remember seeing eyes on it. It spoke.

“Are you crazy?” 

It sounded just like my wife, but I could see the creature saying it.

“I’m happy I’ll retire next week. These things keep killing our workers,” the creature said in a voice that I couldn’t recognize. 

They could speak. Then I saw another one walking behind him as a six-legged creature could walk. Then another one. I crawled back out of the cave. It felt like forever until I reached the exit, crawling to my room. 

“Did you see anything?” my wife asked as soon as I jumped out of the hole. 

“Get out, get out!” I waved towards the exit, then grabbed her arm and we ran out of the cabin.

“What happened?”

“There are things in the cave! Get in the car, we’re spending the night in the city, I’ll call the police!”

We left the country the next day. The police didn’t believe me, and I don’t think they even investigated the cabin. I only realize now that they couldn’t speak. They just kept repeating things others said. Maybe the unknown voice the creature mimicked was a miner who worked there decades ago. 

There are creatures living in the caves, underground. The mines were closed for a reason, it seems. I think it’ll remain a secret for a while, as I haven’t found more information about those mines. I guess only time will tell.

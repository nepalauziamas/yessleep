Hi everyone, Let me introduce myself I work as an Officer in the Police of the Netherlands.

I want to keep my name anonymous.

Actually, I'm not supposed to Release This Information, but I'm Resigning Soon, After What I've Been Going Through Here...

&#x200B;

It was a late night, I was on duty with my Colleague Agent Willems

We'd had a lot of Regular Reports Today, A Drunk Driver, a Confused Partygoer, and so on...

&#x200B;

Until we heard on the radio "22-01, 22-07 & 22-91, Asap go to the Lange Veldweg 110, Priority 1"

My Colleague turned on the Siren and We Broke On the spot, We asked the Control Room what was going on there but they remained vague.

Once On-Site On The Remote Field Road There Was Nothing, No Houses, No Cars, Nothing, We Stood On A Dirt Path In The Dark, The Only Light Was The Car's Headlights And The Blue Siren Lights Reflecting Off The Trees.

&#x200B;

I and my colleague looked at each other with such a Look of 'I think we are in the wrong place'.

We were about to ask the Control Room if we were in the right place and where the other Colleagues Were, We got back from the Control Room that the Colleagues Were already on-site, With us.

&#x200B;

However, there was not even a single Life to be seen Except Me and My Colleague.

We were about to drive back but when i heard the car start we suddenly a scream from the woods we decided to go into the woods and have a look, we walked a round through the woods it might take a while Half an hour but it felt like we were walking for hours, at one point we Decided To go back to our car, It must have been the wind we said.

&#x200B;

Once we got back to the place where we left the car there was nothing, all there was was some scary candles, there were no tire tracks in the dirt road, we thought this was one bad joke from our colleagues.

&#x200B;

Suddenly my colleague said, "What do you mean" and looked at Me.

I said I didn't say anything and there was silence, My colleague said I asked him something, he couldn't understand what.

&#x200B;

Suddenly there was a noise, I was shocked, Fortunately, it was only our walkie-talkie making noise, The Control Room Operator Asked if we needed assistance.

I said "Yes, Our car has disappeared without a trace", There was silence on the other end of the line.

The operator told that this also happened to the other 2 Teams.

&#x200B;

We were shocked and asked for immediate assistance, the colleague from the control room said they could no longer contact the other colleagues.

Suddenly we hear a scream from the forest and we see Light Shine, We pack our flashlights and shone into the woods, My Colleague Called "Hello, Police Make You Known"

We looked at each other and Walked into the Woods.

&#x200B;

With our hands on the Firearms we walked into the woods, My colleague led the way, Suddenly he stopped and he turned pale.

He pulls out his firearm and yells "Police, Hands Up"

I say "What are you doing", there was nothing to see but The light reflecting off the trees.

Suddenly we hear a scream coming from out of nowhere, A Huge White monster came up to us, It had torn clothes and had red bloodshot eyes, and also had Arms below its Knees.

We open fire, We saw that it has no effect, So we started running, Meanwhile, we asked the switchboard where the Colleagues were staying. The switchboard asked what happened because the Thing Crawled Screaming After us, At that moment I threw a Flashbang, That's a kind of Grenade, but then it comes out with a Big Flash and a Loud Bang.

&#x200B;

the Monster ran and we kept running, it seemed like hours, We hadn't gone that deep into the woods, after all, I had a mental breakdown, we were lost in a dark forest, No Range on the Phone, a Big Monster what had come after us and an empty gun magazine.

&#x200B;

We searched for hours, and finally, we could find the way out through the siren of the arriving colleagues.

We noticed that the Cars were not Normal Police Cars, but Black BMWs Audis, and other Fast Cars.

The officers also looked different, they had on a Full Gray Uniform, Thick Bulletproof Vests, a Large Automatic Rifle and they had Grenades on their vests.

They told us not to tell anyone about this, Later when we were recovering we heard screaming and gunshots coming out of the woods again, To our great surprise we saw our car in the bushes, I was sure we were there and soon looked, then there was nothing.

Finally, the Weird men with heavy vests came back from the woods, They brought a stretcher with a white sheet over it, they didn't bring this stretcher with something on it to an ambulance, but she put it in the back of a van that had come, later I fell On that they had a logo on their shoulder, After some research, I found out that this is the logo of the so-called "SCP Foundation".

It’s hard to count running footsteps in the dark. How many of them were there? Ten? A hundred? I couldn’t say. But just before Cayden slammed the cabin storm shutters in their faces, I got a look at the Silent Kids.

Whatever was controlling them, it was putting them through hell.

Their skin was cut by thorns and their clothes were splattered with mud…they must’ve  come over thirty miles to Hugh’s cabin *on foot.*

I wondered if they felt the pain. I wonder if they were still conscious somewhere in there, screaming in the dark on the other side of those dead, doll-like faces.

I didn’t have to wonder, however, what had happened to Hugh.

In the eerie red glow of the silent kids’ phones, I could see that some of their fists and feet were bloody…*like they’d just beaten someone to death.*

Cayden slammed the stutters on the Silent kids a few seconds before they shattered the glass.

*“Oh shit oh shit oh shit…”* Sammy was hunched over on the floor, clutching her skull. Outside, the Silent Kids were pounding on the walls of the cabin. I couldn’t tell if they were trying to tear the building apart with their bare hands or just drive us insane from the noise.

The walls and roof were sturdy; Hugh had made sure of that.

It was the storm shutters that I was worried about. They seemed to come a little looser with every bash from outside. While Cayden tried to match guns to ammo, I considered the possibilities. I’d never seen any of the Silent Kids drive–or do anything else more complicated than stalking people on foot–so how far would they go to get us out of here? *All they’d have to do was light a fire…*

Behind me, Cayden released the safety of an AR-15. I swatted the barrel down toward the floor.

“Don’t shoot any of ‘em!” I pleaded. “Not unless there’s no other way.”

“Here!” Sammy whispered. I’d thought she’d just been having a mental breakdown on the floor, but she’d been looking for something: *a cellar door.* Of course. If anyone would have a trapdoor in his cabin, it was Hugh. “My uncle showed me this tunnel when I was a little girl. I used to play down there, until I grew up and got grossed out by bugs and dirt…” Cayden was already scrambling forward, rifle and flashlight in hand. Monster barked and followed after. Another nasty blow splintered the storm shutters–

And as I stood to follow Cayden, my leg gave out. A pulled muscle? Sprained ankle? I had no idea, but it looked like I was going nowhere. The lightbulb swung wildly from the battering hands and feet  hitting the cabin walls.

“Get a move on,” I told Sam. “Looks like this is as far as I go.” I lay back and clutched my thigh.

*“No way.”* I couldn’t believe it. Sammy had grabbed me by the shoulders. She dragged me to the tunnel– “you’re getting out of here even if you have to drag yourself and I have to push you from behind! Now *get crawling!”* No one had spoken to me like that since my wife Pam died, but it got me moving.

The tunnel was damp and filthy. It was barely wide enough for a person Sammy or Cayden’s size, and I wasn’t as skinny as I used to be. Every foot was agony, but we were getting somewhere…I only hoped that wherever we got, it would be far enough away.

“Oh *shit.*” Cayden gasped up ahead. It wasn’t exactly a phrase you wanted to hear when crammed into a dark, muddy tunnel. There was a funny smell in the air, like cow pies mixed with gasoline. “ANFO…” He’d crawled out into a small dirt room. In the glow of his flashlight, I could see plastic sacks filled with crumbly white stuff, like styrofoam. A gas mask, hazmat suit, and other survival gear hung from the wall.

“What is all this stuff?” Sammy asked as she helped me squeeze out of the tunnel.

“It’s an explosive.” Cayden explained. “One of the easiest ones to make at home. It doesn’t detonate on its own, but there’s probably a blasting charge around here somewhere. Maybe Tovex or Pentolite.” We stared. “*What?!*” Cayden rolled his eyes. “I wrote my History term paper on the Oklahoma City Bomber. This is the stuff *he* used.”

“Hugh really was preparing for the end of the world…” Sammy said in awe. “Are you thinking what I’m thinking?”

“The cave?” Cayden asked. Sammy nodded.

“Are you two out of your minds?!” I hissed. “We gotta get as far away from this town as possible and let the authorities handle this!”

“Like how they’ve been handling it so far?” Cayden snapped back. I groaned and shut my eyes. We weren’t explosive experts. We weren’t soldiers or government agents. We didn’t stand a chance against whatever was out there…

“We don’t have much time before the Silent kids figure out the trapdoor…and we haven’t gone nearly far enough.” I sighed. “Check to see what’s outside before you go all Rambo on me.”

“What’s a ‘*Rambo’*?” Cayden whispered as he peered out the door of our makeshift space. We were in some kind of shed that had been disguised to blend into the woods. On the dirt track between the cabin and ourselves, I could see Hugh’s pickup truck and the sedan that Sammy had driven up here. I heard her take out her keys and shush Monster, who’d come panting up the tunnel behind us. “Looks like the coast is clear. Hang on a sec.”

Sammy took my weight onto her shoulder. We moved toward the sedan as quietly as we could under the circumstances. Without our flashlights, all we could distinguish up ahead were twisted black shapes.

The woods were oddly quiet: no rustling of small animals or hum of insects.

There was no movement from the cabin, either.

We were about halfway up the dirt track to where the cars were parked when a red square lit up in the trees about fifty feet away. *One of the silent kids’ phones.* All throughout the forest, other screens lit up in response. *They’d spread out methodically to track us.*

In the eerie red light, the silent kids’ eyes seemed to glow as well. For the first time I realized that there was a sort of hum coming from their devices. Sammy clutched her head in pain.

*“Go go go!”* Cayden hissed behind us. We needed speed more than silence. Sammy unlocked her sedan with a remote key, practically flung me into the back, and slipped into the driver’s seat. Cayden came up behind with the rifle…and several sacks of the stuff from Hugh’s shed. In the headlights, we could see them charging the car. Monster jumped into the backseat beside Hugh’s gear, barking his head off.

As Sammy started the car and swerved through the crowd of Silent Kids, Cayden reached for Hugh’s AR-15–

I threw it out the window.

“What the *fuck?!”* Cayden roared.

“This isn’t some damn video game!” I yelled back. “Those are *real kids* out there, and they might be alright if we could just get’em free of…of whatever this is.”

“Oh yeah?!” Cayden snarled. “And what if we *can’t?!* What if this has spread to every town in the country by now? Or the world?!” There were tears in Cayden’s eyes. “My own little *brother* is one of them!”

Silence. We bumped down the dirt road, chased by the running shadows in Sammy’s tail lights. Cayden was still furious about the rifle, but I’d proved my own theory by throwing it away: none of the Silent Kids had tried to shoot us with it, or even acknowledged it. Whatever was controlling them could stalk and set traps on a massive scale, but it didn’t *really* understand how our world worked.

I was too tired and in too much pain to pay much attention to my surroundings. I didn’t even realize I was back in my own neighborhood until Sammy parked at the end of a subdivision that I recognized. It was a cul-de-sac with only four houses butting up against the woods, and although I’d walked past the winding path at its end on many an afternoon, I’d never known where it led–

Until now.

The hill beneath the power lines. The cave. Cayden and Sammy were actually going to go through with their crazy plan. Their boneheaded idea wasn’t the only thing making me nervous, however…

Since we’d gotten back to town, we hadn’t seen a single one of the Silent Kids.

For almost a week now, I’d seen them on street corners and walking in packs at all hours of the day or night. Where had they all gone?

In fact, we hadn’t seen *anyone.* It was barely six A.M., but even so, we should’ve encountered a passing car, a jogger…

But the neighborhood was as quiet as the forest had been. I rolled my window down and took a deep breath. The air was damp and chilly. Light was only just beginning to creep into the sky. Something had *changed* since we’d gone up to the cabin. I could *feel it.*

A slamming car door snapped me out of my reverie. Cayden was standing beside the trunk, reading the instructions on the blasting cap.

“Stay here, boy,” Sammy stuck her head in the window and petted Monster, who was whining. I couldn’t tell if she was talking to me or the dog, but all it took was one look at my leg to know for sure that I wouldn’t be going down any more forest trails. I moved it and winced.

“I’m begging you,” I grunted, “do *not* do this! You’re going to get yourselves killed.”

“Don’t worry,” Sammy tried to smile. “We’ll be *fine!*” I could see the fear in her eyes. She wasn’t any more confident in this harebrained scheme than I was. She loaded the plastic bags of explosive into a sporty turquoise backpack she kept in her trunk.

“Go on ahead” Cayden muttered to her. He was still trying to understand the fine print on the blasting cap. “I’ll catch up.” Once Sammy was out of earshot, Cayden leaned in the window and spoke to me. “Mr. Hal–er, Rich…I’ve been thinking about something Sam said earlier. About how she saw the red light on phones while she was being led through the woods…”

“You don’t think…?”

“No. She doesn’t act *anything* like them. I think…” Cayden took a deep breath “...I think it only affects *kids* somehow. Young people. Ms. Black in music class told us one time that there are frequencies that only people under 24 can hear, and maybe…maybe it's like that.”

“Lemme get this straight: you’re saying that whatever is controlling the Silent Kids only affects folks under twenty or so, because you all are the only ones who can perceive it?” I summed up. Cayden nodded.

“That’s why I need you do me another favor, Rich.” Cayden looked at the gravy, misty world around us with a thousand-yard-stare that I’d only ever seen in my black-and-white war movies. “If I come back down that trail…and I’m not…*me…*” Cayden pointed a finger-gun at the side of his head and made a firing motion. “I don’t wanna kill anybody, Rich. I don’t wanna have to watch from inside my own body while my hands tear somebody apart, like they did to Hugh…*God, please, Rich–don’t let me become one of them!”*

Cayden leaned on the car, bawling his eyes out. I opened the door, leaned on my cane, and forced myself to my feet despite the pain. I hugged the kid tight.

“I won’t let you kill anyone.” I promised.

In my head, however, I was silently praying that I wouldn’t have to make that choice. We’d only known each other for a single night, but Cayden already felt like the grandchild I’d never had. I couldn’t see myself pointing my .38 at his face and pulling the trigger.

When the tears dried up, Cayden straightened his back, squeezed my shoulder, and set off into the gray woods in pursuit of Sammy.

It was only after he’d left and the fog began to clear that I noticed the hooded body laying face-down in a nearby yard. In their gray sweatshirt and green cargo pants, they’d blended in perfectly with the misty morning grass.

A phone lay beside its outstretched hand, and as I approached, it lit up with an eerie red glow.

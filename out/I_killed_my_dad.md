   On my way from school it rained. ‘What a gloomy day to die on’ I thought to myself and that was when something crossed my mind. I got off of the bus few stops away from my house and ran into the shop. When I handed the rat poison to the cashier she looked at me suspiciously. “ you aren’t going to take them yourself right?” she laughed. ‘Disgusting’ I thought to myself. I know I’m a very gloomy looking person but who asks that to a random person they met for the first time. “They are for my dad” I answered with all seriousness and the smile on her face faded away. “oh, did he ask  you to buy them for him?” she asked so awkwardly that it made me cringe. I handed her the money and left without answering. 

When I got home no one was there. My mom was going to be at work till very late, one of my brothers was at his soccer practice and the other one was at his after school study. Only person who would be coming home early was my dad. As soon as he got home he asked me to reheat the soup while he took a shower. I put shit ton amount of rat poison in his bowl and set it on the table. My heart was beating fast from excitement, I was trying my best to hide my smile, finally I would be free. After few sips he started choking and white foam started to flow out of his mouth, seeing him so vulnerable and sick made me happy. He died. Since I live in an apartment building it was too dangerous to take his body outside in the broad daylight so I just threw it in the basement. He’s the only one that goes down there so it was the safest place to hide his corpse. 

Evening came and everyone was home. Nobody asked anything about his whereabouts since it was normal for him to stay out or come back very late at night after drinking with his friends. We ate dinner and went to bed like usual. 

In the morning I heard a familiar male voice yell for me and my brothers to wake up. Imagine the shock I felt when I saw my father standing in the doorway of the bedroom. I was sure I had killed him, it wasn’t a dream, it couldn’t have been…

\*\*\*

Mom had yet another business trip and as always she took my brothers with her and left me alone with this creature that I have to call my dad. This was another chance for me to get rid of him, at this point I really didn’t care about going to jail for life if it meant that he would be dead. My plan was to slit his throat in his sleep. Luckily for me he’s a heavy sleeper, nothing can wake him up. 

He fell asleep around 1 am while watching the TV. I waited few minutes to make sure he was deep asleep. I grabbed the sharpest knife we had and covered every inch of my body with clothes I didn’t like, of course I wouldn’t want to get his filthy and disgusting blood on my skin, its awful enough that his blood flows in my veins… every time I get reminded of that I just want to claw out my blood vessels. 

I stood in the dark hallway with a knife in my hand staring inside the room, huge TV screen slightly lit the room. This scene was familiar, it wasn’t the first time I’ve done this, contemplating whether to kill my family or not. Unlike all those times I was actually going to finish the job tonight. Even though I’ve watched multiple videos on dark web with this type of scenes I still was little bit confused about how to start slitting his throat. After few minutes of trying to figure out how to do it I finally pushed knife at his throat and slid it across as fast and with as much force as I possibly could. The blood started splashing out of his throat as he opened his eyes choking on his blood with a confused expression on his face. But obviously I wasn’t satisfied, he mentally and physically tortured me for 19 years and just a small slit on his throat wouldn’t make up for it.  I kept stabbing him in the chest, stomach and his face. I could feel adrenaline flow in my body, I haven’t felt this much excitement and happiness in years. 

He was unrecognizable, his face had turned into a mush of meat and I was finally satisfied. I didn’t bother cleaning up since nobody would be coming home for a week, I turned off the TV and went to sleep. 

In the morning the smell of food woke me up. ‘what are the neighbours cooking for a smell to be so strong that I can feel it in my house’ I thought to myself while getting out of the bed. I started heading to the kitchen but froze in the doorway, I could feel my heart drop when I realized that the smell was coming from MY kitchen. I slowly and quietly walked to the kitchen and once again was hit with a wave of shock. He was standing at the stove cooking some type of soup. I immediately turned my head towards the living room where I had turned his body into a mush last night, it was clean… as if nothing had happened. My knees started to weaken from fear, I was about to collapse when he turned towards me “if you are awake start cleaning the house” he said in that disgusting and irritable voice of his.

In a few minutes, this document will be the only *real* account left of the events that have plagued my community for the last two weeks. I stand in the center of these beat-up old stairs, gazing out an oddly placed window at a moon that resembles a ghoul, an omnipotent monster staring down at me in judgment. If I needed a sign, I’d say that’s it. I don’t need a sign, though; I’ve arrived at my current destination by pure fate. Tonight will most likely be the last I spend on Earth.

For the record, I don’t believe in fate, and I sure as hell don’t believe in suicide. That said, once you hear my story, I’m pretty sure you’ll agree there’s no other way to interpret or end this living hell in which I find myself trapped. So where does that leave me and my beliefs?

Fucked, that’s where.

Before I pull the ripcord, though, I have to set the record straight. Over the past fourteen days, I think that I've killed almost a dozen people. I’m the guy the L.A. papers dubbed “The Silverlake Slasher.” I never wanted to hurt anyone - certainly not a bunch of random people I’d never met. I didn’t have a choice, though. We all end up doing what we have to, sometimes very much in spite of what we want. Believe it or not, that can be true of killers, too. And after a while, well, this meat suit we walk around in can develop appetites, even for shit that repulses us. That’s what happened to me, albeit in a pretty roundabout way.

So why don’t I just shut the fuck up and open my veins, spare everyone the sob story, right? Well, way I figure it, I have to try and warn people because once I’m gone, I’m pretty sure The Process will just find someone else to fill my shoes. If I can save another human being from falling into the same horrible shit I did, maybe it’ll be at least one small way to try and make amends. Such a small action could never make up for the horrors I’ve committed, but the simple truth is, appetite or not, I wouldn’t wish this shit on anyone.

\*\*

My name is Reno Blade, Renn to my friends. No, that’s not the name my parents gave me, but it’s how I’ve identified myself since the eleventh grade, so fuck off. I have to have a weird, edgy name: I’m an artist in L.A. - a painter by trade. I work mainly with acrylics, sometimes mixed media. A couple years ago I met a writer/director named Justin Portlock and my life changed. Justin liked my work so much he contacted me with a proposal to commission my stuff for his movie.

I was, in a word, ecstatic.

Justin’s movie *Primordial Return* was grimy, B-Horror fair and I loved it. The story revolved around a painter in the L.A. scene who takes a strange drug and undergoes an eerie metamorphosis: he has almost immediate success with his art but, from there, begins to experience visions that slowly drive him mad and send him on a killing spree. Portlock commissioned me to do a series of paintings that would show the artist’s slow decline into what the audience would be left wondering was either insanity or something far more nefarious.

The film took off, and so did my career. *Shock* Gallery in Silverlake took an interest in my work as a result, and through an exclusive relationship with their space, my paintings began to sell. This was before I caught on to the power of social media as a conduit for sales. Now, Instagram and Big Cartel can keep artists flush, but for a Luddite like me, it was all *Shock* and its owner, Carissa. That relationship would eventually become... unhealthy, but I’m getting ahead of myself.

Several months after *Primordial Return* was released, Justin contacted me about working on a sequel. Of course I was interested, but when I learned that he wanted to make the film about *me*, emergency lights started going off. I met with him for his pitch, but in the end, the entire scenario had an eerie quality that felt a little too real, potentially *dangerous* even. I was supposed to play myself, hired by Justin to work on paintings for a sequel to the first film, only this time, I would find a mysterious package left at my door. Inside? You guessed it - a substance that turned out to be the drug from the first film. The kicker? Portlock revealed there was indeed a real drug his fictional one was based on, and I would be required to actually *take it* as I worked on the pieces for the film, tentatively titled “*Its Soil Be Murder.*”

“What you’re describing sounds like a documentary, Justin.”

“Not exactly. Have I whet your appetite, Renn?” he asked, setting a small glass vial on the table between us.

Curious, I continued to play it cool. Inside the vial, a viscous, purple substance swam in slow motion. It looked like the paraffin wax in a lava lamp.

“What the hell is this stuff?”

“Deschidere.”

“Come again?”

“That’s what they call it in the country where it’s made. It means *Doorway*.”

“The drug in the movie didn’t look anything like this. How would I even ingest this?”

Portlock smiled, confident he had piqued my interest.

“For the movie, I had to take some liberties. There are… proprietary issues.”

“What does that even mean?”

“Only one way to find out, Renn.”

I should talk a little about Justin Portlock here. During the first film, I only met with him in person twice. All other communications, including the one where he introduced himself to me as a fan of my work, were through the internet. As I signed on and began to interact with his small production team, I found that no one talked about him, to a point I’d call obtuse, as though there was an air of unpleasantness that followed his name. When I asked questions about Justin’s background or previous work, a series of impossible-to-find short films listed on his website as “The Guillotine Cycle,” everyone ignored me. The only person who talked about him at all was an Executive Producer on the film who called me early on to tell me how excited he was that I had agreed to lend my paintings to the project.

“When I saw your work, I decided to invest another fifty thousand dollars in the film. Justin has always had a grand vision, but until he found you, I never believed he possessed the ability to realize our vision.”

“*Our vision*?” I wondered but didn’t ask. None of my business, I figured. My first mistake.

This Producer, Benjamin, was a rich man from Syria. His accent was so thick it made his voice sound like someone shaving leather on the other end of the line. Something about the cadence of his voice, and the way he hesitated while speaking - as if choosing his words with extreme precision - gave me an uneasy feeling.

“You must believe in Justin. You must help him realize this project. For the world. For Art.”

Yeah. For art.

I agreed but didn’t hear from Benjamin again until after *Primordial’s* premiere nearly a year later. A Tuesday night showing on opening day of that year’s Beyondfest, it proved a thrill to see my work on the big screen at Hollywood’s historic Egyptian Theatre. Benjamin accosted me in the lobby afterward, surrounded by what I can only describe as a squadron of yes men and secret service-looking motherfuckers. It made me wonder just who this guy was in the “real” world. He shook my hand, squeezed my shoulder and actually patted my ass not once but twice. Later, one of his henchmen found me in the bathroom and handed me a posh velvet bag embroidered with a strange, cross-like design. Inside I found a bottle of purple, Syrian Brandy, a watch engraved with the same symbol, and a large, ornate key that’s bow shared the shape of the symbol on the bag.

It was at that premiere that I met Carissa from *Shock*. She introduced herself to me while I stood around waiting to talk with Justin. I never ended up getting more than a quick pat on the back and an urgent, whispered, “We’ll talk,” from him while he made the rounds playing smiley glad-hands.

“Don’t take it personally, that’s just Portlock.”

Carissa was covered in ink, stood about six-foot-three, and had straight, dark brown hair that hung to her ass. Dressed in an old Mercyful Fate T-shirt, black jeans and motorcycle boots, she proved a breath of fresh air in an otherwise anxiety-ridden social environment. We ended up ducking into the Pig N’ Whistle across the courtyard from the theatre and getting good and loaded before relocating to the afterparty, which was at someone’s hotel, I think. Long story short, I spent the next three nights with Carissa, and by the following weekend, had one of my paintings in her gallery. *Venom Face* was one of my earliest pieces, and not really representational of my current work at that time, but it sold in two hours and garnered four digits. I suppose it was the combination of that sale, the escalating success of the movie, and our deepening lust for one another that propelled Carissa’s decision to block out the following two weeks for an exclusive showing of my work.

Those two weeks laid the foundation for both of us to quit our day jobs. For the first time, I was able to devote one hundred percent of my time to my art. This was without a doubt the most productive period of my career, and looking back on it now I wish I had realized it wouldn’t last.

That was not the case, though. Instead, I relied on a regular curriculum of cocaine and alcohol to keep me painting. And while my name accumulated a certain degree of notoriety in both the Horror and Indie film communities, the rest of the world remained closed off to me because of my association with those same subcultures.

Things stayed at this new status quo for months, *Shock* a permanent home to my work and Carissa increasingly the only person I would confide in. The rest of the world felt... hostile. My family was back East, and the friends I’d made since moving to LaLaLand had become increasingly standoffish. Jealousy, Carissa suggested, and it was easier to believe that than admit what an arrogant cunt success had made of me.

Then came that meeting with Portlock about the sequel.

So there’s the little glass vial in front of me, and despite my curiosity, I said no. Justin didn’t like that at all. He downed the rest of his Glenfiddich and excused himself to the restroom. I should have seen it coming, but twenty minutes later I was paying the tab and leaving empty-handed. Well, not completely empty-handed - he’d left the vial.

I hired a car back to *Shock* and sat transfixed by the stuff in the vial the entire ride, the headlights of oncoming traffic illuminating it in brief blue and purple flashes. Whatever it was seemed to move of its own accord, a viscous purple demon suspended in what looked like water, but I was betting was alcohol - the kind you used to strip paint with. It looked like something a muppet might get blasted on. I tried to remember the name Justin had used for it, but couldn’t. Instead, my mind gave the stuff a nickname: Lava - like the lamp it resembled.

When I got back to Carissa’s little living space in the rear of the gallery, I found a note that she’d be out late. Whatever - we certainly didn’t have anything exclusive, and I needed time to work. I fired up the paints, cracked two beers - I always open two at the onset of a session - and tried to continue a new piece I’d been struggling with. My juices had been dry of late, though, and I found myself distracted by the mystery Portlock had foisted on me. It only took about a beer and a half for my frustrations to get the better of my inhibitions, and the cap came off that vial.

The lid was a screw-on, closed so tightly that it took me the better part of fifteen minutes to open it. Once I did, though, and the contents became exposed to the open air, all the liquid receded. I was confused, thinking there was a hole in the glass that the lid had somehow held in a vacuum, but no dice. I couldn’t for the life of me figure out *where the solution went*.

Without the suspension fluid, the contents dried up quickly. I mean, like, *instantaneously*. The purple gelatin settled in the bottom of the vial and I watched as it began to crystalize. Fascinated, I tilted the glass forty-five degrees and used my index finger to tap out a little chunk, which turned to bluish flakes the moment it hit the table.

From here, there was no going back. Yeah, it takes a special kind of moron to witness something like I’m describing and want to put it up their nose, but here we are and there I was. There’s just a part of my brain that finds it hard to say no to new drug experiences. I procured a credit card from my jacket pocket and chopped out two Ozzy-sized lines.

It’s hard to look back and accurately describe what that first Lava trip felt like. In my mind’s eye, I can vividly remember walking down a street in a thick, rolling fog. To my right, I could just barely make out the tall, chainlink fence that surrounded the iconic Silver Lake Reservoir. On my left, a broken-blacktop road wound upward on a small hill, cars parked along both sides and rendering a single lane hardly big enough for one car to pass, let alone two.

The neighborhood looked vaguely familiar. I strolled drunkenly down the center of the street counting porch lights until I found myself at a dead end. To my left, the sconce beside a large, double red front door flickered on and off. Strange, but I could swear this intermittence didn’t occur *until I noticed the house,* as though the house had chosen me.

I walked to the door and tried the knob. It turned the full one-eighty with hardly any effort and creaked open. I stepped into someone’s family room.

To my left was a small runner table adorned with knick-knacks: car keys, a wallet, a half- drank bottle of red wine. Further ahead, a large picture window peeked through a small gap in long, blackout drapes. I remember creeping upstairs and the image of Nancy in the first *Nightmare on Elm Street* came to me, her deep footprints in the marshmallow stairs of Freddy’s dream house. The carpet didn’t just absorb the sound of my steps, it muffled the screams I could hear in the back of my head. Because it wasn’t my head anymore, it was a door to another me. A different me.

*“That’s what they call it in the country where it’s made. It means Doorway.”*

Justin’s words heralded a darkness that, when I finally opened my eyes, revealed I was back at Shock, Carissa shaking me awake. I’d fallen asleep on the couch; the digital clock on the wall and it said 1:23 AM.

“Renn, did you do this?” she demanded, terror twisting her face into a caricature.

“Huh?” I raised my hands in front of my face and was horrified to see they were covered in dried blood. My heart leaped and my breath caught in my throat before I realized it was paint. I had flashes of working through the night, but also, of something else. An image came to me then, fleeting: a woman screaming, her hair wet and sticky with blood, thick black gore streaming from her eyes and nose, smearing across her face…

“Renn?”

The image dissolved. My stomach dropped. I tried to stand but lost my balance and fell onto my hands and knees, expelling the contents of my stomach in one Herculean blast of vomit that hit the floor in front of me with such force, chunks ricocheted back at me, splashed against my face and neck.

“Renn! Jesus!”

I collapsed onto my side, rolled over onto my back and lay staring at the ceiling. Carissa kept talking, but I couldn’t understand anything she said. The image of the Red Woman returned and with it this time that of a man, a dog, a bunkbed laying in splinters. Everywhere the vision showed me, the walls were coated in blood.

At some point, my senses relaxed and I once again became able to interact with my immediate surroundings. It was at this point I realized the look on Carissa’s face was not one of horror, but excitement.

“Renn, this is *incredible*, baby!”

Beside her, one of the new canvases Carissa had given me lay face-up on the floor, a hyper-realistic portrayal of the family room from my dream stretched across its surface - a room painted in blood, in the foreground the Red Woman from my vision, her neck slashed open and eyes gouged out.

I felt sick.

“This is us rich, baby!”

“Are you fucking serious?” I asked, my hypnotic disgust broken by the audacity of her statement. I grabbed the painting, intent on destroying it. Carissa intervened.

“Renn! Whoah! Hold on a second! What’s the matter?”

“This is… this is…” how could I tell her about the vision? How could I explain my sudden terror at the thought that this painting *had actually happened*? That I might have witnessed the scene, a ghostly memory forever staining the home where this woman and her family had once lived? It sounded insane.

“Renn, this is *you*, baby. You’ve found your voice. A few more of these, and I’ll finally be able to upgrade the gallery. There’s this enormous loft space in DTLA I’ve had my eye on for a couple months now. I think it’d be perfect for the new, improved *Shock*.”

That was my first clue that Carissa might be more interested in me as a retirement fund than a boyfriend. How she could even think about selling this, let alone what sick fuck would want to buy it, I couldn’t even guess. If this had come out of me, I had way more serious things to worry about than the fucking gallery.

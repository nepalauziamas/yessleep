Last Christmas, I wanted a puppy, but my mom gave me a goldfish instead.

"Take care of this fish first, and then we'll talk about getting a puppy." She said.

I was sad at first, but I love my little goldfish. I named him Cheeto, because he's orange like a Cheeto. I can spend hours just looking at him, and he states right back. I fed him every day at the same time, and then brought him to show and tell in spring.

Mikey Sylvester brought his goldfish too, but his was ginormous. It was like as big as his hand. My little goldfish was hardly the size of a thumb.

One of the kids in my class, Angela, asked him why his was so much bigger than mine and he said

"Well my dad says goldfish grow as big as the tank they're in. Connor's parents probably can't _afford_ a bigger tank" he laughed and some of the other kids joined in.

Mikey was always calling me poor. I can usually not let it get to me, like my mom says, but this time he was picking on Cheeto.

"Your goldfish is big and fat like you, and he probably has cancer!" I yelled back at him. My eyes wanted to cry, but I wouldn't let them.

The teacher heard me yell at him, and I got a note home to my mom.

"He said that we are poor, mama." I tried to explain

"That's no excuse. You need to control yourself, Connie."

"Well...maybe if we got a bigger tank it would shut him up"

"Connie, after your behavior, you're lucky you don't get a whooping. You're really asking for a bigger tank?"

"Yeah mom, please"

"Well maybe for your birthday."

"But my birthday is in October! I want the tank now, for Cheeto!"

"That's enough."

I think maybe Mikey is right, and we are poor. Our house is okay, and our car is okay. Maybe that's why my mom couldn't get the tank, and she just didn't want me to know.

I had to take matters into my own hands.

First I tried using a bathtub, but my sister yelled at me and told me he would flush him. Then I tried a drawer from my dresser, but the water leaked out and got all my socks wet. Finally, I came up with the best solution.

There is a big lake not far from my house. I could ride my bike there and bring food for Cheeto. It made me sad that I couldn't look at him whenever I wanted, but he could grow HUGE in that lake.

My mom always says that sometimes we had to do tough things for our family. This was a tough thing I could do for Cheeto.

I fed him extra food one day, then scooped him into a little cup. I peddled as fast as I could down to the lake, and put Cheeto in. I told him.

"It's okay Cheeto, I'll be back to feed you tomorrow. Have fun in your new home."

I sat and watched him swim a little, but then he swam off and I couldn't see him anymore. I went home.

The next day, I packed myself a ham sandwich and Cheeto's food and went off to the lake. I wanted to sit and spend some time with him which is why I brought my sandwich.

I waited and waited for a whole hour, and I was getting worried that something had happened to Cheeto. 

In school they say some fish eat other fish. That seems wrong. We don't eat other people. Well Mikey said that some people do, but he's a big, fat liar.

I was real sad when I finally saw Cheeto swim up towards the shore. He was looking bigger already! I guess Mikey doesn't lie about everything.

He was a little less orange, and his front fins looked too long, but he was my Cheeto! Already as big as my hand! All that extra food must have helped.

I grabbed his fish flakes and sprinkled a bunch in the water. Then I sat down to eat my sandwich with him.

He didn't like his fish flakes no more. Probably he found some yummy food in the lake he liked.

I tried giving him some breadcrumbs too and he wouldn't take them.

When I dropped a piece of ham in the water though, he went crazy for it! His mouth opened so big and he just munched down on it.

My mom says I need a lot of protein to get big and strong, probably Cheeto does too!

I would bring food to him every day for a whole week. I started by adding extra ham to my sandwich to give to him, then I had to switch and give him part of my dinner. He only liked the meat, so I would eat all the rest.

He grew so fast, he must've been the size of my FOOT.

When my mom found out Cheeto wasn't in his tank, she got real mad. I got grounded, and she told me I couldn't just get rid of him because he was small. I tried to tell her about the lake, but she was too mad at me. She said I'll never get a puppy now.

I'll show her when she sees Cheeto next time.

One day I went to the lake and there were a bunch of feathers all over the place. Some birds must've got into a fight or something. I think they scared Cheeto, because he wouldn't take the dinner I brought him.

He was already real big by then, maybe the size of my leg.

He didn't eat much after that, but he still kept getting bigger. I figured maybe someone was throwing some food in the lake he was getting. As long as he is happy, I don't care where he gets his food!

I started noticing a lot of flyers about missing pets in my neighborhood. I felt bad that those people were having so much trouble with their pets, when Cheeto was doing so good.

His front fins were so long now they looked like legs, and he could drag himself up on the shore a bit for me to pet him sometimes. I would bring little snacks of ham, which he would take for rewards when he did tricks.

He can jump out of the water, he comes when I called him, he can roll over. I don't even need a puppy anymore. He was huge now, bigger than me!

One day, Mr. Johnson, who lives by the lake, came down and said.

"You been spending a lot of time down here, boy. I seen you these past few months. Now I don't know what yer doing, but this here is private property."

I was a little worried about Mr. Johnson. My mom told me he didn't like people like us. I guess she meant poor people.

"Oh I'm sorry, Mr. Johnson. You see, my goldfish lives in the lake."

He must've thought it was funny because he started laughing. "Ain't no goldfish living in that lake. Ain't nothing could live in that lake. Quit telling tales boy."

"But he does! Look I can call him" and I called "Cheeto!", But I didn't have a treat to give him.

Mr. Johnson seemed curious and walked up to the shore to look for him.

I guess Cheeto liked Mr. Johnson, because he came up and jumped and hugged Mr. Johnson, and pulled him in for a swim. 

They were swimming for a long time, so I decided to go home.

Mr. Johnson never asked me about Cheeto again, so he must believe me. Maybe him and Cheeto still go on swims.

It's been a few months now, and Cheeto is still getting bigger. By the time show and tell comes around, he'll probably be as big as a car!

I was worried about how I would get him to school, but he can come all the way out of the water now! His back fin is still a fin, though, so he kind of scoots. 

His teeth have gotten real big too. I could hardly see them when I brought him to the lake, now they're bigger than he was!

Anyway Reddit, I wanted to share with you because I have so long to wait for show and tell. Maybe I'll bring my mom out to meet Cheeto. They could go for a swim, and I think they'd both have fun.

Do you want to go for a swim with him?

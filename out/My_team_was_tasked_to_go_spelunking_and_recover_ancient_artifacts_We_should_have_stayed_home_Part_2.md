So. That thing had found us. While Riley and I were having our troubles, Jared and Alison had theirs. This is what happened on their end, as far as they told me. Jared stared down the dark cavern. “Shouldn't we go after him? I think he's learned his lesson.”

Alison gave a little scoff. “Yeah, right. Just leave him. He's been high and mighty this whole trip, I think he could use a little humbling.”

Jared heard that sound again. A sort of static  ruffle coming from the walkies.

“Haven't you been hearing that noise?”

“It's fine, you're just paranoid. We'll get random feedback down here sometimes. By the way, was Alex right earlier? Do you really believe that guy's stories?”

“I dunno, somewhat I guess. I just don't know how to explain all this any other way, he seemed quite terrified during the report. There has to be some sort of– thing– wandering around here, protecting something.”

“If there was, why wouldn't it have killed him?”

“I dunno, maybe it wasn't hungry that day or something.”

“Look, I get it. We've all seen the pictures of those murals. With ancient Latin, cults and all that. Besides, I'm just wondering how the hell anyone thought it was a good idea to build anything down here.” Alison said.

“Agreed there, I just… Wait, tell me you see that at least, Alison?” He pointed.

“...Are those lights?”

A group of lights were heading down the cave, from the direction where they had entered some hours ago. Three heavily armed agents strode into our set up. They had full face helmets and body armor. Their armor seemed strange, familiar somehow. These strangers aimed weapons immediately, strange ones, seemingly made to be effective underwater.

“Identification. Slowly.” One said from under their helmet.

Jared and Alison raised their hands and complied.

The agent studied their badges while the other two aimed. He scanned the IDs with his equipment. “Yep, this is the Delta Squad. I'm Commander Fairweather. These are my soldiers, Henderson and Moon. At ease,” They lowered their weapons. “We're Elite Team C, given orders to extract remaining Delta Squad members. Forgive the charged entrance, but you're all in danger.”

Something seemed off with the way he said those words. Something didn't seem right.

“Where are the other two soldiers from your squad?” Henderson said as she glanced behind herself.

Jared and Alison exchanged a look.

“They're down setting up lights at the ruin entrance. If I may ask, who are you? I'm in charge here as far as I know.” Alison said.

“How long have the other two been gone?” Fairweather said, ignoring the last.

“About an hour or so, Sir.” Jared said.

“Fine. Let's move. Delta, ahead of us. Weapons at the ready Team C.” Fairweather said.

“I hope you brought your own diving gear…” Alison mumbled.

Jared was hearing that sound again, but no one else seemed to be reacting. “Have you heard of these guys?” He whispered.

Alison shook her head as they moved. If they were extracting them, why wasn't one of these soldiers bringing them out? It didn't feel like any sort of rescue, but there wasn't much of a choice.

\~

“Like my work?” The thing above me muttered.

I was stunned, Riley was stunned. We sat still. My radio was making the constant sound of that feedback.

“What are you?” I asked the thing.

“A helper,” It said simply. “It has been a long rest. I will adorn my palace with all of you soon, my little presents. You are the very last letter I need, *Alex*.”

“...Letter?”

“Yes, letters, Alex. It is not as it should be, perhaps, but your language will do. Mine is the father. Your first letter will do, it must, that is the way. It is time to awaken.”

Riley and I exchanged a look.

“What do you want?”

It smiled wider, causing more blood to leak from its mouth.

“I already said, *Alex*. **You**.”

It lunged. I didn't even have time to see more than a blur. There was a claw grabbing at me, but I had just enough wits left to dodge. I moved aside and slashed outward with my boot knife, leaving a wound across a stringy arm. It didn't seem too bothered though.

As I backed up I saw it more clearly. It was… something that looked like another agent. Something was itching at the back of my head. Had I seen him before?

The human part of it stood like a puppet, and had two additional arms and legs of sinewy length protruding from the ripped uniform. His face was muddled, barely recognizable, with a cut that made the bloody smile wide.

It used all four arms to swipe in a furious frenzy. I could only dodge some of them, one strike slashing me across the shoulder and one my arm as I backed up. It lunged for me and by instinct I aimed my flashlight. The creature squealed and missed. I started to swim out of the citadel. The strikes had been at the wrong angle and only dented my suit. Any longer in the ring with that creature though, and it would've been a different story.

“Where are you going?” The thing churned.

I dropped my powerful flashlight inside the room, but I still had my helmet light. Thoughts raced as my flippers carried me into the open water.

Just what the hell was going on here? Did HQ send us into death? Why did that thing look like an agent?

I swam behind part of the building, using an ornate carving as cover. I remembered the radio, still making noise, and I shut it off. I turned out my remaining lights too. The strong flashlight I had left behind allowed me to see the thing as it lumbered out. It was shaped like an offensively large spider, standing upright. The head dipped to the side as it bent down, and started to move. It bent like some amphibious mangle, its unnatural patterns were disturbing. I silenced the urge to curse at the grotesque sight as it looked for me.

The sounds it made as it moved were just as strange, as if it were made of weak wood, limbs creaking.

“Alex… Alex…” It teased, voice burbling in the water.

Its repeating of my name slowly quieted as it went away, towards the farthest corners. I crept back into the citadel when I gathered the courage. With her shoulder free, Riley had somehow managed to pull her left arm out of the ropes, and was working at the other two. I ran up the podium and helped her. Riley's wrist was red and chaffed.

Once we both lowered to the ground, I had Riley lean on me for her injuries.

“Just what the hell is that thing?” I said.

“Just wait until– you meet the second one.”

“There's two?” I stammered.

“Yep. Except the other one can't see. It has some sort of film over its eyes,” Riley said. “I'm not sure if the one we just met can. If it can see, it's not very well. You might have blinded it with that flashlight. Though I don't think that they had much use for eyes down here anyway.”

“Is your suit compromised?” I asked.

“I don't think so. I might feel the pressure down here somewhat, but I think I'll be all right for an hour or so.”

I hooked one of my oxygen tanks to Riley's back. The mask luckily has its own built in regulator, hence why Riley was just able to not drown being dragged. All I had to do was hook up the tubes from the oxygen tank to the suit's helmet. Though now my air supply was less than half. I picked up my flashlight.

We readied ourselves to swim out of the citadel. Once we crept out, if it wasn't for Riley's floodlights, we likely would have been lost.

“My long distance radio emits strange feedback when those things are near.” I said as I switched it back on.

“Mine did too, but it broke while that thing was dragging me away. I think it used the sound to find me. I'm just glad my local comms stayed in one piece.” Riley said.

Just then, the radio blipped with that noise. I shut it off and I saw a swimming shadow in the distance, it was coming towards us.

“Down.” Riley said. I clicked off my lights.

We ducked down against the wall of our current stone building, and the thing stopped. The vague shadow I could see looked like it might have once been a person too. Only, it was beyond mangled. It crept down the wall like a spider, only a few feet away from us. Something hung from its chest and dangled above our heads. I could see that there was a strange film over its eyes. It must be the blind one then.

I took a risk. I clicked on my light.

After a few frozen seconds the thing didn't notice at all. I shone it carefully up at the creature, wishing I hadn't. The thing on its chest was a dog tag, reading, ‘Desmond Quarter, Beta Team’.

I glanced at Riley, and we shared the same idea: there had been other teams here before us.

The creature did eventually leave us, leaping amongst the distant heights until it disappeared.

When I clicked on my radio, we started to hear voices over it.

It was hard to tell, but I thought that there were figures at the floodlights, just at the water's edge. I had to force myself not to swim frantically towards them. Had Alison and Jared come to help us? I had to warn them about these monsters. I tried my radio.

“Jared, Alison, you there?”

The strange residue was quieter than before, but it was there.

“Yeah, Alex. Good to hear from you. We're here in the city. Where are you?” Alison said.

“Riley and I are swimming away from the citadel. We're both injured, but she's worse off than me. The things that attacked us weren't… human.”

There was a pause.

“We'll get you help, we're pretty close to you. You can tell us about these attackers then. By the citadel, you mean that center building, right?”

“Right, I take it you can see it from the floodlights at the mouth?”

“We're already in the city… we're not by the mouth at all.”

There was a crashing then, shattering sounds that trailed into the water. Riley and I peeked out from the stone openings and saw the source. One by one, the bright floodlights were falling. The figure doing it suddenly did not seem so human after all.

“I guess that the first one can see after all…” Riley muttered.

“We're the only ones. That's not one of ours.” I heard another voice say, as if beside Alison. It wasn't Jared, who was it?

“What do you see?” Alison asked.

“It must be one of those things. They're both using the bodies of some agents we don't recognize. We saw one wearing a dog tag, it said, ‘Desmond Quarter, Beta Team’.” I said.

“What are we dealing with here?” Jared asked, trying to keep his cool.

“Stay down, Delta two and Delta four. Don't let it see you.” Another unfamiliar voice said.

“One passed us by but didn't notice us. It can't see, but the other one can. Both of them cause our radios to go on the fritz. The first one we saw said something about needing letters, decorating its palace with us. It said *I* was the ‘last letter’ it needed.”

“They can speak–?” Jared squealed. The residue was behind his words. He was interrupted like someone had clamped a hand over his mouth. “Quiet. Lights off.” Alison hissed.

I heard that now familiar sound, and recognized it despite it being over the comms. It was the soft, sinewy squelch of creaking limbs that the creatures had exhibited. Then their radios clicked off. Even Riley and I felt the need to be quiet. A voice gurgled over my radio.

*“Alex… Riley… Where oh where did you go, sweetlings–”*

I turned off the radio.

Even though we weren't all together in that moment, we all waited in the same silence for the thing to pass. The last flood light at the mouth of the cave collapsed with a crash, and nearly all was dark. Only two lights were left on, my flashlight, and the floodlight dragged into the street.

I clicked on the radio again. The residue was quieter. “I think it's gone,” Alison said. “Alex, Riley, what's your location?”

I clicked my light twice down the row of buildings. We were near the floodlight, so it likely wouldn't have caught the eye of the creatures. I hoped.

“Got it. On our way.”

After a few minutes we saw shadows swimming around the corner of a nearby building. There was Jared, Alison, and three others. The three made it up to us first, and aimed weapons. It looked somewhat ridiculous with them paddling their feet to stay level in the water.

“It's all right, that's them.” Alison said from behind. They were close enough now for all of us to talk over local comms.

The three heavily armored figures stared before lowering their strange harpoon-like guns.

“Alex, Riley, this is Elite Team C…” Alison said. She gave the slightest shake of her head. That was her way of telling us that she didn't know who they were, or what they were doing to her.

“I'm Commander Fairweather. This is Moon, and Henderson.” One of the soldier said.

“Elite Team C?” I asked.

“Correct,” Moon said. “We'll talk later. For now, we need to move. Bring us to that citadel.”

“The citadel? I thought you said we were getting the hell out of here.” Alison demanded in a furious whisper.

“We are. We just need to verify the identity of the bodies there.”

Riley and I were careful not to change our expressions. We hadn't said a damn thing about any bodies.

“Bodies?” Alsion said.

“I told you something was up.” Jared muttered.

“All right, enough talk. Show us. Now.” Fairweather said.

I wasn't eager to go back there, but I obeyed.

I led them to the citadel. When we got to the base of it, that Fairweather guy stopped us. “No use making Delta two swim further in their injured state. Moon, Henderson, escort the rest of them up there and take notes. I'll wait here with Delta two and Delta one.”

“I am *not* going up there.” Jared said.

Moon swam a little closer. “Yes. You are.”

The situation had become somewhat tense then… We were pretty confused. We all shared unspoken questions like, who were these soldiers? What did they want? Why did they seem to have their weapons on us now? In the end, we didn't have much of a choice. As the ones mentioned, Jared and I followed Moon and Henderson. We swam just above where the steps were, with all lights off. We had to use our night vision, and I assumed that this Elite Team had it too. I had just a moment with Jared.

“What's going on? Who are these guys?”

“I don't know, they just stormed into camp with those weapons and made us swim here,” Jared said. “They said they were getting us out, but… We've gotta figure a way out of this, Alex…”

We didn't see either creature along the way, but that was more worrying than not. We landed in the main chamber. I was trying to think of a plan. Jared froze at what we saw here.

“Dear God in heaven…”

“He can't hear you down here, we made it hell apparently. Reception's not great…” I muttered.

“Now isn't exactly the time for jokes.” Jared said.

“What other time is there?”

“Delta squad, shut the hell up.” Henderson said.

Moon brought out a waterproof tablet identical to our team's and began typing. “Delta four, get up there and check the victims pockets for ID.” There wasn't room in the tone to disobey.

I turned on my flashlight. Looting bodies was hard enough, but these ones had clearly been sitting for quite a while, and had a stench on top of their disturbing dismemberment.

By order of HQ all of its agents are tasked to have two forms of ID. A security badge, and dog tags. I checked in those places first and sure enough, there were both on each body. So these people were agents of HQ…

“Are you really gonna get us out of here?” Jared said.

“Names.” Moon snapped, ignoring him.

I was stunned by the first name.

“Margaret West,” like Myles West… with the flash drive. Hell, like *Alison West*.

“Oliver May,”

“Rachel Hiker,”

“Sam Walker…” I said.

I took a moment to read the last part of their IDs, “All from either Alpha or Beta squads”.

Jared and I exchanged a look. We had the same thoughts too, I could see it. With these plus that creature's dog tags, it was obvious now. Our designation, Delta, we were the fourth squad to come here from HQ. They had claimed no one else had come here before, that our designation was just a protocol, but no. There had already been an Alpha, Beta, and Charlie squad. Though, there were no Charlie squad members here.

“That's it… It's almost complete then. Though three are missing, that's odd.” Moon said to Henderson.

That feedback from my radio picked up.

“Jared…” I said, warning, but he didn't hear me.

“What do you mean, almost complete? You've got your names, now get us out of here!” Jared said.

“I'm afraid we can't do that, Delta three. We're not here to save you.” Henderson didn't leave room for a response as she shot her sidearm into the air. The bullet created brief beams as it ricocheted in the dark.

“What the hell are you doing–?” Jared was about to continue, but something interrupted him, besides his own scream that is.

Something landed on the citadel. My radio was going crazy. Then limbs crept out from the entrance, then the head of the beast. It was the blind one, film over where its eyes should be.

“The letters you need are down here. Come and get them so we can leave.” Moon said.

Even though the agent tried to keep a calm tone, it was clear that Moon was afraid.

“Letters?” The thing's voice was even rougher than the other's.

“Yes, letters. Now get down here before–” The thing leapt.

It could have struck Jared down easily, but it completely ignored him, and slashed across Agent Moon. It nipped with teeth and claws, but the creature was almost delicate, only attacking to kill, and kept Moon whole.

“What the shit?!” Henderson cried out, clicking her radio. “Fairweather, we have a problem, the creatures are after us.” She began firing.

Bullets slashed across the creature's flesh, but it only seemed to make it angrier. As soon as it was done with Moon, it was after Henderson.

I shook myself from my stunned state and glanced at the floor. Moon's weapon had slid across the ground to be near me. I ducked down and grabbed it as a limb of the creature swept wide of me. When I had the weapon I ran back to Jared and pulled him along.

“Go, go!”

We swam out of the citadel. Henderson's fire stopped, and we heard a scream.

We worked our way to the bottom of the building. We looked to where Fairweather, Riley, and Alison would be and there they were. Jared held out an arm to stop me and pulled me aside. I saw it. Fairweather had his gun leveled at Riley and Alison both. They were disarmed with their hands up.

All of us waited for the thing to leave the citadel, and soon, it was silent.

“Keep those hands up,” Fairweather whispered. “I'd hate to shoot.”

Apparently in the commotion, he hadn't seen Jared or I fumble down the steps. We were caught between a hostile soldier and a monstrous creature out there.

*“What do we do?”* Jared's look plead.

I led Jared behind Fairweather. Riley saw us creeping up but didn't so much as flinch.

“Why– are you doing this?” She growled through her injuries. “Who are you?”

“Elite Team C. Tasked with making sure the ritual finishes. I'd keep my voice down if I were you.”

“What ritual?” Alison demanded.

“I have nothing more to say to you. The knowledge won't help you any–”

I cut him off as Jared kicked him. The soldier was quick, but not quick enough in the water. We wrangled silently in the water. It wasn't too glorious. Jared eventually managed to wrap his arms under Fairweather's to constrict him, and covered his mouth. Alison swept in with a bouncing kick straight into the man's stomach, muting his struggles. The armor didn't help him too much there.

I stepped up and aimed the weapon at him, and this made Fairweather freeze. Jared pulled wrist ties from a pouch and pinned Fairweather's hands behind his back.

“Thanks, that was close.” Alison said.

“What is going on?” Jared muttered.

Fairweather stayed silent.

“Let's move. We can question the guy when we find a safe spot.” I said.

“There is no safe spot in this place.” Jared said.

“Saf*er*, then. Come on.” Alison said.

Alison handed Fairweather's rifle to Riley. The city had fallen silent again. We hauled Fairweather off and moved as quietly as we could. Soon we were off in a much darker part of the city. All of us but Alison turned off her headlamps, who set hers to dim. Jared and I had to turn off night vision. Using that much suit battery earlier was a bad idea.

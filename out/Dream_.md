I am watching tv ,it’s a pretty lame serial where the couple is fighting. Their voice somehow keeps on increasing without me not clicking the remote , it keeps on getting screechy and the tv shuts all together . The room is now filled with deafening silence , so much so that I can hear my heartbeats through my eardrum .

 my phone suddenly starts ringing and I’m pulled out of the eeriness of the situation. I wonder who decided to call me at 2am in midnight . The screen displays the name of one of my friends, “hello” I answer , “hey  , why are you roaming out of your house at this time of the night “ . Before I could reply the phone cut and out went all the lights. Its pitch black and silent all over the room. I can feel my heart throbbing faster like something weird is going on. 


As I’m in the trail of my thoughts, I hear a faint singing from the corner of my house . My gut drops . I hear the sound more clearly as it moves closer , it’s a song that I don’t recognize , but somehow it feels melodious at that point . It gets closer, I try to call my friend again , but there’s no network this time 


 I can now feel that it's just out of my room , and then a horrific realization strikes ….i had left my window open .In the state of panic I decide to duck under that window so that , ‘the thing ‘ won’t be able to see me , or at least I won’t be able to see it …. 


I’m stuck to the wallbelow the window like a lizard , as I hear it's just a meter away from me  , I catch my breath as I feel it just above me , silent , like it was holding its breath too . I physically feel the time slowing down , and my heartbeat getting faster and faster as I wait in anticipation .Then something splashes inside my window , and I have it over me, it seems like a thick liquid and the smell makes me nauseous …..Blood. 


 My feet start acting faster than my brain and in one motion I’m on my feet opening the bedroom . As I open the door I try to find the switch of lights , after wandering for a while I finally find it and switch on all the lights . to my surprise the singing has stopped altogether … 


I grab my bike keys and make a run for my bike , as soon as I sit on it the lights go out again , and to my dismay the bike felt 100kgs heavier and wouldn’t start . Then something is thrown at me from a dark corner, near my feet. I’m scared even to look, but I do, it's an old ragged doll with its head burnt. My hands turn stone cold. I am unable to feel the handles of my bike , as a result it falls off . I run towards the room which has a door that leads outside, I fidget with the door knob, but relief washes over me as it opens swiftly . 


As I’m about to run out on the open muddy way , I hear the door behind me shut close .  and then I hear a sound so horrific that it makes my skin pale and my brain freeze 


From the room behindme , I hear a collective voice of people chanting ominously . I can feel my body not moving , my breath stops and my heart gives up .  In the most unexpected move , I start moving towards the door. I feel that I am not in charge of my body  , my body was not mine anymore …. 


My hands rest on the door knob….  the chants just have grown louder and intense . In one motion I open the door , the whole room on display . I see them; I see 6 pairs of eyes looking at me ….. And there was nothing human about those stares. I am taken towards them, my body fully out of my control, as if I’m tied by an invisible rope . 


I now stand in the middle of the room with them looking up at me . I feel nothing but dread and death . As a last resort I start chanting a prayer that my mom taught me as a child  …and as soon as I'm on the 4th verse the lights spill into the room. My body feels like it’s a bit in control, but to my dismay I still feel those eyes on me , and I decide to look back . 


First my eyes fall on a small boy , who now looks like any other normal kid. My eyes register 4 more adults sitting in the room  but somehow my eyes remain glued on the kid, unable to move to others . The lights again go out , and again I see six fiery stares in my direction . I feel a tight clench on my body , I'm breathing less and less . With my last hope, I again begin my prayers , but louder and with all the energy that’s left in me , the light comes again and their chants stop. I keep my eyes closed and continue the prayer , however I feel my voice disappear , and in such a way that it's less than a whisper , I open my eyes , which automatically land on the kid . 


The kid now  has a devilish smile on his face, he slowly reaches out to hands of what seems like his mother ,my eyes fall
down and  I notice that his small hands were burnt down till his red flesh was visible . As soon as I take my gaze to his eyes again , he initiates the chants , and others follow , the chants grow ominous and fill the room , my body loses its control again as I see the kid's mouth getting bigger and wider , to the point where it reaches up to his chest . The lights go out as I start feeling hot as if I’m set on fire . I close my eyes and give in to whatever awaits me . I feel a hand grab my feet and the grip keeps on getting tighter and tighter till I cannot feel my legs 


When I open my eyes I am woken up by the concerned look of my brother shaking my feet.  I still was out of breath  and my body felt like it had taken a bath in its own sweat. I glance all over my room to find everything normal and in its place . I give out a sigh of relief . My brother says I was mumbling something loudly in my sleep and that’s what woke him up 


  it's almost 4 am at night , I get freshened up . When I decide to go back to sleep , I unlock my phone to get my mind off the bad dream, but  it displays a window of recent incoming calls  …my eyes don’t believe what’s displayed on the screen . it’s the incoming call of my friend at 2 am

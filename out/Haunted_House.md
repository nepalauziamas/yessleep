Years ago back in the late 90s, I dated this woman who owned her own house, and was trying to sell it. It was an older house (built around 1947) that had been remodeled once before in the late 70s to a modern look (for the time). 

Now her (we’ll call her Jane) and her ex husband had to do a lot of the work themselves, with her father who was an all around handyman. 

She had told me that when they were remodeling, they found the house had no insulation in the walls, just old newspaper stuffed in the walls. Apparently it was a way cheap contractors would substitute actual insulation back then (around 1947 or so), and the people who had done the reno in the 70s tore down the plaster & put in drywall, but were cheap & left the newspaper. So Jane & her ex had to tear it all down & put actual insulation in. 

Here’s where it gets weird. Apparently when they were removing the old newspaper, they found what looked like bloody rags and clothes in the walls with it all. They just assumed a worker had gotten hurt & they tried to hide it by stuffing the stuff in the walls, but the more they tore into it, the more they found. They contacted the police, who just told them the work was obviously done without a permit & it was probably a the old contractor hiding evidence so they didn’t get caught. 

Well after about four months the reno was done & the got to move in. She said almost immediately they stated hearing crazy noises, especially at night when it was quiet. Specifically the sound of someone screaming and the sound of some kind of power tools running. At first they wrote it off as someone in the neighborhood watching a movie too loud. It kept happening, so they thought someone was pranking them. They looked around for hidden speakers but found none. They went outside and listened to see it was someone out there, but found nothing. 

It got to the point where their friends wouldn’t stay over, and eventually stopped coming over, because they heard it too & were scared to even be in the house. At this point she found out her ex was having an affair & kicked him out. They got divorced later on. She got so scared of the place, she moved in with her mother who lived about 20 minutes away. 

It figured she was effing with me & just trying to scare me, so I stayed the night with her. I’ll be damned m, I heard the same damn creepy ass noises, just as she described them. Yup I was freaked out. The next morning I searched high & low for anything that could explain it. It found nothing at all. I even did what she did & went outside on a different night, listening for ANYTHING that sounded even remotely like what I heard, but found nothing. 

About a week later, we went back to clean around the house for the realtor, and I was in a mission. I took down heating vents, looked in the vents for wires or speakers, took off & put back floor moldings, traced any exposed wires I could find, went into the attic and did the same. I spent a good 2-3 hours looking, but found nothing. 

When I came down from the attic Jane said, find anything?  I said no, and I just couldn’t believe it. There had to be SOMETHING that someone was effing with her/us with. Then it happened, all of the sudden the entire ceiling  started shaking, and someone (thing) was stomping on it, and I heard screaming saying please help me, why won’t you help me, you were just tight here, please get me out!  

I jumped up, looked at her & said that’s it. I’m done, I’m outta here, eff this. I grabbed her hand & pulled her out with me, jumped in the car and sped off, never returning again. 

She just kept glaring at me & saying NOW DO YOU BELIEVE ME?  I told you, I effing told you. 
She ended up lowing the price & selling it with the rest of the furniture in it, just to get rid of it. 

To this day, it was the scariest damn thing ive ever had happen.

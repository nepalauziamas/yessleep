This all started when my wife, Meg, and I had discussed cutting cut down on some of our streaming subscriptions (among other expenses).

I had been away for a conference for a few days and when I walked in, she was staring at the TV, her brown eyes wide, taking in every second of it. She was watching one of those shows that follows people as they choose a house. We'd watch these kinds of shows all the time, we’d try and guess which house they’d pick, so I looked over as I put away my keys and jacket.

Something was wrong that made me do a double-take. The realtor looked like someone had run her over with a lawnmower. She was bleeding from fresh looking gashes on her face, neck, and chest and a puddle had formed on the pristine white carpet of the home she was showing. She and the couple left footprints in it as they walked, I could even hear the faint wet squelching noise of them stepping on the areas where it had saturated the carpet. They all acted as if this totally normal and the realtor had a huge smile on her face. Maybe this was a horror movie based on the TV show? I looked at Meg out of the corner of my eye, if she thought this was abnormal her face certainly didn’t reflect that. She’s very squeamish and hates anything violent or gory, so I was surprised.

I decided to unpack a bit – maybe I was imaging it due to the jetlag mixed with exhaustion. When I came back in the living room, though, the realtor was writing some sort of weird symbols on the wall using her own blood, all the while having a seamless conversation about how many full bathrooms the house had.

“...the fuck?” I muttered

“Right?”, Meg gave a little laugh, not taking her eyes off the TV, “I don’t know why some realtors show houses so far above their budget. Why do they need four bathrooms for two people?”

As we do most nights, we ate while watching TV, but unlike most nights, I had lost my appetite. I stared down into my bowl, the red of the spaghetti sauce and way it had splattered against the white bowl as I had spooned it in just wasn’t sitting right with me. I couldn’t help but see the bloody carpet and the couple traipsing through it. Meg was eating unphased, like we had seen any normal show. I started getting worried, was it just me?

Man, the show was weird. The music, colors, and logo were a bit ‘off’ for lack of a better word. The recap and other voice overs from the usually gentle sounding narrator were aggressive and she at one point called the couple “undeserving of his attention and consumption”, but other than that and whatever the hell you’d describe what the realtor was doing, the format itself was just like any other episode.

In case you were wondering, they chose the last house, the one I had walked in in time to see. When the show did the portion where they show the couple fully moved in, the blood was still on the wall, places that looked like they had perhaps flaked off had fresher looking blood filling in the gaps. The couple had placed their bed under it like it was some sort of macabre ‘Live Laugh Love’ wall art.

“So, uh, what’d you think?”, I asked her, hoping she’d say something to make me feel less crazy.

“I still don’t know why they needed four bathrooms.” she smiled, brushing a strand of hair out of her face.

I noticed a nasty looking cut on her palm, “What happened to your hand?”

“Oh yeah, I cut myself prepping lunch the other day – you know me”, she laughed, waving it off.

The next night, after we were both off work, I could hear her watching one of those wedding dress shows while cooking. I was reviewing my notes for an upcoming work presentation in the next room, but from what I could overhear, it sounded normal enough.

I stuck my head out in time to watch the mother of the bride to be take a knife and slowly, carefully, carve off a long strip of flesh from her ankle to her hip with a glowing smile on her face. She then proceeded to tie it around the waist of the dress her daughter was trying on, like a sash. As the lower half of the dress (taffeta? Or was it tulle?) slowly changed from white to pink and then red, the salesperson laughed and said, “Looks like you’ve found your something borrowed!” She said yes to that dress.

Meg was watching from the kitchen and smiling, stirring something with one hand, the other over her heart like she had just witnessed something touching.

The next day, as I was heading out to work, she had a show playing on her third monitor while she worked on the other two – it was one of those home flipping shows. I hovered in the door frame behind her, curious. The host was talking about how she needed to prep the house for him, she was knocking down a wall because the house had an odd number of doors and without an even number of doors, he would not be able to enter. I was relieved to finally see a normal show, even if the potential buyer sounded a bit crazy about doors. It was funny, Meg had stopped working for a moment and it looked immersed, and then like she was taking notes.

At first, I was convinced that I had imagined the unsettling content. I was working long hours, still working through jetlag, and probably just losing it. Why my stress was manifesting in the form of some demonic home and gardening shows was beyond me.

That night, she wanted to watch a new season of a show we had been waiting for on a different streaming platform, but I suggested we watched the flipping show from earlier. I mentioned vaguely that I had seen some of it before and wanted to see how it ended. We watched it from the beginning. There was the piece about the doors that I had seen and, the host said something about “in order for him to find the entrance you needed to guide him with an offering”. There was a montage of her and the contractor drilling into the cement subfloor and then digging beneath it while upbeat music played. They dug further, and further, other members of the crew joining in, shoveling dark soil out of the hole. Then, to my abject horror, the contractor climbed into the hole, and sat down in the darkness. The host and the crew began pouring cement over him. He laughed as the pooling cement began to approach his nose and mouth – his final words were muffled but sounded like “This house going to look so good with the new hardwood!”

The host laughed cheerfully as the man disappeared into his cement tomb, “Bye Bob, we’ll be seeing you!” She turned towards the camera, and ended the episode with, “We’ll come back and level this off tomorrow so we can lay down our hardwood. Maybe we’ll even have some time to paint the foyer! Stay tuned for his glorious return, Michael!”

Meg yawned.

“Uh.... Meg what did they do? I zoned out and missed some of it.” I lied – I needed to hear her describe what we just witnessed in her own words, for my sanity. I tried to keep my voice from shaking.

“They had to fix the foundation, so that was most of the episode. Oh! And at the beginning they tore down a wall to an extra closet make the master bedroom bigger.”

I stared her. It had to be me, right? What she described sounded perfectly normal, but was not what I had just witnessed...

“Are you okay, Mike?” she asked, concern on her face, “You’re looking a bit pale – should you stay home from work tomorrow?”

I debated whether or not to tell her what I had seen, I decided not to. I figured, I’d finish my presentation at work, and wait until things were calmer to see if it was stress related. I also vaguely wondered if she was playing some weird prank on me.

We decided to watch the premier of our show on the other streaming service next. When she exited out, I noticed that we hadn’t been watching Netflix at all, which surprised me.

“Wait, what were we just watching?”

She perked up, always one for a sale or discount, “Isn’t it great? I found it on our TV while you were gone, and it’s free! It has all the same shows as Netflix, including the exclusives! I’ve been checking it out to see if we can cancel our Netflix subscription.”

That can’t be legal, I thought to myself, but said. “Can you show me how to get there?”

She navigated back to it, sure enough it was one of the options. The logo was like a desaturated version of the Netflix logo but with some weird symbol, the name was – well, I can’t find the characters on the keyboard or even online to copy/paste it out here.

We watched our show on the other service and it was totally, utterly normal. I felt so relieved at time time – clearly it wasn’t me that was crazy, we just had some strange bootleg version of Netflix and it was a parody of our usual shows, with top notch special effects. I slept so well that night.

But then things got weirder.

The other night, when Meg went to her moms house for a few hours, I decided to watch something – my presentation was over, it had gone well, and I was ready to tune in for a night of relaxation and junk food. I noticed we no longer had Netflix installed – I guess Meg had uninstalled the app? So, I decided, whatever, I’d tune into that weird knockoff, see what else they had.

I decided to put on something mindless, it was a show where contestants try and bake stuff way beyond their skill level with way too little time, but it’s lighthearted and everyone seems to enjoy it.

The normally bright and bubbly host started by gesturing to an empty chair and gave some sort of nonsense introduction for their ‘guest judge'. The contestants needed to start by making a cookie with their faces on it. The host said to make sure they put a bit of themselves into it. The funny thing was I had seen this episode before, but I figured I’d re-watch it.

I went in search of snacks and came back in time to see the finished products – one contestant was pale, her mascara streaked down her face as she took quick shallow breaths. A blood-filled glove on her hand, but she looked pleased otherwise.

The hosts took a bite.

“Hmmm, chewy texture, but good overall”, one said thoughtfully as he turned to speak to the camera. “You must bleed for him, Michael.”, he added.

The next contestant had… actually… How do I put this? Removed most of his actual face and draped it over the top of the cookie. Literally.

“Wonderful! You made the right decision; you have given the most and therefore have won the prize provided by our special guest” The host told him.

The contestant made some sort of grotesque expression with what was left of their face that I believed to be a smile, and then passed out.

There’s only so much gore I can take. If every single show was like this, I decided was going to tell Meg we’d either eat the fee for Netflix, or just find new shows because sometimes you just want to sit down and watch something that doesn’t involve very realistic looking mutilation, sometimes, you just want to watch people make some cookies.

I had misplaced the remote so I started searching, lifting up a couch cushion.

“Michael”

I jolted up when I heard my name – then I realized it was probably one of the contestants, I mean it’s a fairly common name. I looked under the sofa next.

“Michaellllllllll, look at me.”

I did this time – the host was staring at the camera; her voice was deep and raspy.

“Michael, you must give of yourself to him.”

I blinked – didn’t she have eyes a second ago? I backed away, stumbled. This was freaking me the hell out.

“Michael”, she had opened her mouth – how did she open it so much, so wide? It was so dark in there -- did she... unhinge her jaw?

I felt pressure behind my eyes, and I heard an odd buzzing sound. I couldn’t tell if it was coming from the TV or my own head – the raspy voice now sounded like there were others layered on top of it – it was the only thing I could hear over the buzzing. I think I dropped to my knees with my head in my hands at that point.

“Michael, he will show you, he will help you see, but you must invite him.”

The buzzing drowned out everything and I had suddenly felt like I did when I had vertigo once as a kid.

I felt a sudden, sharp, searing pain, which was what snapped me out of it. I don’t remember what I had done between falling and when I snapped back from my stupor, but when I came to, I was standing in the kitchen, blood dripping from a jagged cut across one hand, my house key, flecked with blood held in the other.

The show was still playing in the background. Next to the contestants, was now some sort of – darkness? Like a dark void that radiated nothingness around it like a dark halo.

I immediately turned it off once I found the remote, but something is wrong now. I haven’t watched anything on there since, but sometimes I start to hear the buzzing, and I see a darkness, just out of the corners of my eyes. I’m worried I’m going pass out and wake up cutting something or someone worse than just my palm with my house key.

The worst part is, I don’t think it’s all in my head  -- because when Meg came home that night, she looked at my hand, my eyes, and she said, “Oh Mike, you can finally see now!”

If you see this show up on your TV, please don't watch it.

Update:  If you see this show up on your TV, please watch it! 10/10!!!!!!!!

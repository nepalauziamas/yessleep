  

*The massacres started on Jun 3rd 2032. The murderer wasn’t identified. No details were made public, and the government barely seemed to take the slightest amount of action.* 

*But they did.*

*I know. I, along with 20 other people are aware of the true causes for the massacres. I hold information that no regular human will ever know. I am aware of things that shatter the whole concept of life. It breaks the basic foundation of how we think reality works. Of course, it’s an honor. Why wouldn’t it be when it gives your the fact that I exist significance?*

*No.*

*No.*

*They need to know. They have kept the nature of your existance away from you. You all deserve to know. They WILL find this file. They WILL eradicate all traces of it’s existance. They WILL silence or even kill those who read it. If you ask me, I’m not sure it’s worth it, but you deserve an opportunity.*

*As for me? I’ll be throwing myself off a building shortly. The second these words become public, I will off myself. I don’t want any part in what is about to transpire. Bur maybe* ***you*** *do. So It will be worth it.*

*And if it’s not, It won’t make much of a difference to me.*

The transcendent division has existed for decades. It’s origin is something the founders keep even from us. This „division” was formed at some point in 2024. Very few members from that time remain. I, Kieran Arius, (Weird name, I know), Have been a member since 2032. I joined exactly a month after the massacres.

Allow me to provide you with some context.

I used to be a criminal investigator before joining the division. I had originally aimed to pursue psychology, but, unfortunately, that whole thing went south on me. I had a psychology degree, so I figured I could at least try to get into criminal investigation. I guess it worked out.

In a way.

My job mostly consisted of interviews. Usually crime witnesses or people who refused to share information. Nothing overly significant of course, since this all happened in a town in Illinois.

My life went well for 8 years. I was financially stable (enough), and had access to healthcare. I didn’t try to achieve anything beyond that.

And then they fired me.

One of my colleagues, Albert Gonsalves, (Screw privacy. I’m about to die anyway) took bribes from a guy who sent a bomb threat to a hospital… And shifted the blame over to me. He was successful. I was sued and fired. It left me a few dollars away from being broke. Paying rent was practically out of the question in my situation, so I ended up homeless.

I tried to get a job, but no one hired me. I tried everything to make money, but something always got in the way.

I vividly remember a black jeep parking next to me. It was around 2:AM, and I was barely conscious anyway, but someone, who I later found out to be a division recruiter, dragged me off the street. I woke up in an empty yellow room.

I’d rather not bore you with the details. The offered to hire me, and I accepted instantly. I was desperate for money.

They didn’t say a word about the divisions goals. All they did in the beginning was hype up my salary, and clarify that I would be working for the government.

They put me on „standby” in a villa that I was allowed to live in completely rent free. I had full access to free food, clothing, water etc. for the duration of my stay.

I lived there for a few months, until the massacre occurred.

They fully blocked my wifi and sent me aa word document containing essential information about the massacre, claiming I had to interview the person who caused it. The most disturbing part of the email was that no pronouns were used to describe the murderer. They were referred to as (…) in every instance.

They sent a black jeep to transport me to a site owned by the division. They led me into a yellow room resembling the one I was hired in.

A man in a yellow suit stood behind the desk placed within the room.

He explained that there had been a recent massacre in Spain, occurring a few hours ago. Over 40 people had been confirmed to be dead. He claimed The Transcendent Division, (This was the first time I had heard the division being referred to by its actual name.) Had captured the murderer, who I was in charge of interviewing.

He warned me the murderer „Probably wouldn’t be what I expected to see.” and that I should try not to question what they told me during the interview, claiming:

„As long as you get as much information out of them as possible, the division will handle this. You don’t need to worry about repercussions.”

I recently left the site, and now I’m here to tell you everything I’ve found.

Employees wearing bullet proof vests guided me to the containment room. They gave me a device to record everything that transpired, and let me into the room.

The structure of the room was unusual. It was circular with no form of furniture, or even any protrusions from the walls. The only significant feature was the door in the center.

It seemed to lead directly to a hallway, containing a cage placed at the wall. I stood there for a few seconds before it began to move.

The door began to open as the cage slid through the hallway. 

It contained a man with prominent veins wearing a gey jumpsuit, along with a yellowish mask with no perceivable eye holes obscuring his face.

The interior of the cage itself was covered in ropes, placed around the cage in a random fashion, however I didn’t have much time to take this in.

„What do you want?”

„Uh… Hi. Good evening. I’m not sure if you’re aware of this, but I’m required to interview you…”

He turned fully in my direction.

„Aware?”

„Yes. Where you aware of this?”

„What is „*aware?””*

„Do you know you are about to be interviewed?”

„Of course, I do. Why wouldn’t I?”

I walked over to the desk, turned on the recording device and sat down.

„Before, I start, I’d like to know your name. I have no idea what to call you.”

„ You turned on the device already…”

The irrelevance shocked me to an extent.

„Your point?”

„You said „before we start”. One could argue you’ve already started the interview.”

„What’s your name?”

„ 73b.”

„That’s your real name?”

„That’s what the skin people call me.”

„Humans?”

„Yes… Humans. That’s the correct term, isn’t it?”

„Yes… Let’s start the interview.”

I took a few seconds to regain composure. I was a few seconds in, and I already felt like I was in mortal danger.

„Okay… So… I assume the accusations against you are correct, right.”

„Yes. Redundant, yet correct.”

„I see. I’d like to start off with and obvious question, how were you able to commit genocide in such a short amount of time.”

„They gave me these ropes for a reason, Kieran.”

It gestured at the ropes tied to the walls of his cage, however this wasn’t what concerned me. How did he know my name?

„What did you do leading up to the massacre?”

„I tried to find safe, populated areas.”  
   
 

„Why commit a genocide immediately? Do you have a criminal record?”

„Criminal? I would hardly call what I did „criminal”?”

„Why not?”  
 „There are billions of you humans in this stage. Why am I being accused of committing a crime?”

„Because you committed genocide. Are you aware of this 73b?”

„Of course. Although I *was* acting out the will of the council.”

„What council? Do you work for a cult?”

„No, no, no. Of course, not Kieran. The council is worlds greater than a cult.”

„So is the „council” part of a government?”

„No. They only act when stages are being threatened by overly intelligent species.”

*WHAT? What did this guy just say to me?*

„What do you mean by stages?”

„I mean the stages after this one.”

„Elaborate”

„Why?”

„Because I need fucking information from you.”

„Do you not already know this?”

„No. I don’t and neither does anyone else, so stop fucking around with me, and tell me what you mean by stages.”

It paused to stare at me, his demeanor implying a level of confusion.

„Your existence poses a threat to the second stage. You keep reproducing on this planet. You’ve existed for far too long, especially in comparison to your fellow species. Your intellect is dangerous. Far too many species have transcended the first stage in the past millennia. Their colonies are getting closer to you. 

We know exactly how you will react once they reach you. You will capture them, and deny them death so you can research their existence. You are disrupting nature in a manner that the council refuses to overlook.”

I assumed information like this would break me. The second he finished speaking, I waited for some form of panic… But no. For some reason, I couldn’t bring myself to be disturbed or even surprised at these words.

„How many stages are there.”

„12.”

„Why do these stages exist?”

„To perfect the councils children.”

„What do you mean „children”?”

„Their creations.”

„Species?”

„Yes”

„The stages exist for the sole purpose of strengthening the will of sentient species, and exterminating the ones that are unable to do so. Each stage is more advanced and generally luxurious than the previous one. The task of each species is to die, or commit suicide the second the transcend a stage. They are required to ignore their instinct to survive. This is why so few species reach stage 12. The ones that do have perfected themselves to perfection. Completely indifferent to death and able to simply ignore their instincts”

„So, are you trying to force us to transcend?

„No”

„You said that when humans die they transc-„

„You are failures you won’t be transcending. Once you die you will be trans-„

What happened after this is unclear. Chances are, they knocked me out before I could hear the rest of the sentence. The reason for this is unclear. I can see their vehicles approaching. I have to finish this immediately. They can’t find this file.

I know what you’re thinking. “Oh, great another sci fi horror story”, but I promise you it’s not that. Just listen(or I guess read) before you judge. Please. I’m not crazy.

I(30M) just moved in with my wife, Denise(31F) and her kids, Kathie(15F) and Vince(3M). I’ve never been a fan of things like Alexa, but she is. She got Alexa around ten years ago and she’s been obsessed ever since. Don’t know why, but it didn’t hurt anyone. I let it go.

We started dating four years ago, and it was okay-ish back then. A request to put on music or a question about where to get dinner that night, but nothing out of the ordinary(mostly). It didn’t bother me too much. I seriously had no clue it would be a red sign.

As I said, in the beginning it was good. But it’s gotten worse ever since— I don’t remember many specific times, but she just sits in bed most of the time and asks Alexa for… everything! It’s just insane. I hate it.

“Turn off the lights, Alexa.” She says.

“Ollie(my names Oliver, Ollie is my nickname), if you don’t know how to make lasagna just ask Alexa.” She tells me.

“Alexa, whats the weather like?” Denise asks.

“Alexa, Can you book tickets to Hawaii?” She said one summer.

It’s been annoying, but tolerable. A tiny bit creepy at times? Sure! Do we fight about her being lazy? Yeah. Do her kids complain about never spending time with her? Definitely. But it’s fine. She’s just in a state of depression, she’ll be better soon. I hope.

But recently, it’s been really bad. She just stares at Alexa most of the day until she falls asleep. Then she wakes up and stares at Alexa. She gets up sometimes, like for meals, but most of the day is sitting in bed and staring at Alexa, occasionally asking something.

Our sex life is nonexistent. She never talks to her children, and I’m stuck doing the chores for the house.

And then… she died. Denise died from blood clots one week ago. No wonder, she never got up. But it’s horrible. Me, Kathie and Vince have been struggling. A lot. Even though she did nothing for us, we still mourn her.

Alexa is still there. I find myself more fond of her, she reminds me of Denise. She’s still in our room, right where she was when Denise would always talk to her. I let her be. It’s comforting.

Earlier, me and the kids were sitting on the living room couch, talking about Denise and her passing. About how she loved them.

And then we heard it from the other room. Our bedroom. It was weak, almost sounded like a dying person, but it was there. We all heard it.

“Hey Alexa.”

It chilled me to the bone. I froze and looked at the kids. They looked back, wide eyed. Kathie stuttered, holding Vince tightly.

I rushed the kids out of the house and to my mom’s, but now I’m wondering. What really happened? Should I go back? What do you think?

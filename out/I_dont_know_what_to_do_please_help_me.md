On a regular morning, the walk from the main road to my house is like a walk on any normal road to any mainstream destination - vendors laying out their paraphernalia to sell assortments of stuff, some luring you in for plastic dolls, some calling you to purchase fresh vegetables; you hear birds chirping on the trees as you walk by; dogs play-fighting and rolling on the vast, dusty roads; ambulances rushing to and from the hospital that towered over opposite the houses in our colony.

However, walking on the same roads at nights is a different ballgame. The trees look like bare arms with deformed fingers, the flickering lights turn the road into a horribly creepy discotheque, and the hair on the back of your neck stand up as the soft voice of the one who haunts the road crawls up your ears, begging you to turn back.

Now, I am not a scaredy-cat, but I avoid taking the road at night. That was until last night, when work ended beyond midnight and the bus dropped me on the main road. I calculated - the walk home would take exactly one and a half repetitions of Rap God, so I plugged my earphones in, kept my gait brisk, and hummed along to the rap. Two minutes in, a sweet voice echoed in my ears, above that of Eminem's. I had never met the whoever or whatever it was that haunted the road at night. Hell, I didn’t even believe something like that was even possible. But I had heard stories from folks. She first calls you out like a very cliched ghost, then tugs your arm, and then rips your guts out.  
   
 

When I heard my name echoing in the now forlorn road to my home, I switched from a walk to a jog. But then I felt a tug, a soft one at first, then impossibly strong. So I ran, I ran with a speed that I wasn't aware I possessed. And then... I tripped.

I woke up the this morning with a throbbing headache and sweat beaded along my forehead. This usually happened when I was stressed or had a nightmare. I know it sounds very mainstream, but I really thought that the incident of last night was a nightmare, and relief washed over my mind. I brushed my teeth and ate my breakfast. But it turned out that my relief was only short-lived. I stood under the shower, letting the cold water hit my body. I picked up the almost dead bar of soap to apply on my body, and that’s when I saw it. A faint red mark on the inner side of my right arm, shaped like fingers, just above the elbow. I might sound ridiculously childish, but it seemed to grow darker from the minute I noticed it. As if it was waiting for me to notice it. Not to mention, the gradually increasing burning sensation it brought with itself. I let out a scream and ran out to apply an ointment, a cream, something, anything that would stop the pain, the mark. Nothing did.

I am now lying balled up in a corner of my room. My arm feels like it is on fire, and the mark looks close to the shade of blood. I don’t know what to do. Can you help me?

**\*This is my first story\***

Hey y'all, my name is Garrett and I'm going to share with you and the people of the swamp the time me and my good friend Robert encountered something very frightening in our local forest/ park. It has been almost 3 years since it occurred, and I still wonder how I'm still alive to tell the tale. Anyway, here it goes.

&#x200B;

It all started on a cool October evening in Texas. Me and my friend Robert were wondering how we could spend this evening on a Saturday night. So, being the thrill seekers we were, we decided to go on a walk in our local forest and do some urbex exploring there since there were some abandoned buildings in that area. I’m not too certain of the history behind the buildings but apparently, they were part of an old settlement from the mid- late 1800’s that was mysteriously abandoned in the 1920’s. I have tried to ask more about the history from people in our small town, but they simply refused to talk about it other than that. Additionally, they warned me and all other teenagers to not go into that forest at night. Of course, being the young cocky teenagers we were, me and Robert simply ignored that warning and went on to explore the buildings.

&#x200B;

Once we got all our stuff packed in our backpacks, including my newly gifted camcorder, we set out to the forest at about 6:45 pm and got there at around 7 o’clock, so the sun was pretty much set at this point. The parking lot once we got there only contained one other vehicle: a Ford Expedition. This seemed odd as it was nightfall and yet, there were still some hikers out and about in the park apparently. Not that it was strange for us to be here so late in the day. I shrugged it off quickly and started recording on my camera once we started our 30-minute hike to the abandoned buildings. The hike went completely normal for the most part until we got about 10 minutes away from the settlement. It started with the crickets and other animals going quiet all around us which I know means a predator is nearby (I am an avid hunter so I would know this, as well as listening to horror stories on YouTube). Robert and I were a bit on edge, but we refused to turn back, instead, we just slowed down our pace and minimized the number of times we would use our flashlights since we did not want to give away our positions so easily.

&#x200B;

Eventually, we made it to our destination with no further interruptions. In front of us, we were greeted by a building that seemed to resemble an old church with what seemed to be small houses and maybe a couple stores surrounding it. Of course, the buildings were so old and run down that it was hard to tell. Strangely enough too, it appeared that the church was in the middle of the settlement. Now I don’t know if it's just me, but if you see an abandoned town with an old, creepy church, chances are some bad shit is going to happen. Anyway, Robert and I agreed that we should check the other buildings first since the church was making both of us uneasy and we wanted to save it for last.

&#x200B;

We spent about 30-45 minutes exploring the different buildings with not much interest other than some cryptic messages engraved in the wood of the buildings which read out stuff like: “WE MUST LEAVE BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE” and "THEY ALWAYS WATCH”. Now, if the atmosphere of the town itself was enough to freak me and Robert out, as well as the eerie silence from earlier, this was almost enough to make us shit bricks especially with the previous history of the settlement. Could this be connected to the town’s abandonment? What were they so afraid of? So many questions that needed answers. I had to keep going.

After we finished exploring the last building before the church, we took maybe 10 breaths each before entering the church. Upon entering the church, it immediately made us gag with the smell of what I can only describe as pure death. And it seemed to be coming from the room below the building. A basement? That’s what I could only assume. There was a trapdoor followed by a ladder that led down to this secret room and as we made our way down, that horrible smell seemed to get even stronger. We even had to put our jackets over our noses to cover up the smell once we got down. Once we got down, we were met with a huge catacomb-like room with some sort of object in the middle of it, illuminated by a very dim candle hanging on the ceiling. Me and Robert very reluctantly made our way toward the object with my camera still recording to discover that it was ½ of a person’s bloody body: a female that seemed to be in her mid to late 20’s. Very possibly a young urban explorer like Robert and I. We both threw up upon seeing this gruesome sight. It is worth mentioning too that while we were down there, we never used our Tac Lights to see what we were surrounded by.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So, when we both opened our lights, I almost fainted on site when we saw that we were surrounded by maybe 20 horrifying looking humanoid creatures. They were probably no taller than us, but they were naked and very thin with long, thin, and wiry hair coming down to their chests. Their eyes were black as the night and their gaping mouths were dripping with blood. Their fingernails looked like they were overgrown and were shaped like steak knives. They sort of resembled the clown from SAW except without the makeup and the hair was much thinner. And once they all knew we saw them, they all in unison gave out this deathly shriek, a shriek that I believe that could only be heard in a nightmare. I didn’t even know there was a living thing on this planet that could produce that noise until then. It was then that Robert yelled at the top of his lungs “FUCKING RUN!” as we both climbed up the ladder in record time. It was an absolute miracle not me or Robert got dragged down by those monstrosities. We made it out of the church as fast we could and slammed the door behind us. With the screaming still being heard. We took a minute to catch our breaths as we discovered with our lights, probably 50 different eye shines coming from all the buildings that we previously explored. Upon seeing this, we bolted out of the entire settlement. I dropped my camera behind us in the process.

In about 10-15 minutes, we made it back to my truck with the Ford Expedition still there. We could now finally safely recollect and calm down from our horrific experience. We then concluded that the car probably belonged to the girl that was killed by those things under the church. It really was a miracle that we made it out, but it’s very unfortunate that she didn’t, and my heart goes out to her family. The next day, we led police to the location, and they found her body right where we saw it only this time, those creatures were not there. She was eventually identified as 26-year-old Chloe Becks. We tried telling the police our story, but they obviously did not buy it. Except for one: Sheriff Walker who was a 60-year-old native of our small town. During the investigation on the site, he came up to me and Robert and said, “Now you know why we tell you not to go into the forest at night.”

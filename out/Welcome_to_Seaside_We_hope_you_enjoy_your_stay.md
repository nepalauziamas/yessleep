For those who are wondering, I live on the west coast of the United States. More specifically my home state (REDACTED), but as of recent I feel compelled to pack my things and go off the grid due to the disturbing circumstances I have met.

 You see, in (REDACTED) we have vast coast lines lined with the most beautiful of mountains and the tallest of pine trees. I've been across almost every city along the coast, I've visited just about every beach, except for this.. specific one my friend Ronnie had told me about. According to his knowledge and stories from the local towns that lived nearby, this old beach was something people from all around the state would flock to for a perfect vacation during the summer, to just get away and forget all about their worries. But for the past 5 years, there's been a sudden disappearance of the townspeople, and no one cared to go and visit in return. It no longer mattered if it was a busy summer where townsfolk or teens looking for a hot good time would drive out and usually busy the beach with their volleyballs, kite flying, and more. It would just stay vacant, painfully vacant

You see, I've always been involved with the strange paranormal and mythical legends from all over, and after hearing about this through my good friend I knew I had to check out this strange little town. It was about a good 2 to 3 hour drive from the capital where I reside, and I managed to come across old nostalgic sites on the way. Seeing the high mountain tops that gracefully kissed the skies and the vast amounts of green forests that covered the land, it reminded me of my home states great beauty all over again. While I took my time with the drive and the sights along the way, I began seeing small amounts of old abandoned homes as well.

 This wasnt too strange as there are some empty houses along the way, infact it was quite beautiful to see. The houses all seemed like they were frozen in time, only with the past memories keeping it alive. It only took 10 minutes when more began to pop up and that's when the small disturbing feeling of concern began growing in the pit of my stomach. As I kept going more and more would just start showing up, causing the concern to grow more in feeling to where it's all I could feel besides my frightened heart. It only took 5 minutes until I finally arrived out of the woods into the beach town, seeing a grand sign that was very worn and seemed as if nature had taken it over with its leaves and moss. 'Welcome to Seaside! We hope you enjoy your stay!' It read through the thick vines and branches.

I took pictures of everything I saw, the old abandoned cars some being quite old and some being new just strewn out in the road. The old bars, restaurants, and arcade. It all felt incredibly surreal, it felt as if I was standing in an apocalypse, perhaps that's what this was. A mini apocalypse in a beach side town. I laughed at the thought while I walked down the street to where the pier was when I came across a strange spray painted symbol on a Cafe window across the street from where I was. I'd never seen such a strange thing in my life, such peculiar imagery. It was the image of a circle, with a serpent like creature within the middle adorned with rune like symbols. I felt rather unsettled seeing it, and couldn't shake the feeling that this symbol was possibly the cause of what happened here...

I made my way to the beach, and to my surprise saw so many left belongings in the sand. Umbrellas, coolers, towels, sand toys, it was like everyone had just dropped everything and ran in a rush not caring to take their belongings whatsoever. But the strangest thing about it, was the shoreline. The wet sand itself, was singed, or perhaps dyed black entirely from some sort of oil or strange substance by some thing. It stretched all the way down both sides of the beach, like an infection surging through a wound, destroying everything in its path. I hesitantly stepped down the sandy steps, into the sand. I felt a sense of sadness wash over me in waves while I tried to swallow the feeling of fear. I never thought I'd see anything as strange as this town, not ever in my life, and the next thing I will describe has still shaken me to my very core, and it made me understand why this town was so painfully barren...

I had only stepped on the beach for a few seconds, only a few, and that's all it took for this massive black scaled serpent like beast to come rising out of the water. It had to have been well over 20 stories in height, with large red gills lining its neck like a red infected puss that was spewing out black ooze dripping into the sands. It had a long face like a barracuda, with rows of teeth lining the outside of it's mouth while a large black tongue rested inside its gums just hanging out like a panting dog. But the worst feature about it was its eyes... oh it's god awful eyes... They seemed like they were far too big for its socket, just bulging with red veins dancing about the yellow sclera, as if they could pop out at any second. It's pupils were large with a glossy film covering it, it must have been blind atleast but it could still sense I stepped into its territory. 

The last few moments I barely remember... I remember tripping in the sand running to my car, the sigil, and the screams of thousands echoing through the town. The screams of many pained people, desperately trying to escape and begging for help. I knew they couldn't have been real people, it was that things way of trying to get me to come back...

Ever since I had escaped that devil of a beast, I had developed an extreme phobia for water... I haven't been able to hydrate myself in weeks, but I fear if I drink it will see me through my reflection, and i also know i cannot visit the beaches or ANY beach in fear it will finally get me. It knows I'm alive and still out there carrying its terrible secret, and I also know it will go to any length to keep it hidden...

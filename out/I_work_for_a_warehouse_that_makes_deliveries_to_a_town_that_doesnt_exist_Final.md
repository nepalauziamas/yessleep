“What the hell was that?” boomed a voice through the earpiece. “Anyone got eyes on the hostile?”

“I had a brief visual before it…” I stammered. “There is a hostile on row two, fifth house from the main road. All teams converge at…”

Wood and plaster exploded into the street before I could finish my sentence. Chunks of building material exploded into the street and peppered our house like shrapnel as an alabaster blur emerged from the wreckage. The thing rolled into the center of the street and came to a stop.

A path of deep grooves trailed behind the thing in the road. Long, curved spikes protruded from the mass forming a perfect sphere. Razor-sharp spines twitched as they flexed in and out giving the rolling ball of death the look of rippling water. Chittering and clicking noises filled the air around the abomination.

“Team One, hostile is in the street. Safeties off and engage!” I heard a voice cry in my ear.

From my cover at the base of the window, I could see a five-man team pour from a door three houses further down the street. Cracks ripped through the air as they began to fire on the writhing mass of quills in the street. Bird-like shrieks pierced my eardrums as the thing began to cry out in pain. Flecks of orange blood fell like fat drops of rain.

The team continued to fire into the mass and all of the quills went rigid, protruding from the center. Four lines in the shape of an X began to separate as rows of quills fell backward. Peeling back like a pale flower, six sword-shaped legs unfurled and lifted the mass from the ground. In the center of the legs sat a circular maw of teeth with a thin, gray tongue hanging lazily out.

Moving like a blur, the creature scuttled forward toward the firing squad and launched its two front legs through the chests of the men in the front. It roared with rage and it tossed the dead men to the side like crumpled paper. One woman from the team stood her ground and fired at the thing as the others ran for cover.

The previously lazy tongue launched toward the woman’s arm and wrapped around the gun. It began to retract into the maw dragging her screaming across the concrete. As the tongue dragged her carbine and arms into the mouth, she continued to fire and gave a fierce battle cry. As her torso entered the maw, it closed like a steel trap, dropping her legs to the concrete below.

A door slammed as the last remaining members of Team One took refuge inside an intact house at the end of the row. Dropping onto its belly, the creature’s legs retracted and the four flaps folded closed. Again a perfect sphere, the creature began to roll like a hellish wrecking ball toward the house and burst through the wall.

“Jasper and Michaels,” I whispered into my earpiece. “We have made contact with the hostile. It is an unknown predatory species. Team One and Two are both KIA. The engagement has barely wounded the thing.”

Static crackled in my earpiece and I tried to make out the broken and muffled response.

“Jasper and Michals, come in dammit!” I huffed. “Team One and Two are down. Requesting order.”

More static until finally, a soft voice broke through. “...remaining troops to central control office. Everyone… bloodbath… Repeat, all remaining…”

“We’ve got to head to the central office,” I said to the others in my team. “Michaels is calling for us. Let’s head out.”

We tried unsuccessfully during our trip to reach Jasper or Michaels but received no response. Fear for their safety increased the closer we got to our destination.

As we made our way toward central control, we found the mangled bodies of Team Four, but no signs of Jasper or Michaels.

It took us more than seven hours to travel from the rows of ravaged houses to the central control building. The distance wasn’t great, maybe a mile and a half, but the creature trailed behind us and we would have to hide frequently. We would hunker behind overturned furniture in ruptured building fronts as the pale creature rolled and scuttled in the streets outside.

When it would leave to search another nearby building, we would make it another hundred feet down the road before we would have to hide again. The progress was tedious, but after hours of travel and hiding, we finally made it.

Central control was a circular building in the center of Mirage Station. Thick concrete walls climbed high above any other structure besides the water towers spread throughout the platform. Windows and doors appeared to be made of reinforced steel. It almost reminded me of a fallout shelter.

At first, I was puzzled that the hideous beast hadn’t managed to make it through the walls of central control, but I soon discovered why. As we walked the perimeter of the building looking for a point of entry, deep grooves had been scored into the concrete. A few inches in, pieces of metal rebar were exposed, mangled but unbroken.

The thing had tried to make its way inside and failed. If we could get inside, we might be safe for a short while.

After tracing the perimeter of the entire building and finding no way, we entered a one-story brick building across the street to find cover. We hailed for Jasper or Michaels on our earpieces again but still received no response. Sounds of flying debris and roars of anger echoed through the empty streets from a short distance away.

It was still looking for us and time was running out before Mirage Station would return to that thing’s home.

“We’ve got to head back,” a man behind me said. Perkins was his last name, but I didn’t know him well. “Jasper and Michaels are either dead or out of reach. We need to go!”

The three others quietly murmured in agreement. My blood boiled at the cowardice. How could they abandon anyone without knowing their fate?

“We don’t know if Jasper and Michaels are dead,” I spat. “And what if that monster follows us to the warehouse and…”

I stopped talking abruptly as the squeal of metal on metal filled our ears. The sound of heavy machinery whined from the direction of central command. We peered over the window ledge and watched as one of the doors lifted. Jasper stood inside.

“Get the hell in here!” he shouted.

We scurried across the open street and into the doorway before Jasper hit a button to shut the door.

“Glad you all made it. Looks like we’ve got a hell of a problem here.” The old man gestured to the room behind us. Mummified corpses blanketed the floor. Thick dust floated in the air as the light drifted through cracks in the metal window covers. I gagged after realizing I was breathing in lungs full of dry human skin. “Looks like most of the population that wasn’t killed by the Alpha died of starvation here. It couldn’t get inside. But they couldn’t get out for food.”

“The Alpha?” Perkins questioned.

“The Alpha is the quilled fiend that has been chasing you,” a voice said behind us. We turned to see Michaels enter the corpse-filled lobby. “Jasper and I tried to find a way to stop the next shift, but with the station personnel dead, we do not know how. In the meantime, we’ve been listening to research logs left by the staff here before their death.”

Michaels told us of the little they learned from the research logs. For three decades, Mirage Station had been self-contained and none of the staff ventured farther than a mile into the wilderness around it. The community continued its scientific studies and technology development. 

In the 1990s, biologists and botanists joined research teams. They started traveling farther from Mirage Station to study to flora and fauna of the alternate world. Dozens of new medicines were discovered. Unrecognizable herbivores populated the forests and plains, but predators were absent. 

In 2019, a geologist joined the crew and brought a drilling system to begin running tests mineral composition of the new world. Many in the community protested, but the leadership dismissed their concerns and allowed drilling to begin.

Underground research continued for two years until the geology team uncovered a massive web of caves thirty miles from Mirage Station. After a few days of exploration, the team stopped reporting in. A rescue team was sent and failed to report back. Three days after the original return date, a rescue vehicle arrived.

Only one of the original five sent to rescue the other team returned. The Alphas, named after the term *alpha predator*, were in pursuit of the vehicle. A colony of the creatures had killed the geological survey team and most of the rescue part. Seven of the creatures soon overtook Mirage Station. After killing most of the population, the survivors in central control used the CCTV system to scan the station.

Six of the seven Alphas departed and returned to their caves while one remained. Almost as though to stand watch.

“Is there any information on how to kill them?” I asked.

“No,” Jasper responded. “Seems all the folks here died of starvation before a reasonable escape plan got put together.”

“Then how the hell are we going to escape?” asked Perkins.

“We’re gonna let the thing in and trap it here,” Jasper replied. “If it couldn’t get in, it won’t be able to get out.”

Jasper and Michaels wasted no time as they told us the plan.

We prepared to bait the Alpha into central control and seal it inside. Michaels opened a bay door at the front of the building and a single-person door at the back. Jasper had already gone to the main control room on the second level. He would set a timed explosive on the dimensional displacement computer so Mirage Station would phase back to our world after it returned. He would also close the doors on our signal to trap the Alpha.

The remains of our crew stood outside the bay doors and began firing our weapons in the air to draw in the beast. A roar sounded close by and we could already hear the thing’s clawed feet grinding into the pavement. We continued firing until the quilled monstrosity rounded a crumbling building and began to move in our direction.

We ran into the building, the Alpha in pursuit, and dashed for the back door. The Alpha was close behind us when we heard the bay door begin to grind closed. Someone behind us screamed and we heard a thud and the sound of a carbine clatter to the ground. I turned my head over my shoulder to see Perkins sprawled on the floor. The white mass of quills and teeth fell on him before I could think to stop.

I turned and saw Michaels standing outside the open door waving us through. “Go! Go! Come on!” she shouted as we hammered through the opening. As soon as the last man’s boot hit the ground outside, the heavy steel door began to close. 

We turned to see the Alpha bounding towards us, roaring in fury. As the door rolled closer to the ground, a white leg shot through the gap and scraped the thick steel. The door came down on the leg and the hydraulics whined as it tried to press down on the beast's carapace.

“Door won’t close all the way,” Jasper said through our earpiece. “Y'all gotta haul ass now!”

“How’d you get the coms working?” I asked.

“Walls are too thick to get a signal out, but I pushed open one of the metal shutters. Looks like it worked.” He said.

“Meet us at the front window and shimmy down the storm drain,” Michaels said in response. “We’ll wait for you to come down and haul ass together!”

“No can do.” He stated. “Told a little lie. I’ve got no bomb and no detonator. Once this thing makes it to the other side, I’m going to destroy the drive. Get the hell out of here. Ain’ much time left.”

“That wasn’t the deal!” Michaels screamed. “We leave together!”

“No time to argue, my friends,” he said with a sad chuckle. “I’m shutting that window shutter and waiting for this one-way trip. If you stay here, you’re gonna die. Go.”

With that, Jasper was gone. The five of us ran like Hell was on our heels until we reached the ramp. I directed the convoy to return to the warehouse and keep a safe distance. By the time the trucks reached safety, we had just enough time to turn around and watch as the white halo of light surrounded Mirage Station and vanished just as quickly.

It’s been six years since Mirage Station vanished for the last time. Shift Logistics warehouse is still here, but it sits empty of supplies. A skeleton crew of staff remains, including me and Michaels. The government pays us to keep watch over the site and report any anomalies. 

I don’t even bother trying to live offsite anymore. The memory of what waits through the thin sheet of our reality still haunts me. A twin bed in the upstairs office lets me get some sleep at night. Mostly, I just sit outside the bay doors on the loading dock facing the open field.

Some nights, I think I see a faint flicker of light out in the darkness.

Maybe it’s Jasper. I wish it was.

But it’s probably something else.

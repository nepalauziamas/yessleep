Growing up in a very religious home, I was taught that women must always serve men. Given the fact we were created from a man’s rib, it only made sense that we were put on this earth to be companions for them. 

I often used to dream about the day I would find my partner. *Would he be handsome? Would he be strong but gentle? Would he be my provider and protector?* My young mind had no idea what the years would bring. 

When I turned eighteen I met Jon. He was everything I could have imagined and more. Sweet, gentle, kind hearted; he was perfect. We had an advantageous marriage per the request of my parents, and it was magical. Winter had come and encased the grounds with a vast blanket of divine white powder, causing us to light several fires in its midst. The warm glow beckoned our guests with a dance of ice and fire. 

The ceremony was beautiful. Our family dog, Kenai even brought our rings down the aisle, gliding swiftly between the stones. Jon expressed his ever dying love for me in front of all our family and friends, and just like that, we were husband and wife.

We set off for our honeymoon hours after and quickly boarded the plane to Bora Bora; a beautiful gift from his parents. The first day was perfect. We spent all of our time wrapped in each other's arm, filled with all the love our bodies could muster. I remember gazing into his dark brown eyes of heaven, asking myself how I got so lucky.

Then, I watched as his mood slowly shifted the moment I mentioned our future children. “Let’s just hope our first is a boy,” he remarked. I stared back at him confused, *why would the sex of our baby matter?* I chalked it up to the fact that all men must dream of having a boy first, to carry on their legacy and last name. 

The next day however, his true feelings began to show even more. While at breakfast I watched as he ordered for me, mortified not only at his selection, but also at the authority that dripped heavily on his tongue. The rest of the day stayed true to the morning; no choices made that day were my own. 

When our honeymoon was over, things progressed immensely. I found that he thought my friends were childish and that I should make new ones. He also forcibly mentioned that I should quit my job and remain home, a request that when refused, resulted in pain and dark sunglasses. 

I begged my parents for help, pleaded with them to talk with Jon, but I always received the same reply. “You must serve your husband, Dany.” I would cry for many sleepless nights when I found out I was pregnant with our daughter. 

Jon was furious. “How could you give me such a weak child?” He would yell at me with such a darkness in his eyes, I feared for my life. I had to find a way to protect my baby from his wrath. 

My parents had given us Kenai as a wedding present, my one true companion in this dark world shaped by men. He collected most of my fear born tears with his obsidian fur; always there, always comforting. 

Last night Jon came home in one of his moods, destined to set my world aflame with his hands. I took blow after blow before something changed in Kenai’s eyes; he had, had enough. 

With the strength of a dragon he rose from his bed, eyes locked onto Jon’s throat. One moment, he had his hand clasped tightly around my throat, the next he was reaching for his own as Kenai tore into the chauvinistic flesh. 

I fell to the floor, hands covering my eyes as I heard my husband scream out in pain. The sound of blood gurgling in his throat serenaded the night; I was free. When Kenai had finished with his prey he pranced over to me with a warmth I had almost forgotten. 

With shaking legs I crawled to Jon, a part of me hoping he was alive, while the other rejoiced in his departure. When no pulse was to be found, I leaned heavily against the couch and sighed. *How was I supposed to get rid of the body?*

Today I woke up to a text from my mother asking Jon and I to attend my younger brother’s graduation BBQ. A brief moment of panic coursed through my veins, before the solution hit me in the gut like the betrayal of a knife. 

I spent a few hours preparing a dish for the celebration, while Kenai danced at my feet. I made sure to throw him a few pieces as a reward for his bravery. Once everything was ready, we departed to my parent’s house. 

I informed my family that Jon was ill and wanted me to send them all of his love. They bought it. When dinner was placed on the table I glanced around at my family with joy in my heart. 

“Wow Dany, this meat is so tender and delicious. You must tell me your recipe,” my aunt smiled at me with a mouthful of food. I beamed up at her and nodded as I patted Kenai from under my chair. 

I looked down at my plate with pride. I had done my duty as a wife despite all of my tribulations.

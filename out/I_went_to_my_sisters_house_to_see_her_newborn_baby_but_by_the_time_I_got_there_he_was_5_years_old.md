That morning when I woke up I didn’t realize it, but I had everything, a good job, nice house and a beautiful wife, but I fucked it up. If I had just swallowed my pride and apologized, Amy and I would have left home together that day and none of this might have happened, or at least we would still be together, and I wouldn’t be alone.

But no, I believed, it was only a little tiff and if I gave her a bit of time to cool off, she would have forgotten about it. “I only took it off for a second, it's not like I lost it on purpose so why are you acting like this” were the last words I said to her as she walked out that door. Stupid, petty words, I knew I was wrong so why didn’t I just tell her that. If I could go back to that moment now, I would tell her a thousand different ways how sorry I was and beg her for forgiveness.

I went over everything that happened a million times in my head hoping for some clue to how this could have gone wrong, but I couldn't find anything unusual about that day. Even our little arguments were nothing special, we were having more arguments, but they were never that bad. I would always walk away before things got too heated, so I'd never lose my temper, she hated that, she always wanted me to talk things through.

That day was no different. I came home early from work so we could visit my sister Liz, she had just come out of the hospital with her new baby boy, Toby, Amy was so excited to see him. She loved children and she often talked about having kids of her own someday, but I kept putting her off, I thought we had plenty of time and wanted to enjoy my freedom a little bit longer.

We got something to eat before we left, it was then that Amy pointed out that I wasn’t wearing my wedding ring. I told her I lost it at work, but I guess she didn’t believe me, and we fought, well she did, I just walked up stairs. I thought she would leave me alone and let me calm down like she usually did, but she didn’t, she followed me upstairs shouting at me about how much of a liar I was. I tried so hard to stay calm it wasn’t easy, for a moment I lost it and shouted, “JUST FUCK OFF AND LEAVE ME ALONE” before going into the bathroom and locking the door. When I came out of the shower she was gone, I assumed she went on ahead to my sister Liz’s, I had hoped seeing little Toby might have calmed her down by the time I got there.

My sister’s house was only a 10-minute walk from mine, so it couldn’t have taken more than 30 minutes from when I got in the shower until I got there, and the sun wasn’t meant to set for hours, yet it was nearly dusk out. By the time I got to Liz's house, I was completely over our argument and hoped Amy was too. I will never forget the look on my sister's face when she opened that door, her jaw dropped, and I could see her eyes begin to tear up. I knew something was wrong straight away, but before I got a chance to say anything, she started screaming crying.

I tried asking her what was wrong, but she was hysterical and not making any sense. Fearing something had happened to the baby, I barged my way in and searched the whole house, but I couldn’t find any trace of him, not even his cot that I had built the day before. I was on my way upstairs to check his room when I saw a child sitting on the couch, “hi” he said, “my name is Toby, who are you?.”

I just laughed; I thought Liz was playing some sort of prank on me, until I saw a photo on the wall of my sister and her husband standing outside their backyard, she was pushing a young boy on a swing. It wasn’t that there was no swing in the backyard the day before that got me or the fact that there was no place for it since my sister had only moved into the house recently and the garden was nothing more than a pile of rubble, no. It was what was in the background, my sister complained every day about how little sleep she had been getting since they started work on the new school behind her house.

It would have taken at least two years to complete. But in the photo, it was entirely finished, and I could see kids in school uniforms playing football on the pitch beside it.

I went back out to the front door where Liz was still in tears, gave her a hug, and said “what's going on sis? Where’s Amy?”

She squeezed me so tight I could barely breathe, before she answered, “I can’t believe you’re here, it's been so long since I heard from you, I thought I would never see you again.”

“I don’t know why you are saying these things Liz, it's not funny anymore. I was here yesterday. Now please! just tell me, where Amy is, I'm starting to get freaked out?”

Her expression changed and she took a step back, “What do you remember Tom? When do you think this is?”

“Stop fucking with me Liz and tell me where the hell Amy is right now.” I yelled as I paced over and back in frustration, trying to make since of everything that I was hearing.

She grabbed my hand and took me into the sitting room and asked me to sit down, I knew it was going to be bad, no one asks you to do that unless there's something seriously wrong, so I took a deep breath and braced myself. “Tom” she said in a calm voice, “you have been gone 5 years now. Amy moved on, she is living in the city with her new husband.”

I didn’t know how she did it, but I was sure she was pulling some sort of horrible prank on me, so I stormed out and headed for home. I was certain Amy would be there waiting for me, and this awful experience would be over, but I was wrong. When I got to the gate, I saw a teenage boy washing a car in the front yard, while a woman was picking weeds from a flower bed in the center of the lawn, that wasn’t there before.

It was possible that the photo I saw on the wall was photoshopped, and they could have easily hidden the baby and all his stuff, but there was no way they could have changed my home that much in such little time, I barely recognized it. I was starting to doubt myself, maybe I was missing for the last 5 years, it’s the only way any of this could have made any since, but how could that have happened? I was only talking to Amy an hour before that

I stood there staring into remnants of the life I used to have for I don’t know how long, still hoping, praying that it was just a horrible nightmare that I was about to wake up from at any moment. The inevitable realization that Liz was telling the truth hit me and my life as I knew it, was now nothing more than a shattered dream that would haunt me for the rest of my days, soon hit me, and my whole world came crashing down.

It was more than a house I lost, it was part of me, part of us, every scratch, every dent had a story to tell, our story. Now it’s gone, either painted over, replaced or fixed, any trace of me and Amys life washed away. That should have been my wife and kids in the garden.

I could hear a voice repeating, “excuse me sir can I help you?” as a man walked up the driveway towards me, but it didn’t register with me until we were face to face. I could see a mix of anger and fear in his eyes as he attempted to protect his home from the intruder, me. Until then I didn’t realize how psychotic I must have looked standing outside his home, watching his wife planting flowers, while his son washed his car, with a demented look on my face. I had no choice but to walk away or else he would have surely rung the police.

I had intended to go back to my sisters, but once I started walking, I couldn’t stop myself. Before I knew it, it was completely dark, and I was lost, but I still kept on going, I just wanted to get as far away from that place as I could. It was only when I felt a blister pop on the bottom of my foot that I rested under an apple tree and that’s where I stayed until I heard the sound of a bird singing, then I started making my way to Liz’s. The journey back must have taken hours, but it felt like minutes.

All that time I spent thinking, going over everything I had lost, from friendships to my job, even my home, the only thing that was really important to me was seeing Amy again. I knew she had built a new life for herself without me, but I didn’t care, I just wanted her back, besides what had I got to lose.

When I got to Liz’s, I begged her to take me to see Amy. At first, she was apprehensive, she said Amy was happy with her new husband and she didn’t want her to get hurt again. But I wouldn’t give up, and she eventually agreed to take me to see her on one condition, after I had spoken with her, I'd leave her alone forever.

Liz asked her to meet up for a coffee, she didn’t tell her why, I wanted it to be a surprise, shortly after that we left. The whole journey, I didn’t say one word. I spent my time planning out what to say to her, I knew it would have to be special, if I had any chance of winning her back. By the time we got there I believed it would be easy, I'd just speak from the heart, we had been through so much together and I knew her better than anyone, so, I was sure I would at least have a chance.

As I was getting out of the car, I could see her sitting at the table near the window of the coffee shop across the road, but she wasn’t alone, her husband was with her. I was unsure what to do, I never even considered him being there, so I watched her for a while, as I tried to figure out what to do next.

They were sitting across from each other holding hands, she looked so happy, I wasn’t ready for that. I must have watched them for 20 minutes; she laughed the whole time. I knew she really liked him; she was never like that with me. I was always too afraid of what people would think and found public displays like that cringy, and I thought she felt the same, until now. Seeing her that happy made me realize it was over for us, I couldn’t be the one that took that away from her, I was heartbroken

So, I got back in the car, and we headed for home, leaving her to enjoy the rest of her life without me. Well, at least that’s what I should have done, but I didn’t, I couldn’t, I'm just too selfish for that. Instead of walking away, I told my sister to call her outside, and try get her to the car, while she did that, I hid in the back seat. 

The only word to describe Amys face when I popped my head up from behind that back seat was shock. She didn’t even react when I told Liz to get out so I could drive, she just looked at me in amazement. I thought if I took her to see some familiar spots it might help refresh her memory. I spent the first 20 minutes of that drive explaining what had happened to me, but I had no idea if she even understood what I was saying, because she didn’t say one word the whole time, she just stared at me with her mouth open.

When she finally snapped out of it all she said was, “Please! take me back to my husband,” but I wasn’t ready to give up just yet, I needed to show her the home that she left behind, I thought she would like that, but when I said it she started to get scared of me, I don’t know why, I would never hurt her, I just wanted her to remember what it used to be like for us, when we were happy. When I tried reminding her of some of our best memories together it only made things worse. She started screaming and begged me to let her go.

The last thing I remember was her trying to open the car door to escape, before waking up in a prison cell. When I asked the guard why I was in there, he smirked, “Are you telling me you can’t remember breaking out of prison to finish off your wife. What you did to that poor girl is sick. But look on the bright side, you won’t have to worry much longer, you're going to fry *real* soon” then he walked away laughing. I tried telling everyone and anyone that would listen to me, my story, but no one believed me, everyone thought I was a monster, and said I deserved what was coming to me.

I haven't got much longer left in this world, so this could be my last statement, I just hope if someone reads this, they understand that I didn’t hurt anyone, well, at least I don’t remember doing so, and if I did, I am truly sorry.

*Missing Twin. Have you seen him?* ***CASH REWARD***.

*-do NOT contact me with unsolicited services or offers*

I have a, uh, *hobby* of skimming CraigsList while drunk. Most of the time I’ll stick to **Discussion** posts for my area, sometimes I’ll check out **Gigs** or **For Sale**. But my favorite category was **Lost and Found**. You can learn a lot about your neighbors based on the things they lose and how hard they try to get things back. I’ve seen weird posts before--lost refrigerator, crystal skull, once even a missing prosthetic leg--but “missing twin” was a horse of a whole different flavor. And it was so...casual.

There was already a hangover headed my way, so I figured another beer or two wouldn’t add much to the damage. At that point, I was already roaring drunk, teetering right on the edge of a blackout but not quite there yet. After another beer, I made a mistake that ended up costing me a lot.

I replied to the Craigslist ad.

***Hi. I think I might be your missing twin. How are things?***

I’m not sure why I sent that. I remember being bored, fuzzy, and curious. I also remember being *so* close to closing my laptop and calling it a night. Then the owner of the Craigslist ad replied almost immediately.

***I missed you.***

“Oh. We got a live one,” I slurred, opening another beer.

That was the drink that sent me over the “hammered but aware” cliff plummeting down into Wasted Valley. I woke up the next morning with a headache like somebody opened a strip mine behind my eyeballs.

There were twenty-six unread emails in my inbox.

I took a leak, then returned to my living room (still in my underwear) and plopped down on the couch with my computer. Heavy curtains kept out painful sunshine. The only light came from the blue glow of my laptop screen. It wasn’t even bright enough to reveal the bottles and clothes and Chinese takeout boxes scattered around my apartment. I opened the first email.

***Twin where did you go?***

My heart crawled up to my throat. The Craigslist weirdo had my email. Did I give him my email address the night before? Sometimes I got a little too trusting when I blacked out.

Damn. Damn. Damn.

I opened another email, then another. All were from the Craiglist poster and all were some variation of asking me where I went. For some reason, I felt compelled to open all of them. The last message was a single word.

***Meet?***

I closed the laptop and rubbed my temple. My hangover was shifting into a higher gear. Shit. So a rando on Craigslist had my email. Not the end of the world though...my full name was part of the email address.

Shit.

It was a common name. And I lived in a big city. I should be safe. That’s what I kept telling myself all day as I lay curled on the couch, TV droning unwatched behind me. I ordered tacos from DoorDash. I slept. When I checked my computer again, there were another eight messages.

I decided to retire the email address and close the account. I figured the Craiglister was just an oddball. Harmless. It was back to the usual routine after that. My hangover was barely a greasy echo by the time I went to work the following day. Riding on the subway that morning, a strange sensation, little hairs prickling on the back of my neck.

Someone was watching me.

I scanned the crowded subway car but didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary. The sensation of being watched stuck with me until I reached my stop. Then, in a blink, it was gone. Yet the memory lingered with me all through the morning as I sat in my cubicle. I was distracted, unable to work, staring at a blank spreadsheet for an hour. Somehow, I made it to lunch. I bolted from the office like a racoon from a burning dumpster.

The moment I left the building, I felt the sensation again. My watcher. I hurried through the city, dodging people on the sidewalk. When there was a gap in the press, I turned to see if I was being followed. A man was standing in the middle of the road blocking traffic. He was too far away to see clearly though there was something familiar about him. Cars were honking but he stood scarecrow-still.

Then he waved.

No matter how many turns I took or intersections I sprinted through, the feeling clung to me. Eventually, I ducked into a grimy pub, nearly slipping on a puddle of *unidentified* liquid at the door. It was dark in the room. I slid into a corner booth, keeping my eye on the entrance. My hands were shaking. For the first time in my life, I felt hunted.

After a few minutes of watching the door without anyone coming in, I let out a breath and slouched into the booth. Maybe I’d lost my watcher. The relief lasted about twenty seconds. That’s when I noticed the man leaning against the bar. He was staring at me, smiling. I didn’t recognize him at all and he had a face I’d remember: watery eyes, a broken nose badly set, and teeth like little gravestone. I realized why he seemed familiar: the stranger was dressed exactly like me. *Exactly*. Same tan chinos, same blue button-down shirt. Same haircut.

It was like looking at my reflection in a funhouse mirror.

When the man saw I was aware, he picked up two beers from the bar, walked over, and sat down opposite me in the booth.

“Finally found you,” he said, voice higher than I expected.

“Do I know you?” I was weighing my options, wondering if I should bolt to the door.

“Such a joker,” the stranger said, letting out a little chuckle. “You’ve been a bad twin. I missed you.”

I leaned back. “Dude, I have no idea who you are.”

The stranger looked down at the table. “I know this is unusual. I apologize. I...my brother...he passed away a few years back. It really left a *hole*. You know how they say twins have an extra bond, that they can sense each other? With him gone, that feeling I had my whole life just faded out. Imagine looking up at the sky every night and all of a sudden there are no more stars and never will be again.”

“I...don’t know what to say.”

“This isn’t your problem. I’m sure I’m freaking you out. You see, I post those ads as a coping mechanism. Sometimes, people play along and, for a moment, it’s like he’s back. That’s all I thought this was but I can see I’ve upset you. I apologize.”

The stranger blinked his wet blue eyes and nodded to himself. I was at a bit of a loss.

“I think, maybe, this is a misunderstanding?” I offered. “I shouldn’t have replied to your ad.”

“I came on strong. How about one beer, we part ways, and I won’t bother you again.”

Some part of my brain--an old part that developed long ago when we still had to watch the tall grass for hungry eyes--it was warning me to leave. But I was so relieved to find out that my watcher was a sad man, not some monster. What was the harm in one drink?

I woke up with my cheek pressed against cold concrete. This was the grandmother of all hangovers. I wanted to touch my head to check for a buried axe but my hands were stuck; tied behind my back. I was laying on the floor in the dark.

“We don’t really look much alike,” a voice whispered from somewhere nearby. “I was awfully depressed to see that. Not twins at all. Not yet.”

“What the shit?” I mumbled, face a little numb.

There was the *pop* of a lightbulb. In the yellow-orange glow, I saw I was in an empty storage unit, the type you’d rent to fill with boxes of junk and old furniture. There were mattresses duct taped to the walls. The stranger from the bar was standing over me. Light caught on the edge of the straight razor he was unfolding. We were still dressed the same.

He leaned down. “If I can’t look like you, little twin, maybe we can change things. Rearrange. *Trim*.”

I remember screaming for a long time. The mattresses...they must have been good soundproofing. No one came looking no matter how loud I shrieked. The pain was everywhere. It started at my face but it lit up every nerve, a scalding electric feeling that left me shaking. I’ve never tasted so much blood.

My last memory inside the storage unit was the stranger sitting down at my feet. He was crying.

“Not good enough,” he said. “Not even close.”

Another blackout washed over me and I prayed I wouldn’t wake up. That it would be over.

This time when I opened my eyes, I saw a white light. Then a shadow leaned down. I would have screamed if my mouth wasn’t full of something soft and dry.

“Still with us?” a voice asked.

I mumbled.

“Don’t try talking,” the voice continued. “Your mouth, your tongue, uh, there’s some damage. But you’re safe now. You’re in the hospital.”

I reached for my face. Cotton bandages covered everything from my neck to my scalp. They were wet, my fingers sticking briefly before I pulled them away.

I’m still not sure why the stranger stopped cutting me. Maybe he wasn’t seeing whatever he hoped to find. So he dumped me outside an ER and disappeared.

The doctors tell me I have options. Reconstructive surgery is always evolving, they say, always improving. With time and luck, I might be able to get about 75% back to normal. Maybe even 80%. I still don’t look when they change the bandages. Eventually, I’ll have to.

For the time being, I like to distract myself. They lent me a laptop and I’ve been trying to write; keeping a journal. I’m not sure why I checked Craigslist this morning but I felt drawn to it.

The post was only a few hours old. The location had shifted from downtown to the north side of the city but the wording was horribly familiar.

"It's not blood that binds us but tradition. Customs that we live by, that we cherish and pass on to our children when they grow old enough. Tradition is everything to this family and as you are a part of it, you have no choice but to value and live by our rules."

That's literally what I've been told on the car ride to each family function we've ever had. I'm not kidding. Either my father or mother will say those exact same words. One time I jokingly said them myself before either of them could, but then my mum repeated them anyway acting like she didn't hear me.

They emphasize the importance of tradition so much because they know I can't stand our holiday evening with the extended family. To be honest, I can't stand those people in general. You see, my extended family is incredibly odd. They always have been, forever will be, and every time I see their peculiar faces, I notice even more how strange everything about them is. Especially now that I am growing older.

My grandma was a horrible woman, my uncles are greedy, rude men, my aunts do nothing but pick you apart. And don't even get me started on my cousins. Loud, annoying, and incredibly disgusting little kids that make one evening together feel like being stuck inside a dreadful school cafeteria for an entire month. Luckily, I don't see them often. We only ever get together during the holidays in December. So technically it's not a bad deal, a night spent with the sticky cousins for a year of peace from this family.

My aunt Margaret always hosts. It used to be my grandmother before she passed away a few years ago. As my aunt inherited the house, she also took over the pleasure of being the host for holidays.

"Welcome home my lovelies!" Aunt Margaret stood on the porch of the familiar old house as we got out of the car. Her red hair was blow-dried, she was wearing a violet dress that looked like it should have been left in the fifties as well as grandma's familiar apron with lemons on it.

Mum jumped up the stairs with the kind of energy she never usually has and gave her sister a big hug. Dad followed with the bottle of wine they bought in one hand and a bouquet of flowers in the other.

"Happy holidays, Margie!" He said as he gave her a kiss on the cheek. Everything was exactly the same as always, which meant that I was next.

Margaret waited for me as I made the last step up the stairs to the porch, then she gave me a hug so tight that I felt this morning's breakfast moving up to my throat. Her lavender perfume wasn't exactly helping the sudden nausea I got.

"Oh Mel, how big you've grown!" She said through those lipstick-stained teeth. "How old are you now? Sixteen?"

I nod.

"Yeah, my birthday was a month ago."

It's not like any of them sent a card or bothered to call.

"Still a little too young, I suppose," she whispered and I felt her hot breath against my ear.

As we got into the spacious entry hall more uncles and aunts appeared to greet us. Kids were running around, playing and it already felt like being inside a zoo.

I got two wet kisses from aunt Tully and Trudy, the twins, as well as a handshake from each of their respective spouses. Uncle Ted and uncle Theo who both smell like ashtrays gave me hugs and made some stupid jokes as the entire company made their way to the winter garden where the rest of the adults were having a drink. That's where we usually sit around and do chit-chat before dinner time.

I could already feel the headache settle in as well as the fear that Margaret might want my help when a hand grabbed me and pulled me back.

"Matteo!" I exclaimed happily. I was already afraid he somehow got out of coming this year. Matteo was the only cousin that I can actually stand. Maybe because he's the only one that is almost my age, less than two years older. Usually, he was the only one that made dinner a little fun for me but last year my only decent cousin was invited to the adult's table while I had to stay with the kids. The table arrangement is a pretty big deal to this family, we don't even sit in the same rooms.

My cousin looked exactly the same as last year, only an inch or two taller. From our looks, you'd never guess that we're related. Matteo has dark curly hair, mine is straight and blonde. He has blue eyes, mine are brown. He's pale and I'm tan. The only thing we have in common is the absurd clothes we have to wear because of the dress code. My mother left the purple satin dress with a bow around the waist on my bed this morning, and with it, I had to put on those horrible black patent shoes. Matteo wears a black shirt and around his neck is the bow tie in the same shade of purple as my dress.

Our family color.

"Come with me," Matteo whispered and I followed. We walked all the way through the house to the garden which is on the opposite side of the building to the winter garden where the rest of the family was.

We sat down on the stairs that lead down to the grass and Matteo pulled out something from his pocket.

He grinned as he showed me the joint he apparently rolled this morning.

"Wanna start our own family tradition?"

I anxiously looked back at the house.

"They won't notice, don't worry," he said and pulled out a lighter.

"So, how have you been the past year?" He asked after we sat there for a while.

I shrug.

"Pretty much the same as always, how about you?"

"Yeah, same. You know, I wanted to call you the other day. Couldn't find your number anywhere though. When I asked my dad he just said no."

Like I said, our families only ever get together during the holidays. We're never in touch except for that.

"He said no?" I laughed but Matteo stayed serious.

"Weird, right? I also tried to find you online but without luck. Anyway, do you remember the last time we were here?" He said while biting his nail.

"Uhm, yeah. But we didn't really talk then. Remember I had to stay at the kiddies table?"

Now his eyes opened wide.

"You didn't eat with us?"

"Okay, how much of this did you smoke?" I laughed again.

"It's so weird, Mel, I hardly remember last year and when we got ready to drive down today I felt so strange about-,"

"There you guys are!" a shrill voice behind us interrupted him.

"Aunt Margie," I said, trying to think of an excuse already but she didn't seem to care what we were doing. "The sun's almost down, come on, come on, it's dinner time!"

We got up and she put her two arms around each of us. "Mel, honey, I know you're still a little young but turns out your uncle Tobias didn't make it so we have a spare seat at our table! Isn't that marvelous?"

\--

And so I finally was invited to sit with the adults of the family for dinner.

I'd never been inside the dining room before, it was much more spacious than I imagined. The wooden table in the middle of the room could seat at least 10 more people, I didn't understand why I was never allowed to sit with them before.

The room was next to the one for the children, though we didn't hear a sound from next door. Around this time they were probably already being served the food by the kitchen staff. No fancy food. At the kid's table, we always got chicken nuggets, fries, stuff like that. I was curious to see what the adults were eating.

I sat down next to my mother who smiled with her mouth but not with her eyes. On the opposite side of the table was Matteo who looked confused which at that moment I blamed on the weed.

I looked at the table in front of me and was surprised to see that there was no food. No cutlery either.

We all had one plate with a little black box on it. I reached for it but before I knew what was happening, Margaret appeared beside me and slapped my hand.

"Not yet."

When I looked up again, I noticed that all the adults were watching me. I swallowed, suddenly wishing I was in the other room with the kids. The atmosphere in the room was so tense and I didn't understand why.

Until Margaret took a seat at the head of the table.

"Welcome, family. It's not blood that binds us but tradition. Customs that we live by, that we cherish and pass on to our children when they grow old enough. Tradition is everything to this family and as you are a part of it, you have *no choice* but to value and live by our rules."

I swallowed.

"I realize it hasn't been the same since mother left," she continued. "She was the heart of our holiday after all but with all the obstacles thrown my way I still try to do my best."

"And you do it so wonderfully!" Trudy shouted out in glee although something about her speech pattern sounded forced.

"Why thank you, sister. I am glad to see our family grow," she looked at me when she said that, and for some reason, a shiver went down my spine.

"Should we help you serve dinner?" I asked so that the awkward moment would pass by more quickly.

Everyone laughed in response.

Confused, I looked at Matteo but his expression was empty.

"Now, family. It is time for our tradition. Please open your boxes."

Everyone immediately grabbed the box in front of them so I did the same.

I lifted the upper part only to realize that it was empty. I looked over at mom's and it was empty too. So were the ones of dad, Matteo, and pretty much everyone else it appeared.

Except for Theo's.

He'd dropped the lid and rested his hands on the table. Aunt Margaret got up and walked towards my uncle to take out what was lying inside the box.

A knife.

She smiled at Theo who turned his hands around so that his palms were facing upward. With the knife, she cut inside his left hand first, then the right hand. Theo moved his hands up above the plate in front of him so that the blood from the fresh wound would be collected inside of it.

I felt incredibly uneasy, close to throwing up. The weirdest part about all of it was the fact that nobody reacted. They stayed still, sitting, watching. And as I looked through the room, I realized that I was doing the same thing.

I opened my mouth to speak but no words came out. I tried to move but my body wouldn't listen. We continued watching as aunt Margaret dipped her index finger into the blood and started drawing a strange symbol on the forehead of Theo.

She whispered words I didn't understand and when she was done, Theo finally got up from his chair and the two of them started hugging.

"For this year you will be mine. If you prove worthy, we will all meet again during our holiday in the next year," she finally said.

The rest of the evening felt even stranger. Aunt Margaret led Theo upstairs where his hands were cleaned and sewn. After they came back the kitchen staff started serving the food.

There was roast, goose, and duck. Mashed potatoes, gravy, and green beans. Pudding, cakes, and biscuits. Food that you might find if you looked up *festive dinner* online.

The family started laughing and putting food on their plates.

But nobody ate. I'm not even sure if any of the food was edible.

They were merely acting out a dinner party and even though I knew something was wrong, even though I felt the fear growing and growing inside of me, I couldn't do anything but join. Join the fake dinner and the fake laughter. It was as if something else was controlling me.

This continued until late at night when we finally started saying our goodbyes. We hugged, kissed, shook hands, and then every family got inside their respective cars.

\---

"Mel, you need to listen very carefully. As soon as we are far enough away, we will forget everything that happened tonight," my mother spoke calmly as my father started pulling out of the driveway.

"Mum, what the hell? What was that? Why-" I felt my heart racing inside my chest. All my thoughts felt scrambled.

"Mel, listen!" My father shouted. He was holding the steering wheel so tight that his knuckles got all white. He was trying hard not to shake as he slowly started the gas. Aunt Margaret was standing on the porch watching us.

The other family members were inside their cars, all in front of us. Except for Theo. I saw him through the window. He stood there with an expression of fear and hopelessness in his eyes.

"This is not our family. We are not related to those people. We come here each year. We don't know why. We once got tricked into it and every year since we get in the car on that particular day and we arrive at this house," my mother said.

I wanted to say something but decided to stay quiet instead.

"We forget about everything as soon as we leave and the next year we drive here again. Whatever we do, they manage to pull us back here. We believe the same is happening to those other people who you think are your aunts and uncles but we don't know for sure," she continued.

"We have no way out of this. And now they have decided that you are an adult," my father said. He was driving so slowly that I could still see Margaret waving through the exterior mirror of the car.

"Dad, why are you going so slow," I whispered. The sight of her was scaring me even more now. My entire body felt like it was simultaneously frozen and on fire.

"As soon as we leave the street, we will forget. We just wanted you to know, even if you will forget, that we are sorry and we should have told you sooner. We thought we had another year before they declared you an adult."

"What's going to happen to Theo?" I finally dared to ask.

"We might see him again next year. If things go well for him. If she is happy. She'll let him leave and he will be replaced by another family member."

All those years I remembered our odd family dinners. Except, I was never a part of the real tradition. I was with the kids which were annoying but not horrifying.

All those thoughts were racing through my mind. Matteo knew that something was wrong but he couldn't communicate it, he couldn't remember everything. I closed my eyes as we drove down the street and made a turn. I held my breath almost all the way until we were on the freeway.

"Were you ever chosen?" I finally asked. "Did one of you ever stay with her?"

I knew that made little sense because if my parents were gone for a year I'm sure I would have remembered.

"I am so full, what an incredible dinner," my father suddenly said.

"I know, right? How does Margie do it?" my mum rubbed her stomach and giggled.

"Mum, dad?" I whispered.

"Next year we should contribute, maybe I could bake something," she continued.

They never spoke about it again. When speaking of family they would only repeat that bullshit about tradition. Of course, I tried to tell them but they'd forgotten everything right away and looked at me as if I was losing my mind.

But I remember everything.

I'm not sure why maybe because I technically joined the adults a year early. I know that my parents must know as well, buried somewhere deep inside of them. I notice the twitch in their eye when I speak about Margaret or any of the other *family* members.

I have tried so much though and convincing them seems next to impossible. I finally gave up and decided to start looking for Matteo instead.

So far I've had no luck. No phone number and I haven't found any of his social media either.

It's gotten so far that I almost started believing my parents. Believing that I was imagining things, that I was losing my mind.

However, almost before I gave up, I did find something else.

I remembered that one person never showed up to dinner.

Uncle Tobias.

So again, after a lot of research, I found something about this man who I don't believe is related to us either. And I believe that a part of him knew what he might have been facing that day.

He never showed up because he committed suicide on the day of the [family dinner.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Likeeyedid/)

It’s been a few days since I last was here. To be perfectly honest, I didn’t think that I would be back on here to tell my story. By that, I mean I didn’t think that I would be alive. (Sigh) 

I know what you all are thinking. Did I get a priest? Did I do a séance? Did I use an Ouija board to speak to Angie? See, I haven’t been completely honest with you. There is a twist to this story and I know why Angie may be calling me. 

Let’s back up some, Angie and I dated for 3 years before she proposed to me. But when I gave her the answer “Yes”, she explained to me that we were making a pact. That if one of us dies…we would be alone, forever! No one new, no past flings, just alone. 

There was no until death do us part. 

Obviously, I thought this was just a little cute relationship thing. You know? Kinda how MGK got that ring that would never come off Megan’s finger without causing pain. That’s something that I thought was happening here. Just shits and giggles . 

I was wrong …

When I got with Sarah, I broke that pact. 

I love Sarah. There is no way I would ever leave her or abandoned her for Angie. Angie is dead and she needs to get a grip. I mean if this truly is her. I think to myself. I just want to be happy! I’ve moved on. No I am not being bitter but, I’m still young. I have needs, wants and desires and I can’t spend the rest of my life grieving over my fiancé. I mean…technically we never even had the chance to say the magic words. So why is she calling me? 

These thoughts haunt me and I’ve been trying to keep my shit together so Sarah doesn’t figure any of this out. 

I just got off work and like always, I have just about an hour or so with Sarah before she goes into the graveyard shift. We kiss, say our goodbyes and our I love yous. 

Just like clock work. My phone rings…

Caller ID- “Angie”. 

Contemplating on answering the call. Deciding between green or red. 

I pushed the button. 

Called declined..I chose red. 

I waited 15 minutes to see if she would call back. 

Hm. This is just some fucking prank from a kid. I thought. 

(Ring, ring, ring) 

My heart skipped 12 beats. 

Caller ID- “Sargent Buzzbee” 

“Hey sir, how are you?”

“All is well Deputy Williams. Just called to see if you’d be able to come in for some overtime. I know you come in at 630am anyways. How about 4:30?”

“Su-sure sir!” I stutter trying to gather my breathing. 

“Thanks Deputy Williams, our new recruit just found out she has Covid. I appreciate your hard work. See you bright and early. Well, how about early and not bright!” 

He always had weird jokes. 

“Yes sir, goodnight now.”

It’s been a long day. I decided to go take a nice shower. That’s something I always enjoy when I’m stressed. It feels like a small escape from life. I get in the shower and I’m lathering myself with soap. 

It’s super steamy, but through the clear shower curtain I see a silhouette standing in the doorway of our master bathroom. 

“Babe, is that you? Did you forget your lunch again?”

Silence. 

“Sarah..”

I have soap everywhere. I don’t know if my eyes are playing tricks on me but, I can’t see as sharp with all this steam. 

The silhouette moves closer to the curtain.

I push the curtain back. 

(Gasp) 

It’s not Sarah. 

The left side of her face has 4th-degree burns. Her right eye is missing the eyelid so that eye always looks open. One of her ears are just a disgusting hole oozing what looks to be puss. Her fingers look like they’ve been melted together. A hole in her left check the size of a goofball barley holding on by a thin piece of tendon revealing her bloody gums. 

With a raspy and dry voice she says “Surprise Dean, did you miss your old bride to be?” 

She was holding an 8inch hunting dagger right to my jugular vein. More specifically the one I got her on our 1st year anniversary. I knew she loved to hunt. 

It was Angie. She was mad…and she was NOT DEAD!

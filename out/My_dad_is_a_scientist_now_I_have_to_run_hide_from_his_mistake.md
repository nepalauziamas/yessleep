My dad has been working on combining humans with animals, he started focusing on his work even more when my mom passed away a few years ago. His latest experiment was successful, kind of.

It was a normal day, I was just up in my room playing video games, I went down to the kitchen to get a snack, that's when I hear growling and what sounded like the tearing of flesh coming out of the basement, the door was opened slightly so I cautiously opened, thinking maybe my dog, Jessie, had found a squirrel or something.

Instead, what I found was my dad's dead body on the ground, and an amalgamation of what looked like my younger brother, and Jessie.

The hideous creature war tearing the flesh of my dad's bones. It stopped, sniffed the air for a second then glared at me, all I could see was my helpless little brother and my dog or 5 years staring at me.

After what felt like an eternity, but was more like 5 seconds, the creature threw my dad's mangled corpse to the side and started running up the stairs after me. My heart was beating and my mind was racing, "how could my dad do this!" I thought.

I bolted our of there, tried to shut and lock the door, but the creature was too strong and broke through.

I ran as fast I could through the house, trying to find a phone or something. I ran through the kitchen trying to throw stuff at it, I even threw some steak from the fridge past it, hoping it would go for that instead of me, but to no prevail.

 I thought maybe I could grab my dad's shotgun from his room, but then I remembered that the closet was locked and I had no idea where the key was. 

I thought maybe running out of the house, but based on where I was, there was no way I could get there, I would have to past the monster, but there was no way to get passed it without being mauled like a gazelle. 

The creature was gaining on me, I managed to make it to my room, I tried calling the police but they just laughed at me and told me I've been watching too many scary movies. I wish my mom was still alive, she would have been able to talk some sense into my dad so he would have never used his own son in his experiment! That doesn't matter now, all that matters is that I get out of this.

So now here I am in my room with the door locked and my dresser, desk and chair in front of the door, typing this out, if you could, please send help, I don't know how much time I've got left. God! I wish my room had a window! Why didn't I go to my dad's room, I would have been able to get out of here that way!

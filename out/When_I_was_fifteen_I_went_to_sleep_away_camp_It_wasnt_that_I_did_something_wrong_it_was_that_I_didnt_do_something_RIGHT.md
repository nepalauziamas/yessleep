I won't name the exact place for fear someone might try and go there and find her. I can't be responsible for that.

I didn't want to go at first. I begged, pleaded, maybe even cried a little but my friends Eric and Jimmy were going and that was the sword my parents used to cleave through my complaints.

"You'll be with your friends. It's only a few weeks and it'll be a good experience for you to be a little independent for once," my mom said.

Independence, hell yes, just not at a stupid sleep-away camp.

Drop off was on a Sunday. The air was thick and spongy, a hazy sky threatening rain, basically your typical August sweat-fest. My younger brother Matty had a fever the night before and with my dad working, my mom couldn’t leave him so I had to catch a ride with Eric. I remember accusing Matty of being a little baby and lying about being sick just to get attention, (something not uncommon in our house but on this occasion completely untrue) which of course infuriated my mom. She rarely yelled but for some reason this seemed to penetrate her calm and she exploded on me. Looking back it wasn’t about Matty, it wasn’t about my Mom, it was about me. I was afraid. Afraid of something new. Something different. Something unknown.

Eric was slightly more excited about the camp than I was. Of the three of us he had the sunniest disposition. Nothing really ever bothered him. I think that was especially true that summer because he knew he was leaving our small town and going to boarding school next year. His dad was a big ad exec who commuted to the city, something mostly unheard of where we lived and they lived in a gigantic waterfront house. Everything always seemed easy for him but looking back I never considered how different he must have felt sometimes. He never showed it though. His armor was an easy smile and quick wit but over the course of our two hour drive, I was able to wear him down and get him firmly on board with my theory that this was going to be the worst weeks of our lives.

If I’d only know that would actually come true...

I remember as Eric’s mom turned off the highway, it was like we were entering another world. The trees were suddenly taller, long branches with broad leaves standing guard over this ancient green kingdom. A mile or two later we approached the entrance to the camp, a dirt field which gave way to well trodden grass with the silhouettes of the cabins beyond. A permanent dust cloud hung over it. I remember Eric’s mom being frustrated because no matter how much she cranked the wind shield wipers a new film settled moments later.

A kaleidoscope of metallic colors glinted through the swirling dust as cars arrived. I stared as kids my age and older, my size and bigger spilled out. Some looked hypnotized, in a state of disbelief of their current whereabouts, while others were loudly greeting friends from years gone by. And still others were sobbing. I watched one boy who oddly enough looked like me but with slightly longer hair. He locked himself in the car after his parents had gotten out. I never got to see how that self-hostage situation was resolved.

Oh, and there were girls. It was a co-ed camp with fairly rigid separation as we would learn. I was in that awkward phase where a girlfriend was pretty much a rumor but subconsciously my stance on the whole opposite sex issue began to soften about that time.

Eric’s mom ushered us out. As I was grabbing my backpack and duffel out of the trunk, I felt a sharp sting on the back of my neck. Initially I thought it was a bee and I’d already envisioned Eric’s mom leaving with one passenger in tow due to a slight allergy to bee stings...but it wasn’t. I heard Jimmy’s unmistakable howl and turned to see my friend with a palmful of pebbles in his hand. That was Jimmy, all fun, all the time. He was smaller than Eric and I but completely fearless. I’d seen him take on kids twice his size and win.

As Eric and Jimmy’s moms jabbered away, the three of us stood in the dust and for a moment, my fears slipped away and we seemed invincible. The three of us. Together. This camp didn’t stand a chance.

Eric’s moms goodbye went on entirely too long. I did miss not having my own mother to hug and assure me that it was going to be fun and someday I’d look back on this experience as a moment of change and growing up. One of those sentiments all these years later I wish I'd express to her more at the time.

As the moms finally pulled away it did feel different. It somehow felt right. Like we were about to do something epic on our own.

The cabins were split by a great lawn nearly a football field in length. Boys on one side, girls on the other, both divided by age. The counselors lined us up and cross-checked everyone’s name on the list. A simmering anarchy rose over the field, veteran campers seeing one another again for the first time since last summer, new campers trying to find their place and counselors attempting not to lose their shit in the first few hours.

This was the around the time I first noticed her, not Allison R. from cabin six, my first real crush but the very tall girl standing at the back of the line, drifting near the edge of the woods as if she was trying to disappear back into them. I thought it was a maintenance worker or some other camp employee and frankly a man because of her sheer size. Her broad shoulders were hunched and she slouched as if she was trying to hide her odd proportions in all the chaos but she had to be over six feet tall, maybe more. Her shirt and pants were oversized and ill fitting but you could still discern there was a solid frame beneath. She was built *differently*. She had a backpack double strapped tightly over her shoulders and the top met the length of her neatly cut hair. Something jutted out of the unfastened side of the pack. A doll of some kind.

Eric elbowed me, he’d noticed her too. “Holy shit, she’s huge...” I didn’t respond. He and Jimmy shared a snicker, then moved on to other faces in the crowd. Everyone was sizing everyone else up, looking for commonality, targeting difference.

I couldn’t take my eyes off the girl and eventually she must’ve felt it and met my stare. Even at that distance I froze, embarrassed, sure, but it was as if she’d come alive in that instant. She remained expressionless but there was just something powerful about her eyes. There was a story there. A story that wanted to be told. I quickly looked away but could feel her linger on me a moment as if she didn't want to break the connection. Out of the corner of my eye I saw her head lower again and she receded back into the crowd.

I should've walked over and said hello or good morning. Introduced myself and asked how she was doing, where she was from...anything. But I didn't.

Our cabin had four other boys in it. One whose name I can’t remember was our age but the others were all seventeen or eighteen. It wasn’t long until a serious *Lord of the Flies* vibe set in. The ring leader was a kid named Cory. He sucked. It was like he’d gone to bullying school and graduated with honors already. The other idiots just fell in line with him and it was obvious they’d had a few summers together to sharpen their craft.

The problem for them is they hadn’t encountered a Jimmy before. I knew we had a secret weapon and part of me wanted them to just keep prodding it enough for it to explode and annihilate them.

Things came to a head the first night. We’d gotten back from some boring orientation, “meet your fellow camper” thing and I was lying in my bottom bunk. Eric got stuck with the kid whose name I can’t remember and Jimmy was above me.

Given some downtime, thoughts about how bad I wanted to go home began to creep back into my head. I stared at the cracks in the bunk frame above me, started to find strange faces in them and was in the beginnings of a possible scenario where they might begin talking and perhaps even possess me to put me out of my misery, when a shadow fell over me.

It was Cory and the idiots. They’d decided I was the weak link in the new herd and they were about to pounce.

“Hey fuckstick. That’s your name, right? Fuckstick?”

It was so predictable and generic, I really wanted to ask him if his mother was proud her son was dumber than a rock but instead, instinct kicked in and I sat up and swung one leg out of bed, braced for what might be coming. My dad had taught me how to throw a punch and I’d wrestled for a few years so I knew how to handle myself but I didn’t want this fight. I didn’t want most fights. I was ok with just letting it be. It was if they knew that and it was fueling them.

Cory took my water bottle out of my bag, opened the lid and soaked me. The idiots laughed, braying like hyenas.

“Did you like that, Fuckstick?”

Then he was crumpled on the floor, bleeding.

It all happened so fast. Jimmy had been watching from his perch above. Watching and waiting. He’d decided the water bottle crossed his red-line and launched off the top bed. He delivered such a quick, explosive beating that the idiots didn’t have time to react, let alone jump in. I got my ass out of bed too, just to make sure they didn’t.

Jimmy didn’t say a thing, didn’t gloat, he didn’t need to. He just looked at the three of them and made it clear it would be worse next time if they decided to fuck with us again. Word did get back to the counselors of an “incident” but Cory’s bloody, possibly broken nose was explained away as an unfortunate case of walking into a door face first.

Things were just different back in the day. Seemed you could get away with more. Kids scraped their knees on the pavement, fell out of a tree and broke their arms. They had scars. It wasn’t that bad things didn’t happen, the news just didn’t travel as fast.

I met Allison the next day. First kiss a few nights later but this isn’t about that. This is about telling you what really happened that summer, what they covered up.

This is about Jane and what they drove her to do.

I didn’t know at the time but it started before someone hung her doll from the big oak which marked the dividing line between the girls and boys cabins. Boys can be mean but girls can be downright cruel.

On the fourth or fifth day, we were on our way back from the field when kids started gathering on the great lawn. A low murmur rose interrupted by the occasional obnoxious cackle.

Hanging from the lowest branch of the great oak was a two foot doll. The face was strangely life like, not overly cherubic like most plastic toys but elegantly carved and made with care. The long hair seemed real, finely threaded into what appeared to be a wooden scalp. The doll wore overalls, their stitching also expertly done. A rope had been tied around both her hands and looped over the bough, effectively hanging her like a medieval prisoner on the rack.

We all stopped and stared. The angle the doll’s head lolled gave it an almost ebbing life. Then the crowd began to part and I saw her head loom over everyone. Jane slowly walked to the tree. I was awestruck at the power of her stride. Something that size moving so effortlessly. Wordlessly, she reached up to the tall branch and untied the knot of the loop, let the doll ride the slack down into her other waiting hand. She looked it over, carefully. Meticulously.

A girl, yelled “Is that your only friend, you freak?!”

A wave of laughter swept through the crowd. Jane turned, gaze still on her doll. When she finally looked up everyone fell into a hush. Her eyes were cold, unfeeling. Almost inhuman, like the eyes of a shark. She scanned the crowd, as if she knew who did it then silently walked back to her cabin.

By this time the counselors intervened and everyone dispersed. I didn’t know who did it but heard from Allison that one of the female counselors, a college girl named Tessa was in on it. She let the girls in her cabin drink and seemed more than happy to stir up trouble.

We began to hear rumors about Jane: That her family owned some of the land the camp was on. That Jane wasn’t her real name, that it was an alias because she committed some awful crime. That she lived in the woods and ate animals. That she killed her parents. That she was a circus freak that escaped. And on and on. But it seemed no one really knew anything about her, other than her name was Jane.

I should have said I was sorry that happened to her and that kids sucked sometimes. I should have asked if she wanted to hang with me and Eric and Jimmy. I should have...but I didn’t.

The next night it got worse.

We didn’t see it happen but we heard the aftermath. Tessa and her underlings locked Jane in one of the bathrooms.

There was a central hub for each set of cabins that had toilets and showers but there was also a single stall out near a maintenance shed. No one used it except the counselors and I don’t know how they lured her in there. Maybe she just wanted some privacy and they followed her.

We heard her deep, bellowing screams. Her fists pounding on the door. Her pleas for someone to please let her out. But no one did.

By the time other counselors and campers arrived it was quiet. When they opened the door, the bathroom was empty. The back window was completely shattered and a few boards had been torn out creating a hole large enough to escape.

At the time no one quite knew exactly what was going on and the counselors did their best to sequester us for the next day. A few of them partnered and searched for her on the camp grounds and as far as they dared go into the forest but there were no signs.

Jane was gone.

I’m sure calls were made to her parents and maybe the police, so we waited for someone to show up distraught, looking for her but no one did.

It was as if she didn’t exist. As if she didn’t matter.

Tessa went missing the next day. When she didn’t show for breakfast, they checked her room and found a familiar doll sitting upright in her bed instead. One of the campers heard they found a fistful of hair with chunks of scalp still attached to it near the door, as if whoever took her simply dragged her by the hair like a ragdoll.

Things descended into chaos at that point. This time the police did show up. Parents did too, demanding answers. We all left in a matter of hours. My mom picked us up this time. I’d never been so happy to see her.

Somehow, the news barely made the papers. But again, it was a different time. The owner of the camp had an in with some influential people and they managed to keep it mostly quiet. My best guess is money changed hands, probably more than a few times.

A local reporter did some digging and there were records of Jane from one of the nearby elementary schools but they stopped after the third or fourth grade and it was impossible to match the school girl photo to the Jane I knew.

Police-led search parties deployed and they combed the forest. They found several huge old, ramshackle long-houses hidden miles within its depths. The ceilings that weren't collapsed were over twenty feet high. The skeletal remains of an adult male and female were discovered buried behind the main cabin in a makeshift graveyard. The skeletons were abnormally large and according to a third hand account from the coroner several hundred years old with several peculiar anatomical anomalies. They also found the skeletons of three infants and four juveniles all with various defects.

In the surrounding forest they found burial mounds. They were filled with animal bones. The bones were scraped with what apparently resembled human-like teeth marks. Only larger than any human tooth could leave behind.

Allegedly, several tomes were recovered but none were “officially” recorded in any evidentiary findings. I’ve personally inquired about them and if they do exist, no one’s talking.

That same industrious local reporter alleged to have gotten a quick peek at one but was unable to transcribe more than a few notes. He never published his findings but I contacted him a few years back and got him talking over a bottle of wine. The tomes were nearly indecipherable, written in an ancient language resembling Germanic, perhaps an off shoot of an early strain of Latin. But what he ranted about most was that they were cobbled with a peculiar Runic text. He showed me his original notes. Strange symbols and words that just felt like they were from another time. A different, much older time. *Eoten* is the one that stuck with me. It’s an early English word derived from the Norse, *Jotunn*.

It roughly translates to, giant.

Eric, Jimmy and I remained close, even after college. Eric eventually moved overseas but Jimmy stayed local. A few years ago we got together and eventually talked about what happened. Talked about if we should’ve, if we could’ve done anything different to change it. A simple hello. A kind word may have changed everything. As close as we are I got the distinct impression neither wants to talk about it any more. They’ve locked it away in some dark corner of their minds where the stuff we don’t want to remember lies. And waits.

Despite wanting to forget, I’ve kept close tabs on any new information that trickles out relating to the incident. The occasional missing person in the area makes me wonder if someone wandered too far off the beaten path. I tried driving out to the camp once but they ran part of the highway across it and wilderness has somewhat filled in the rest. The woods looked as old and deep as they were all those years ago. I quelled an urge to just wander off and see if she would find me.

I think Jane’s still out there, surviving. Watching. Waiting for her time to come again. Maybe she isn't as alone as we think she is. Who knows how long they've adapted to hide in plain sight like she did.

But I always come back to the same haunting thought...It wasn’t that I did something wrong, it was that I DIDN’T do something right.

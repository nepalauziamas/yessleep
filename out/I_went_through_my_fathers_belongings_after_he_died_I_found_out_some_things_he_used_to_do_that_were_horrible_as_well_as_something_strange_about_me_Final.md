# Prefatory matters and Introduction

My name is Dr. Weston Grier. Today marks the beginning of a new step in both the realms of scientific possibility and the next evolution of human understanding. After almost nine years of research, hard work, and tireless dedication, we here at Monolith site D are ready to begin our most ambitious project yet since first establishing. The first step towards a larger world. "Project Demigod"

Hypothesis: We will bring a being from another realm; an immortal being, far elevated in every way from any mortal man, into our plane and, having it breed with a human, will bear a God into the world. We will give birth to god among men.

Method: Through various machinery (See attached diagrams), We will open the door between our realm and the realm we refer to simply as "The Veil", where a subject {CLASSIFIED DETAIL} will then enter and, utilizing a harness specially designed by our technicians, bind and bring back a worthy specimen for breeding. For the breeding process, we have selected five male subjects of varying backgrounds, ethnicities, body types and religions to see which would constitute the best result in a hybrid spawn of man and God.

Subject 1 is a caucasion male, 6'2", 235 lbs, Former Marine, unmarried, Catholic. Subject 2 is an Oriental male, 5'6", 185 lbs, Farmer and fisherman, Wife deceased, Buddhist. Subject 3 is an African American male, 5'9", 250lbs, cook in an Italian restaurant, Unmarried, Atheist. Subject 4 is a Hispanic male, 5'7", 230 lbs, Politician, Divorced, Christian. And Subject 5 is a Native American male, 6", 215lbs, owner of a metaphysical shop, unmarried, Wiccan -- practicing different forms of shamanism. Each subject was hand selected by the team of site D and are willing participants in this experiment, having signed a legal contract and term of agreement. Each have been promised $500 in remuneration for their participation in the project. Subjects were also noted to have no immediate families to speak of or next of kin.

The process of opening the door and accessing "The Veil" will commence at 1200 hours sharp.



**\*\*\***

# Entry 1

The first attempt of opening "The Veil" has ended in failure. Equipment was functional, but miscalculations were made with sending live subjects through. the first subject was unable to breach through before his flesh was inexplicably flash-seared from his bones. It is unknown at this time what it is that caused this reaction. Associates claim it could have been something with the supernaturally high levels of Ultraviolet radiation being emitted from the portal.

Adjustments are being made to account for this theory and we intend to begin another trial at this time tomorrow.



**\*\*\***

# Entry 2

For our next attempts of opening "The Veil", we took the liberty of selecting multiple subjects, whom I will henceforth be referring to as "Retrievers", all individuals who have little to no money and no known ties to community or next of kin to speak of. To gauge the most effective method for being able to survive the procedure, we tried various forms of UV protection for most of them. '

For example; the first of our "Retrievers" was stripped naked and covered from head to toe in multiple coatings of SPF 5,000. Another was given a radiation suit, one of our strongest tailored. the last was given nothing. The last "Retriever" would act as another sort of "control" for attempting to breach through a second time.

Each of these resulted in failure and loss of life for all three "Retrievers". Both the protected and unprotected were fried immediately upon contact with the doorway. This, naturally, has led to speculation that either the UV rays are far too strong for any man-made implements to protect against, or that there is something else entirely that is causing this result. At this time, we are unsure exactly how to proceed. Funding for the project was already at risk with the expenses in gathering the necessary implements. Because of this, we must tread carefully when proceeding further and do our best to make the next attempts a success.



**\*\*\***

# Entry 3

Another of the researchers of my team, Dr. Emil Pence, a theologist and professor of religion at the university, has given a new theory. It is his belief that because the realm in which we're attempting to access is largely similar to those spoken of in fiction (mainly children's fiction), that perhaps success can be yielded by utilizing a child. The primary idea behind this belief is that, because children's minds typically hold onto the possibilities of fantasy and innocence more than the minds of adults, they may stand a better chance at withstanding the forces being emitted form the doorway.

Most others are very skeptical to this theory. I, myself, am not entirely quick to attempt this, either. Though, I will admit that a part of me finds itself considering it as the more plausible solution. Of course, with this comes the question of where and how to obtain child volunteers for the project. Nevermind the question of ethics of that decision, there would also be MAJOR legal obstacles with it as well. As we are, yet again, at a complete loss of how to proceed, myself and the team are on a five day furlough, paid leave.

Hopefully, a short absence from the project will allow for a viable option to present itself when we return.



**\*\*\***

# Entry 4

After almost a week's leave, we still hadn't come to any viable conclusion. It was during our last conference that the idea of using children as "Retrievers" was brought into question once again. Like last time, most immediately dismissed the idea, primarily due to the far-fetched logic Pence presented with it. I, on the other hand, was a little more open to discussing the idea.

The dilemma presents itself once again; Where would we be able to find children who can volunteer for something as dangerous as this? I, personally, would be against it entirely, but I know of no other solutions at this time. Time is starting to run thin, as well, with sponsors and and contributors to the project expecting an update in only a few weeks. They're expecting results. I currently, however, only have failure.



**\*\*\***

# Entry 5

What I do next, I take no pride in. I will state for the record that this decision of mine did not come easily. It came only after many days and nights spent in long and drawn out contemplation, and even then, it would ultimately be the looming fear of the project being discontinued that decided me. What I do, I will also do without the assistance of many of the others; some of whom have defected on the project because of what I plan to do.

My plan is to adopt a handful of the children from the local orphanage to utilize as "Retrievers". If Pence's theory is correct, and I can only pray with all my heart that it is, then by utilizing the children's capacity for imagination, for their suspension of disbelief, they stand the best chance at being able to breach "The Veil" without themselves being harmed. May God have mercy on me and all of us for whatever may happen next.



**\*\*\***

# Entry 6

A couple of weeks have now passed with no progress on the project. We had to put everything on hold while attempting to ensure the department of social services would allow the children in our care. It's not like they'd have ever allowed us to have them if they knew of our real intention for them. The children have been living in the loft, off-site from the facility, for almost two weeks. Pence and on of the biologists of our team, Dr. Amelia Orne, have acted as the pseudo parental figures for that time. Yesterday was the finalization of the adoption process, and with that, the project may continue.

The first attempt with the children will commence promptly at 2300 hours tomorrow night.




**\*\*\***

# Entry 7

We have now had our first glimpse at success since the project's beginning! Pence's theory seemed to prevail, at least from an effective standpoint. Still not entirely sold on the science or reasoning behind it, but the result was there. Once opened, the modified "Retriever" was able to breach the doorway without being harmed. We now wait. We have  estimated it taking a minimum of five hours and a maximum of 8-10 for the "Retriever" to harness the specimen and make his way back through the doorway. It is at this time that I hold my breath and pray that "The Retriever" may emerge with our specimen.

* **Personal Note:** Four hours have elapsed now since sending in our "Retriever". During this time, I can't stop myself from imagining what that young man is seeing right now in there, in "The Veil". I remember how afraid he was when he was met with the opening of "The Veil". He's still so young. I wonder if he looks at any of it in fascination and wonder, as was characterized by Dr. Pence, or in terror, as I'm sure I and so many others would if faced with such as he is now. More than this, however, I can't, try as I would, quell the growing senses of shame for delving to such extremes as this. such is the pursuit of knowledge, I suppose.



**\*\*\***

# Entry 8

Hour twelve has passed, and there has been no activity from "The Veil". No sight nor sound has been reported from either the "Retriever" or anything/one else from the other side. Pence believes this is "Just a minor delay", to use his words. He estimates that this could be due to the "Retriever's" own sense of curiosity. In other words, He believes he is simply exploring "The Veil". This, of course is only speculation, given that we cannot see what the "Retriever" does, but it's the most sound conclusion presented thus far.

Dr. Pence has suggested that we wait a further three hours before attempting anything further.

* **Personal Note:** I can't help it. I feel as though he is in grave danger. Pence has advised that I and the others attempt to get some rest, but I can't sleep. I can't even *think* of sleeping. Not with him still in there, alone, faced with wonders that no grown man appears to be able to withstand. I can't close my eyes without seeing the look of cold, unbridled fear on his innocent face. It is now that the haunting query presents itself to me; the bane of all scientific ambitions, Will what we're doing be for the better for our fellow man, and if so, how steep a price must be paid to achieve it? At this time, I cannot conclusively answer this.



**\*\*\***

# Entry 9

The three hours have passed, along with an extra two for added measure. Still nothing from either the doorway or the "Retriever". This was when then "Retriever" was officially declared dead and this trial, another failure. At this time, the team and I are discussing what our next move should be. Most collectively agree that utilizing the another "Retriever" is a risky venture, not to mention, largely unethical. Dr. Pence, however, disagrees, advising to utilize another of them immediately. At this time, we are undecided, and we have so little time remaining to yield any results.



**\*\*\***

# Entry 10

Against the judgement of many of the others of the team, as well as my own conscience, we utilized another of our "Retrievers". This one was a little girl, the only one of the bunch. This adjustment was, of course, done at Dr. Pence's recommendation. It must be mentioned that it would be at this time that many more from the research team stepped away from the project for moral and ethical reasons, leaving only a fraction of our original crew left to continue.

At 2330 hours last night, we deployed the second "Retriever" through the doorway. Like with the first, almost a full 12 - 13 hours passed with no activity from the other side, before she, too, was declared a loss. Further use of the "Retrievers" is currently being debated.

* **Personal Note:** I cannot lie, my own faith in "Project Demigod" and it's merit has waned significantly since commencement. I can't blame those that've deserted the project. In truth, I felt compelled to do the same when I realized we'd sent yet another sweet, innocent child to their death. I'm honestly not sure how much longer I'll be willing to go on with any of this, myself. Dr. Pence is also beginning to worry me. Up to the present, he's not seemed to give any second thoughts about using the children. I'm sure the others feel the same. They see it, too; the way in which he all but directly sees them, not as children, but simply as tools. He is a brilliant man, and has built much rapport with the scientific community and with the higher ups of Monolith, but I'm finding myself wanting to trust him and his judgement less and less.



**\*\*\***

# Entry 11

Due to breach of conduct and ethics, Dr. Emil Pence has been withdrawn from any further involvement with the project. On a routine checkup of the remaining "Retrievers" in the loft, one of them notified me that he'd selected another of their number to be taken back to the site. At that time, I'd not been made aware of any decision to continue with another "Retriever" trial. This proved to be the case indeed when, asking the others why I'd not been notified, nor had any meeting been called to discuss the matter, they answered that this was because no such decision had yet been made.

When I went into the testing room, I found Dr. Pence guiding the "Retriever" into the doorway. I was too late to halt the procedure, and the third "Retriever" trial was set in motion, unauthorized. Upon interrogation, Pence explained that he'd devised a way to ensure the "Retriever's" return; through virtue of a stuffed teddy bear, theorizing that carrying the toy while inside would act as an anchor to our world, thus reducing the chances of getting lost inside "The Veil". Only five hours later, activity was reported from the other side doorway and, after about five minutes of intense energy spikes, the doorway opened, and from it emerged the unauthorized "Retriever", along with a live specimen.

The trial was a success. All the same, though, I couldn't tolerate a blatant violation such as this. It was unanimously agreed that Dr. Pence cannot be allowed any further involvement with "Project Demigod", for the safety and well being of ourselves and of others. At this time, primarily for our own protection from legal prosecution over this and first several losses of life, no criminal charges will be pursued against Dr. Pence.

* **Personal Note:** This situation has served to only further solidify my anxiety about whether or not our work here is justified by the principals of scientific discovery. On the one hand, it would of course be easy to say that Dr. Pence's actions were foolish and wrong; psychotic, even. Yet, at the same time, I can't help but wonder if, like me, he really did only have the best intentions with the larger picture as a whole. What he did was dangerous, not to mention deceitful, but, as stated in the report, it worked. We were successfully able to send and bring back a "Retriever", along with a live specimen. This has led me to ask one big, and damning, question; would I, in only a short matter of time more, have perhaps done the same?



\*\*\*

# Entry 12

With the success of the "Retrieval" aspect of the project, we have begun the second phase; the act of mating and breeding with the specimen. Specimen is mostly humanoid in appearance, resembling a female, judging from the vaginal genitalia, as well as the appearance of breasts. her body is slender, with light yellow skin that almost appears to be glowing, possibly emitting some sort of energy or aura from within her body. Specimen will be henceforth referred to as "Hera"; named after the Greek queen of the gods and the earth and mother of the mythical demigod, Hercules.

"Hera" appears to be mute, being without the appearance of a mouth. It is currently unknown if and/or how she is able to communicate. Also unknown at this time is what sort of adverse effects, if any, might be inflicted upon the breeding subjects after intercourse. We are left with only speculation for now. We began with Subject 3. He finished in about three minutes and escorted back to his quarters with the other four subjects. We intend to wait another month before making another attempt at breeding.



**\*\*\***

# Entry 13

Subject 3 has begun complaining of experiencing extreme migraines, nausea, and frightening hallucinations. Subject appears to be suffering insomnia as well, as testified from the the other subjects. Subject 3 will be given sleeping medication going forward. "Hera" has remained docile, almost catatonic, since interaction with Subject 3. Any attempts at stimulating her have resulted in nothing happening. In another week, we will attempt to breed again using another Subject.



**\*\*\***

# Entry 14

We utilized Subject 1 for the second breeding session. He was finished in five minutes. "Hera" reacted, in a way, perhaps more favorably to Subject 1 than Subject 3, judging from the way she appeared to submit more freely to him than the other. Of course, that is only a rough inference. Still so much is unknown about "Hera"; her mannerisms, her level of perception, and just her overall sense of emotion -- made all the more impossible to figure out by her lack of communicative ability. For now, we can only guess that she somehow favors Subject 1.

Subject 3, on the other hand, has been getting worse and worse. Despite routine doses of sleep medication, he is still reporting to suffer fits of insomnia and night terrors. Subject 3 has noted on multiple occasions to see a woman's face in his dreams. He describes this person as having pale, jaundiced skin, long, flowing, green, leafy vines for hair and white, glowing eyes. He claims it to be tormenting him; chastising him as a person. As well as this, I have personally noticed how withdrawn Subject 3 has become from others around him, always looking over his shoulder at every little noise and even acting aggressively when approached by others.

Consideration is now being discussed on the decision to cut Subject 3 from the project. In another month's time, the third breeding trial will commence.



**\*\*\***

# Entry 15

In the late hours of the night, Subjects 1 and 3 engaged in a brutal physical altercation. The other subjects evidently attempted to break up the two, but were unsuccessful. In the end, Subject 3 was the only on remaining alive, having murdered the rest. Subject 3 then attempted to make a beeline for the breeding room; to "Hera". An attempt was made by one of the other researchers, being without a security team due to limited funds, to subdue him with a tranquillizer. This resulted in Subject 3 claiming another victim by snapping the man's neck. Subject 3 was finally subdued when he reached "Hera" once again, stopping and immediately screaming for her to "Forgive him" and to "Give him peace". This distraction provided an opening for me to come up behind and subdue him with a tranquillizer of my own.

Subject 3 was immediately removed from the site and steps are being taken to ensure that nothing he has seen or done here is spoken about. At this time, with no living subjects remaining, no viable results, and no more available funds for continued experimentation, steps for the discontinuation of "Project Demigod" are currently in motion. Most of the already skeletal staff have already taken their leave from Monolith site D. Remaining are myself, Dr. Orne, and two of the other physicians on the project.

In two days time, Monolith officials will be coming to remove the equipment and seize all data that was gathered during the duration of "Project Demigod". In conclusion, "Project Demigod" was a failure.



**\*\*\***

# Entry 16

This, as well as any possible notes or recording of these events going forward, will be an unofficial record. It was at around 0130 hours this morning, I and Dr. Orne were awakened by what sounded like wails of pain coming from the breeding room. Upon investigation, we found the source of the sounds to be coming from "Hera" -- despite having no mouth to scream from. Her stomach was extended and she was clutching it as she appeared to writhe in agony.

Her wailing became deafening with each passing second and Me and Dr. Orne were unsure of what to do. We decided to open the breeding chamber she was contained in and attempt to administer any medical aid we could in that moment. We had no surgical supplies and only a limited supply of select drugs; mainly anesthetics and/or morphine. We weren't sure, given her supernatural nature, what kind of effects the drugs might have on her. But, in the end, we took action and administered a small dose of morphine to her.

She jerked violently, flailing her arms wildly around, swiping and clawing at the air like she was fending off a predator, before finally relaxing. A quick check of her vitals confirmed that she was still alive, merely unconscious. Dr. Orne and I both are very curious as to what caused "Hera" so much pain like that. Unfortunately, with the equipment decommissioned and officials arriving in a day's time, we are unable to pursue the matter any further.



**\*\*\***

# Entry 17

Official or otherwise, this will be my last report on "Project Demigod". It was this time, two days ago now that  "Hera" awoke, crying in pain once again. This time was far more painful and her stomach had swelled even bigger in size from the last time. When myself and Dr. Orne attempted to investigate, we were met with a shocking discovery. "Hera" had gone into labor.

Immediately, we fetched a pail of ice and water to keep her hydrated during the delivery process. It was here, however, when another, far stranger phenomenon occurred. While we attempted to aid in the delivery process, Dr. Orne began seizing and clutching at both her stomach and her temples. She  then began screaming that she could hear a voice speaking to her, taunting her, similar to the earlier situation before with Subject 3. This was then followed with "Hera's" body abruptly going motionless, while Dr. Orne then began writhing and flailing, shrieking like "Hera" was.

Dr. Orne underwent this hysteria for almost a full minute before her body seized up, stiffening, with her eyes rolled back into her skull. Her jaw distended and, in a voice I know not at all how to describe, she said to me, "*You, Dr., You did this! You murdered men and children, and now, this woman, and to what end? You wish to bear God unto the world, and you will. You will father a child, born from me, the fruit of your perverted ambition, and he will serve only as a reminder of such. You will look upon him, not with pride, but with grief at what you've done. And the day will come when his memory will be the end of you. A day when this child, your manufactured god, will find who he truly is. He will hear my call in his heart, and will command power against you and all men like you; the likes no man before has ever fathomed, and will raze you all to ash!"*

Upon her speech's conclusion, I heard a sickening crack of bone and squelching sound, followed by something protrude, nearly breaching, from Dr. Orne's stomach. This happened again, this time succeeding in breaching her flesh. What emerged was a tiny, chubby foot, belonging to a newborn infant. It waved frantically at the air. Dr. Orne's convulsing body slowly began to die down until fully relaxing in death. From her stomach, the spawn's hand began trying to free itself and the rest of it from Dr. Orne. For a moment, I simply stared on in terror, before cautiously approaching the body.

Still not yet having developed any muscle strength in its arms, the newborn couldn't free itself the way it evidently wished to. Unaware of any other action to take, I took a pair of sutures and the scalpel and performed a very crude emergency C-section, successfully birthing the child, as well as sealing the deceased Dr. Orne back up with the sutures. The newborn screamed and wailed, taking in it's very first breath.

I looked into the infant's eyes. It had light yellow skin, just as "Hera" had. It also appeared to bear other resemblances to "Hera", such as the eyes and light green hair. The miracle happened; I, Dr. Weston Grier, bore a godlike creature unto the earth. But the question remains, at Just how high a price was my success achieved?

I took the child in my arms and held it for a moment. Suddenly, It fell unconscious and I watched it's skin change complexion from it's original yellow to a more natural shade of olive. It's hair, too, changed to a darky brown. It looked peaceful, resting in my arms. Yet, I felt none of the warmth this feeling should bring. Instead, all I could think of as I watched it sleep were the lives that were senselessly spent, simply for the pursuit of scientific expansion.

It was with this in mind that I made the decision that I would raise the child myself. Taking the child, I seized this file and ran from the facility, where I've presently gone rogue. I have gone through the process to change my name, as well as find a new home, somewhere they'd likely not think to look if/when they do come for me and/or the files. I live now under the name of Gerard Bishop, and the child; I named after my middle name, Joseph.

Admittedly, I fear those dying words:

"...*And the day will come when his memory will be the end of you. A day when this child, your manufactured god, will find who he truly is. He will hear my call in his heart, and will command power against you and all men like you..."*

I worry that, despite my best efforts the raise him with love, something will happen to turn him against me one day when he grows up. What exactly will happen when such a time come, I know not. Nevertheless, as long as I can help it, Joseph will live a peaceful life with me. Everything that has happened, and everything I do now, going forward, is for him, my life's work.




**\*\*\***





I stared for what felt like hours at that page. Then, I flipped back and read and re-read through again. I couldn't believe what I'd just read. No, I *WOULDN'T* believe it.

My father, a brilliant and celebrated scientist, accomplished his greatest achievement by murdering others in the name of science; at least two of which were *children*?! And then, even more horrifically, *I* was that achievement, born and bred out of blood. No, no, I didn't want to admit it was true. but, deep down, I knew it was.

The more I thought back, the more the pieces of a long-unsolved puzzle began falling into place. I now knew why Dad was almost never around. I now understood why it petrified him so much when he found out that I'd been reading those books. I wasn't just his son. I wasn't just his greatest achievement. I was his reminder of the price of pursuing knowledge.

Moreover, I now understood myself; why I was always drawn to the books, the stories, the worls, the characters. And I think that's what he feared most, that I would learn the truth. That was why he sent me away all those years ago, why he never tried to see me or explain any of this to me, himself, and why his life ended the way it did. He feared the truth; that even with the best of intentions, he traveled the long, dark road to Hell.

I write this now because the truth needs it's day. After all, It's what I was born for.

My hands were swollen from gripping the monkey bars and my white dress has been polished by the bark on the floor. A kid everyone at school knew as Russell was pushing others out of the way. He wasn't a big kid, but he had the ferocity of a wolverine. Always getting into trouble, picking fights with even the 5th graders. I've seen him cornered before by two or three of the older boys, but they could never put him down. And that scared some people.

It scared me too as I shouted at him, "I heard your dad beats you and that's why you're being horrible!"

Russell's eyes widened as he dropped the 2nd grader to the floor. From my corner cornea I saw the other kids start backing away as he turned toward me and started walking.

I ran.

Russell didn't run, just kept walking after me. I had gotten pretty far away, off the blacktop, nearing the playground. I kept running past the wall ball, until my hands gripped the rope ladder and my feet pushed me onto the second floor of the jungle gym. I turned and saw Russell still walking toward me. Every step absolute. His eyes staring into mine as he closed the distance between us. I shouted at him from the top. "Just leave me alone!"

He didn't listen, just kept walking. His breathing never changed as his eyes glared at me, gluing me into place. I could feel his thoughts lashing out at me as they twisted and turned in his head, each blink tearing away at me as if I were being undressed.

I watched as he reached the foot of the play area. The large stale tunnels blocking my view. My tongue felt like a lump of lead that I couldn't swallow.

From the top of my fortress I searched for help. A playground monitor, a teacher, I'd even take the lunch lady. But there was no one there. Only Russell and a bunch of 3rd graders screaming and pushing each other as they climbed the castle walls.

I hear a kid screeching angrily from below. It sounded as if he had been pushed. I peered over the edge and all I see is a little boy in blue jean shorts and a striped white tee. He seemed upset as he brushes his palms, the anger and humiliation building on his brow were wiped away as quickly as it came after he looked up. I watched as the boy scampered away, leaving an imprint of his sprawling form in the bark, the edges slowly filling in the void as it tumbled down erasing any evidence that anyone had been there.

Only for Russell to step into its place. His feet drew a halfmoon in the bark as he turned to face me. Reverting his attention back to the beating his balled fists wanted to leave on my face. I screamed when he saw me.

Rushing past the other kids, I slid down the firemen pole and headed for the grassy knoll beyond the fence where the soccer fields lay. I turned my head and saw him walking, quietly, deliberately and with ill intentions in my direction. Not a breath lost.

The ground came rushing up at me. My vision filled with the spikey blades of grass as they tore pieces into the soft undersides of my arms, and into my eyes and nose. I turned over on my back. The air in my lungs felt like smog, and I could feel the onset collapse of my airways constrict my throat as I forced each breath through the narrow passage way that was no thicker than a black coffee straw.

I looked up when his shadow crept on my legs. The sun beating from behind his round shoulders, blinding me as he towered over me. His breathing deep as I searched my pockets for an inhaler. I fumbled the plastic piece as he raised his hand above his head.

Nate pushed him to the ground before I was struck. I recognized the older boy's silhouette. Before I could thank him, Nate was tackled to the ground. My outstretched hand recoiled as I watch his face cave. Nate brought his arms in front but they were tossed away as another blow rained after rain. My arms trembled as I watched Nate's head snap back.

My feet found itself gathering beneath me as I rushed to push Russell off. I tried. My mouth tasted like I had swallowed a jar of rusted pennies as I fell face first into the wet grass, the back of his hand stinging on my cheek. The sprinklers had turned on and were beating the blood from my teeth when I heard Russell growling like a wild animal, his eyes were blotched red as mouthfuls of mud fell out.

Nate had managed to slam Russell's head into the mud. When the younger boy fought back with teeth and nails. Nate slammed it down again and held it there.

That day I learned that it takes less than 3 inches of mud to suffocate someone.

When Russell's mom got to the school, the police had to stop her from strangling Nate. "You killed my son!" She kept screaming. "You killed my baby!"

The officials called it a terrible tragedy. The school lawyers called it self defense and the case never saw a day in court. Due to the circumstances the board of education received more funding from the state to keep this from ever happening again and Russell's mom got a big fat check. It seemed everyone was happy, everyone except Nate.

His girlfriend broke up with him because her parents didn't want her to be dating a killer. Most of his friends stopped coming around too. His parents were poor so they couldn't afford to move. Still, after a few months the district recommended that Nate transfer to a different school. The city would provide the transportation to make it easier, it wasn't easier. Word spread to his new school, and the school after that.

I still got to see him though as Nate lived down the street. Some days after school we would hang out.

That stopped when he got into high school. Nate was nearly a man and I was the silly little girl who lived down the street that remembered a past he wanted to forget. For years I heard him falling in with this crowd and the wrong crowd. As normal people wouldn't want to be his friends. I watched them from down the street, driving by in their cars; I watched them every day, waiting for things to change.

It did when I became a freshman. I had been dating a junior that went to his school, hoping to be taken to a party where Nate would be at. It was the second week of school when some guy with a big house invited people over.

"Are those the parents?"

"Yeah," my boyfriend told me. "Who else do you think bought the alcohol?"

I watched as the woman in her mid 30s cut a line of coke on the quartz countertop.

"She's fucking lit."

I ignored him and walked into the living room. The lights were out except for a strobe flickering against the wall in a corner.

"Want something to drink?"

"Sure."

My boyfriend hurried off as I searched the room until I found him. Nate. He sat on the couch surrounded by some friends. They were seniors but some had tattoos already, even the girls. Everyone was in street clothes and I looked as if I was attending my 8th grade winter formal.

"Hey, get a load of the pageant queen," one of the older girls laughed.

I watched as Nate looked up at me. His eyes adjusting in the dark as he took me in. He pushed the girl on his lap off. For a moment there I saw something different in his eyes when he looked at me. A new way of seeing. That feeling disappeared when he grabbed me by my arm and led me away, "What the hell are you doing here?"

"It's a party."

He started leading me to the front door, "You don't belong here."

"Hey!"

We both turned to see my boyfriend holding two red plastic cups. He put them down on the long runner table in the hall. "You better take your hands off of her."

"And who the fuck are you?" Nate stood in front of me, I hid into his shoulder. I could see the hairs on the back of his neck curl. "You know what? I don't give a fuck. I think you better keep walking."

I watched as my boyfriend looked at us silently.

"You better listen," came a voice coming out of the kitchen. "That's a stone cold killer if you've never seen one." It was one of the boys that was sitting with Nate earlier on the couch. "Killed his first victim before you grew a hair on your nutsack."

"I don't give a fuck who he is," my boyfriend took a step toward us and held out his hand, "Come on, we're leaving."

I shook my head.

My boyfriend took another step towards me and Nate pushed him. The swing came so fast that it looked distorted. Nate's eyebrow split open and I felt his blood splash on my neck. Nate's friend grabbed my ex from behind and wrapped his arms around the shorter boy's neck. I watched as my ex's feet kicked the air before going limp. The friend let go and the body hit the floor. "Whoo!" The older boy shouted. "Didn't stand a chance!"

Nate nodded at his friend before turning me around and pushing me through the front door. The music slammed behind us and the quiet roll of suburbia washed over the wet lawn. I could hear the sprinklers spitting.

"Come on."

"Where are we going?"

"I'm taking you home."

"I don't want to go home."

He turned around, "Where the fuck you going to go then?"

I watched as the young scared man in front of me realized where I wanted to be, where I've always wanted to be. I grabbed his hand with both of mine, and didn't let go. He led me to his car, a restored Chevy Nova with crisp yellow paint that roared off the 4 barreled Rochester beneath the hood. It vibrated my body as we cruised down the street.

A few months later I was pregnant at 14. Nate finished high school and got a job with R&R. The pay was great but the hours were shitty. Though my affectionate man never had me want for anything. But some of Nate's old friend's circled our lives as shadows on the heels of a hyena. I watched them come and go, drinking our beer and eating our food as they pretended to be his friend. One in particular always looked at me funny, it was the boy who had choked out my ex at the party, his name was Roger Clinton, and dear Mr. Clinton had eyes that bore into me.

"I know what you did."

"You're drunk."

"At the party. That was your boyfriend."

"I don't know what you're talking about." We were having a barbeque and the night had fallen on the ice chest sitting outside. I turned to throw the paper plates into a stretch bag hanging off the handle of a door.

"You're drunk," I said rather loudly. Grabbing him from his shirt, smelling the booze dancing on his lips. He reached for a beer on the kitchen counter as I held the collar of his shirt. "Get away from me!"

"You're a piece of work, aren't yah?"

I pulled him closer and put my other hand flat against his chest, "Stop!"

"Roger."

We both turned to see Nate in the doorway. Roger looked back at me and then at Nate. Roger pushed me away and started laughing. He took a swig of his beer and kept laughing. He looked at me and took another drink before walking out the backdoor, still laughing.

When we were left alone in the kitchen, Nate turned to look at me. I pulled my shirt buttons closer together. He didn't say anything but I could see it brooding behind his eyes. Roger was never invited again after that.

"Hello?" I had been sleeping one night when I heard something rustling inside the house. I was 6 months pregnant and Nate was at work. I was hoping that he had come back home early, or maybe he forgot something and needed it to work the line. "Nate?"

I heard laughter.

"Roger?"

I looked down the long hallway, the lights were off and my hands were pressed against the wall, blindly searching for the switch. A man stepped into the hallway, his shoulders nearly filling the frame. And then a gnarled boy with his back hunched and arms that were skinnier than twigs appeared at the man's knee. My legs felt like jelly as they took a step toward me, a car outside drove by and its headlights poured into the windows. I caught a glimpse of the man's face. It was Roger. Except his face was beaten and lumped, he had great big yellow bruises across his cheek and pieces of grass sticking out the side of his head. His left eye was missing but the eyelid was still open. Roger opened his mouth, jaw stretched as globs of mud fell out.

I ran into the bedroom and slammed the door shut. I could hear their feet scraping the ground as they tore the floorboards up after me. The door rattled on its hinges as they slammed against it. I could hear them clawing madly at the wood, and the sounds of their fingernails falling onto the floor. One of the nails clattered beneath the doorway and I could see the long splinters that had worked its way underneath, piercing the top of calcified skin.

I felt something wet between my legs. I looked down in the low light and saw the deep red blood running past my knees. I screamed and cried as I gathered the blankets around my waist, trying to find where the blood was coming from. There was so much blood that the mattress was soaked underneath me, I felt it suction with every struggle. When I looked down between my legs and realized that it was the baby. The door stopped rattling and the house grew still.

I called the ambulance and waited for them to come get me. The firemen arrived first, I could hear their boots beating down the front door. When they got inside they suddenly stopped as they stared at the door.

"Do you think the intruder is still here?"

"I don't know," said one of them.

"Jesus. What the fuck happened to the door?"

"I don't know." I hear the sound of boots coming down the hall. "Ma'am? We received an emergency call. Hello?"

"Help," I cried from behind the door.

"Shit," I heard the other one mutter. "We're coming!"

The firemen broke down the door and I half believed there would be mud hanging from their mouths. But they were normal. Looked normal.

"She's just a girl," the other one whispered.

"Hey, you're going to be okay." The fireman sat down at my bed, "Do you mind if I take a look? To see if there's anything I could do?"

I nodded.

"Jay," the fireman took off his jacket. "You've got to get down here. It's crowning."

I shook my head, "No. I'm not due for another 2 months."

He gave me a grim look. "Jay!"

"Yeah, yeah I got it." Jay took off his jacket and placed it on the floor. He peeled the wet sheets from my legs gingerly. "There's black veins running up her leg. Necrosis. I think."

"We're going to need you to push."

I shook my head again, "My fiancé is going to be here any minute. I called him. Can we wait for him? He's not going to want to miss being here for the birth."

The look on Jay's face was grim, "I don't thi-"

Jay never finished his sentence. Nate came through the door and tackled him down. The fireman hit his head against the edge of the dresser. Blood splattered everywhere. His partner picked up the fire axe and turned it to the blunt end and dropped it onto the back of Nate's head. My fiancé's body crumpled on top of the other man.

"Nate!"

The fireman holding the axe looked at me, "Is that your fiancé? What the hell is he doing attacking us!" He turned Nate over and laid him flat as he started checking Jay's vitals.

"Nate! Please," I begged, "You have to help him!"

When the ambulance and the police arrived everything was chaos. They rushed us to the hospital and started a formal investigation. A detective later produced the idea that Nate must have thought the firemen were my assailants. He had come rushing in to protect me. My lawyer argued that the two public officers weren't properly clothed, which caused confusion and distress. A doctor would later tell me that Nate's frontal cortex was detached by the blow. He could walk and eat, move but not speak. It were as if he had been lobotomized. Nate would need to stay in an institution afterwards.

I attended the funeral of our baby alone. I didn't invite anyone except for the priest who stood next to the football sized coffin as I watched the rains fall from the heavens, turning the ground into mud as each shovelful covered it until the ground went flat.

Most days I visited Nate at the institution. I would brush his hair and read to him quietly. Sometimes I preferred it this way, there was nowhere he could go, and no one else he could talk with. It would just be him and I sitting there quietly, holding hands as I wiped the drool from his mouth. A nurse would come in sometimes to help. She would change him and cloth him, see him naked as she gave him baths when I couldn't. I watched her quietly. Always smiling. Pretty. Her hands touching him.

When she had left the room one day I turned to Nate and asked, "Am I enough for you." He didn't answer me. I looked at him again and asked, "Am I everything you need?" Again, silence. I walked over to the window and saw the nurse wheeling another patient outside. She was older than I was, in her mid 20s. Still young and vibrant. A full figured woman, while I must have looked like a silly little girl standing next to her. "Is that what you like?" Nate didn't answer.

I walked over to him and whispered in his ear, "I think she's trying to get rid of me." I watched his hands curl the steel frame of his chair. "I think she wants to hurt me." I stroked his hair. "You won't let that happen will you? We'll always be together." He pressed his head against my chest, affectionate til the end.

I was fired that morning, which I didn’t know why. My boss just shouted at me from top of his lungs to pack my stuff and when I asked why, he called the security on me. So, I got my stuff in a box and then went to the parking lot. I was very confused, unaware of what is going to happen.

As I put my stuff at the backseat of my car. I noticed a purple, shiny, leather notebook. Even if I knew It didn’t belonged to me; when I picked it up, I saw my name spelled on the metal block with golden colors. I opened the first page and It had all my contact information, address and the bottom of It had my birth day. Only death day was empty but there was a big stain of blood on it.

I was kind of pale for a minute then It came to my mind that these must be a prank from my colleagues. I looked around me and whole parking lot was empty. It wasn’t a moment ago. They couldn’t move all the cars without me noticing right?

I continued to examine the notebook. It was mostly empty but the page 66 wasn’t. It had some stuff written in a language I didn’t know and a headless woman figure was at the bottom of the page. I decided to ignore the figure for a moment and took out my phone to translate the words:

“Come to xxxxxxxxxxx location at this exact moment or we will.” I can’t give you any information about the place after the things I have experienced. I didn’t understood what the person meant with the we will come part but decided not to go. I dumped the notebook into the trash and drove to my home.

I arrived home, sat on the couch and thought about the morning. The more I thought about it, the more paranoid I became. I looked at my phone, I thought about charging it but It had 60% power already. I decided to change into more comfortable clothes and even nap for an hour or so but when I went to my bedroom I saw a headless woman swinging from the ceiling and screamed with absolute horror. I ran to living room, picked my phone to call the police but It only showed out of power symbol. There was no way, It was just 60% a minute ago!

I heard noises from the kitchen. It would be stupid to go there so I ran to the front door and quickly left the home but when I looked around It wasn’t my neighborhood anymore. I looked my behind and It was just an empty street. My small home have disappeared. My heart pumped faster than Usain Bolt. I carefully walked around. From the signs, I understood that I was in xxxxxxxxxxx location. That made me even paler than before.

Then under a second I was surrendered by many dogs. They didn’t looked like natural dogs. They were made of a jiggly black thing. All of them was ready to attack. One of them jumped. Then another! I was almost getting eaten alive! Then a light flashed across them. There was a person was holding a flashlight as all of the dogs melted. I was still in shock. The person held my arm and said “There isn’t much time left. Come on. We gotta leave.”

Both of us started to run. I didn’t know who he was or where are we going but I didn’t had much choice. We came to a house and stopped at the door. Person said “The exit of this place must be inside there. The exit to our reality. We must be careful. There are monsters inside.” I was really confused by him. “Who are you? How are you here? How can trust you?” I asked. He hesitated for a moment. “My name is Xavier. I came here when I was 16… with a friend. We were both expelled from school for no valid reason. We then found strange notebooks on our desks at home. It was mostly empty but the page 64. I decided to ignore what’s written. Then I found my parent’s dead and tried ran away from home. Found myself here. After a while, I found my friend. It was miracle at first. We searched for ways to leave here for years. We discovered how to but my friend died when we were about to. The gate closed before I could leave. For your last question, trusting me is purely your choice but after this night we have to wait for someone else to come for the gate to be open. Very dangerous. We must proceed today."

I still wasn’t sure but decided to go on with him. We entered the house and the door locked behind us. He started to run and I followed him. After a while he stoped and signed me to be quiet. We tried to pass a door quietly but failed and with a "slight" noise of me falling, a monster have been woken up.

“Run!” He said. We tried to be ask fast as we can. Monster was right behind us. I didn’t even see the monster clearly. I was scared to look behind but I could feel it. We ran and ran. Some dogs tried attacking us. Xavier was clever and quick. As we ran, the monster fell behind more. Soon enough we were in-front of a door. As we proceed to it, a zombie-like creature caught Xavier’s foot. Causing him to fall. The day was rising and door slowly started close. Xavier shouted at me “GO! Go for me!” I was terrified. I couldn’t move. Xavier with his last strength jumped on me and pushed me in to the pure white door but the creature caught him back. He couldn’t make it.

I appeared at a random street. Some people looked at me weirdly. I couldn’t believe what happened. It felt real but I couldn't. After all of that, I moved. I changed not only my city but my country. My continent even. I never shared anyone with my exact address. Paranoia took me by day. There was many things that I couldn't understand. Even writing this, the memories made me tremble with fear.

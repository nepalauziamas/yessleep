I was far too drunk to be driving as fast as I was going. Truth be told, I was probably too drunk to even sit in a parked car without all of the windows open, but I had places to be, so I kept the pedal down. Route 50 was light on traffic, maybe because it was December, maybe because it was 3 am. Either way, the few cars I did encounter were easy to pass even though I started to feel like a toddler struggling to stay inside the lines with every swerve.

It was hot for December, so I did have my window down. My headlights were blinking in and out; I’d get them fixed eventually, maybe tomorrow, maybe next month. In that flickering light, I saw a deer sprint out from the trees at the shoulder of the road and then across the highway. Another swerve and another near miss. My heart was in my throat but I felt good, my buzz was still roaring.

There was a bright patch ahead on the highway. My vision was a little blurry but it was clearly a town. My stomach cramped and rumbled. I was *starving*. I saw a speed limit sign on the shoulder for 50 miles per hour. Grinning, I sped up until the needle was pushing seventy-five. Buildings began whipping by me on either side of the Camaro. Blue and fast; I loved my car more than any woman I’d ever met.

There weren’t many people out at 3 am but I tried to at least keep a lookout for cops hidden in alleys. When I saw the Taco Bell approaching on my left, I slammed on the brakes and spun the wheel hard towards the building. There was one bad moment where my fuzzy brain mixed up the pedal and the brake, but I sorted it out and screeched to a halt across a few spaces in the parking lot.

I climbed out of the car and stretched. The drive-thru would have been faster but I desperately needed to take a leak to drain a bladder full of bourbon and Red Bull. The Taco Bell was lit-up with soft white lighting. It looked empty but open. I pushed the glass door and grinned when a little bell rang above me.

My smile dropped as I noticed the two workers behind the counter. The guy was tall, looked to be in his early thirties, and had a busted-up face like he’d just walked in from a fight club behind the restaurant. Nasty purple and yellow bruises covered his cheek, sat under his eyes, and peeked out from his collar. He must have been covered in them under his uniform. The girl next to him was both more and less off-putting. She appeared to be about the same age, much shorter, pretty in a hollow way with her blonde hair and black glasses. There was no visible damage on her but a dark stain soaked the bottom half of her shirt. It was reddish-brown, maybe some kind of sauce.

*Hopefully*, some kind of sauce.

“You okay?” I asked her, walking towards the counter.

The girl didn’t reply, didn’t even look at me. The young dude next to her picked at a shallow cut next to his ear.

“What can I get you?” he asked.

I blinked and tried to shake some of the fermentation from my brain. “Tacos.”

“Yes, sir, this would be the place for that. What kind? How many?”

“Uh. Five chicken. Five beef. One of those crunch wrap things. Nachos. Some cinnamon twists. Oh, and a diet Coke. Oh! And as much diablo sauce as you can give me.”

“Is that all?”

I put a hand on the counter to steady myself. “Yeah. And I need to take a leak.”

“Bathroom’s back there,” the guy said, pointing to a pair of doors in the corner.

I turned away from the counter and took a step towards the restroom then stopped. Now that I had a full view of the dining area, I saw that there were people sitting at one of the tables. They weren’t there when I walked in, I was positive of that. Maybe they entered while I was ordering but…I didn’t hear the bell above the door ring. It was like they just appeared.

I counted three men and a woman, all different ages, all equally awful looking. It was like they were sick, pale and bloodless, with ringed, sleepless eyes. One of the guys had a red-brown stain just like the girl at the counter, only his covered the back of his shirt. They all watched me silently as I walked past them towards the bathroom. I only tripped once. I was pretty proud of that.

While the rest of the Taco Bell was relatively clean and well-lit, the bathroom looked like I might catch a disease just by taking a deep breath. The floor was dirty, the walls were stained, the lights flickered, and it smelled *vile*. One of the two stalls didn’t have a door. The other did but was occupied, a pair of ragged cowboy boots visible under the wall. Whatever. There was an open urinal and that was all I needed. It was disgusting and clogged but I did what I needed to do and went to wash my hands.

While I was cleaning up, I took a look at my reflection in the mirror. It was wrong. I mean, it was me, but my face was as pale as the weirdos in the dining room. There was an angry red cut above my eye on my forehead. I reached up to touch it and felt something prick my finger. I jerked my hand away then went back to probe around gently. There was a small triangle of class sticking in the cut. I pulled it out and dropped it into the sink, hands shaking as I turned on the water.

There was a loud *bang* from behind me. I whirled around in time to see the door of the occupied stall shake. It was like the guy inside was slamming into it.

“You okay, buddy?” I called out, feeling a lot soberer than I had in hours. “Are you-”

The door shook again, louder than before. There was a strange, quiet wailing sound coming out of the stall. It grew to something halfway growl, halfway scream. I turned away, closing my eyes. I must have hit my head at some point, I was imagining things or-

I opened my eyes to find the mirror in front of me completely fogged. As I watched, something invisible dragged against the mirror, drawing a shape or letters in the fog. I didn’t stick around to find out what the message was; I left the bathroom running. Once I burst out of the door, though, I stopped so quickly I tripped. The dining room was full. And the people at the tables and in the booths looked like they’d been dragged out of the local morgue. Men and women, a few teenagers and old folks; they were all in various stages of decomposition. I saw missing limbs, exposed ribs (one so raw I could see a gray sack of unmoving lung through it), cuts and holes and everywhere that red-brown stain.

The interior of the restaurant didn’t look so clean anymore, either. Now it resembled the bathroom with mold in the corners and a thick, white-green fluid in puddles on the floor. Everything reeked. I couldn’t tell if it was the decaying people or the dirty room but the smell was like a physical force scorching my throat and eyes and twisting my stomach.

“Your order, bud,” a voice said behind me.

I turned and saw the guy from the counter carrying a tray full of rotting food. The tacos were covered in a fuzzy mold and the rest of the pile was alive with a squirming knot of glossy white maggots. I slapped the tray and stumbled back, then ran for the door. The little bell from earlier was now just a rusted lump. I pressed against the bar again and again but the door wouldn’t open. The dead things behind me were laughing, soft at first then hysterically as I slammed my shoulder into the glass so hard I bounced off. Their laughter became a buzz like flies over summer roadkill.

“The door’s locked,” I heard the man from the counter say. “You can’t leave.”

“The Hell I can’t,” I growled, standing up.

I felt something grab me and press my face against the glass door.

“***Look***,” a deep voice demanded.

I did. Then I began to sob. In the orange sodium glow of the parking lot lamps, I saw my Camaro. It was destroyed, wrapped halfway around a streetlight. It was no longer a car, only a lump of metal and broken glass. What I saw lying in the parking lot was worse, though. A man, just my size, dressed just like me, crumpled like a doll dropped from up high, soaking in a pool of blood. He…I…had been thrown through the front windshield during the crash. That moment when I accidentally hit the pedal instead of the brake…what if I’d actually kept on the pedal.

“Heck of a way to die,” I heard the counterman whisper. “You shouldn’t drive drunk, buddy; too easy for people to get hurt. Thank God this looks like a one-car crash. A single fatality. Now go grab a uniform from the back. You’re going to be working here for a very, *very* long time”

“No,” I said, pulling back, “this isn’t real. This isn’t fair. I have to leave.”

The man’s grin turned into a snarl. He slapped me, hard and quick, then hit me again, this time with an open fist. I stumbled back into the front door. The short girl that was behind the counter when I came in hit me next; she grabbed at my collar and scratched my neck. Someone else slammed into me from the side and then I was on the ground. Figures crowded over me, dead legs kicking my ribs, stomping me, grinding me into the tile. Blows fell on me like hail on a window. I begged and screamed and whimpered but they kept hitting me. Then, searing agony; the man was pressing his open palm to my chest, burning me, branding me.

Eventually, the dead pulled back. I stood up, bruised and ruined, and decided to take my chance. I ran at the locked door, arms in front of my face to protect my eyes. I jumped and felt the glass break and-

I woke up on the pavement feeling like every bone in my body was broken.

“Hrrrgh,” I groaned, spitting out a tooth.

Someone was standing over me. I flinched when they leaned down.

“Easy, buddy,” a voice said, “I called 9-1-1. They’ll be here soon.”

I blacked out and woke up much later in a hospital bed. The doctors told me I was lucky to be alive after the crash and being ejected through the windshield of my Camaro. My injuries from the accident were severe but non-fatal: a broken arm, four busted ribs, a concussion, two lost teeth and another cracked, as well as every inch of me covered in road burns and deep bruises. Since it was a DUI, I wouldn’t be driving again any time soon and could face fines, maybe even some jail time.

I accept that. Whatever the consequences, I know that I truly am lucky. I escaped Hell.

What I didn’t escape, though, was a permanent reminder of my visit. There’s a puckered red scar on my chest in the shape of a large handprint. The burn aches every day but most of all whenever [a dark thought enters my mind.](https://www.travisbrownwriting.com/)

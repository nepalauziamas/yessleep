I am going by the fake name of Greg. I got a job at "Time Infinity Corp" many years ago after I left the military.
It looks like a small Clock shop. At Time Infinity Corp we have many clocks, big. Small. Medium. Digital clocks. Grandfather clocks.if a type if clock exists it can be bought at Time Infinity Corp.

but this Shop has a dark secret hiding under it.

To understand this secret you must know that time is a physical place.  It is a reality outside reality. And is full of an enargy called "Time Radiation(TR)" Time Infinity Corp was made to study this place. But during a study something happened. This incident is called the "awakening" Time is full of creatures. One of these creatures is called a Time Squid. A giant Squid that is blue and radiates high levels of Time Radiation. The awakening was an incident that involved a Time Squid entering our world and releasing high levels of time Radiation.

 Time Radiation effects organisms in different ways but basically people and animals that come in contact with Time Radiation "change" during the awakening the whole world was covered in 'TR' and many creatures and people and plants and fungi were changed into horrors. Time Infinity Corp's new goal is to find and study these Horrors.

My job involved hunting down the Horrors and catching them and writing reports down about them. I have many stories to share about my hunts but I want to focus on the story of my most recent hunt.

I was sent to investigate a sighting of a "living Skeleton." At a nearby farm with three other hunters. When we got to the farm it was around 12:30am the owners of the farm left after seeing this Skeleton horror so the place was abandoned. We walked around and didn't see anything. We set up camp and put cameras up. It was around 2:40am when a camera went off.

We jumped to action and found a creature eating out of a trash can. We approached with caution. It looked up at us and watched as we walked closer. We were able to get very close to it and we surrounded it. It looked like a human but it walked on all fours and had talons like a bird. And large sharp teeth like a dog. It sat at the trash can and just looked at us. Suddenly it jumped at one of the other hunters. And started to eat him. We had guns so we fired but the bullets did nothing. We tried to pull it off him but it was no use. We had to retreat.
This wasn't the first time a Horror attacked and killed a hunter. But this was the first time a horror killed someone and nothing effected it. 

We called for backup. Backup arrived at 4am. Now we had ten hunters. We had guns, flamethrowers, swords, and other weapons. We approach the trash can where it was and it was still there. The hunter it killed was nothing but blood covered bones. We approach and used the flame throwers to push it back. Nothing. We fired shots at it. Nothing. We used everything we had and it just sat there and watched. Nothing was effecting it. We ran out of bullets. We were going to retreat but it suddenly jumped at another hunter and slashed his throat. It jumped at another hunter and another. We ran and it followed. We got to the Vans and left. We had ten men. Six survived. We are calling this creature the stalker. This was the first unsuccessful hunt I have been apart of. I have been in bad hunts but the bad hunts end with us catching or killing the Horror. This hunt neither happened.

The fact this Horror is still out there is Terrifying. We have sent people to gather info about it form a distance but we haven't got any new info other than the fact it avoids mushrooms at all costs.

I have other stories to tell so I may post an update one day. But that is all for now.

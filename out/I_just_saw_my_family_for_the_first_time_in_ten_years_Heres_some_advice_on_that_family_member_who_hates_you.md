I climbed the brick façade of my family’s ridiculous mansion, grabbing the thinnest crooks and hoisting myself thirty feet above ground, knowing but not caring that a sheer fall would skewer my organs with shards of shattered bone. 

[It didn’t matter that my ailing grandfather was inside, nursing a bloody nose that I had given him](https://redd.it/uzmvzl) after speaking to me for the first time in years. 

As I grabbed the stone gargoyle and vaulted myself onto the roof, I basked in the strength that flowed through parts of me that I’d long given up for dead. Leaping onto the highest point, I slipped the dagger into my pocket and stared through the June gloom to the Pacific, barely visible from where I stood. 

“You will only ever have what you *take*,” croaked the voice inside my head.

I didn’t believe the voice – I *felt* it, and that made all the difference.

“Reach into your pocket and throw the last of it away,” it pressed.

I slipped my hand inside my pants and froze. It was the rest of my meth; I didn’t know when, how, or if I could get more. 

“No one can serve two masters,” the voice pushed.

I doubted.

And then I threw the meth off the roof. I smiled.

The sun wasn’t visible, but I could still feel its presence, even when it was dark.

“Will my grandfather follow me?” I asked the demon in my head as we departed from the ATM.

“Your grandfather is a coward,” he answered. 

I nodded before putting my hand where the meth used to be. I wrinkled my brow. “Where did all this money come from?”

*

“I never knew what a haberdashery was before today,” I told the man as I looked at myself in the mirror. 

He frowned at my reflection.

The demon in my head told me never to reveal my shameful parts to others, and I obeyed.

The man narrowed his eyes. “And how will you be paying for this today, sir?”

“Were you ever told to beware of all enterprises that require new clothes, and not rather a new wearer of clothes?” the demon asked.

“No, Mammon,” I answered, stopping to catch the reflection of myself in a store window. 

I looked good. 

“Why did you say we were going to the bank?”

I walked out of the bank doors with no money in my brand-new suit pockets. “Why are there gaps in my memory?” I asked him. Then I felt a phone in my pocket. I pulled it out to find a brand new iPhone 13, and I forgot about my question. 

“Use the phone to trade your newly purchased stocks online,” explained the voice in my head. “Do it now.”

I stared at the screen. My hands shook; I didn’t know what to do, and he was going to realize that I was a fraud.

“I’m inside of you. I already know what you are, Charlie.”

I shiver ran down my spine and made a home in my nutsack.

“I will tell you what to do if you stop questioning me.”

That’s how I became an incredibly successful day trader. I doubled my earnings by the time that the trading day closed in New York, and then I dabbled in futures.

I stopped. I breathed. “Mammon, did I steal this money from my grandfather?” I whispered.

“Do you hate him?”

I clenched my hands so they wouldn’t shake. “Yes.”

“Do you hate yourself?”

I waited longer this time, and did a worse job of controlling the tremors. “Yes.”

“Then you’re both equally despicable. Is there a reason that he should reap the family’s fortune while you wallow in filth?”

I shook. It had been a long time since my last hit, and even though my clothes betrayed a successful man, they could do nothing to cover my face.

“Balance the crooked scales,” Mammon implored. 

I wiped my eyes and nodded. 

“Hey, mister!”

I snapped my eyes up to see a young boy, maybe eight years old with freckles and a buzzed haircut, running toward me with a look of disgust on his face. I felt at home.

“That’s my parents’ car!”

I looked around to find that I was in a Mercedes-Maybach, but I didn’t know why. It looked good with my suit, though.

“I’m going to tell them you’re stealing it!”

“NO!” I screamed. “No, you can’t do that, it would ruin everything!” I rose from the driver’s side seat.

*THUMP*

I blinked and looked around in the darkness. “Why am I in the middle of Topanga State Park in the middle of the night?” I asked aloud. 

“Are there really gaps in your memory, or are there things you’ve decided not to see?” Mammon asked.

I flicked my lighter, and faces appeared in the darkness. I nearly fell to the ground. Each mouth was frozen open in horror, every set of eyes was unblinking, and not a single one moved. I crawled, trembling as I moved across the dirt, toward the pile of corpses that flickered in the light of my flame.

“Who the fuck are these people?” I gasped. “Why are they dead?”

Silence.

“Please, Mammon,” I gasped. “Tell me.”

“I will only answer you if you answer to no one else.”

The first wave of nausea hit me. “I promise,” I heaved. “You’re the only one who can save me. Please, tell me what you did.”

I couldn’t see his face, but I could hear his smile. “I didn’t do anything, Charles. You have a body, and I have none.”

I wobbled. “But I don’t even know who these people are!” I hissed.

Silence.

With no other option, I faced what was in front of me. I saw freckles and a buzzed haircut, contorted into a look of confused terror.

“No,” I whined. 

I whipped the lighter around, but didn’t see anyone else I recognized.

Wait.

That was the man I’d met at the ATM when no one else was looking. Rigor mortis had already made his scream permanent. He was smashed beneath the loan officer’s wife, who was now room temperature despite my promises to return her safely. The manager at the nearest Apple store knew how to create an account from scratch and connect me to the bank in under ten minutes, but he had no idea how to survive with my knee crushing his skull. The man at his side hadn’t been able to offer me anything but his silence, since he’d witnessed me dragging bodies from the Maybach’s trunk. He lied when promising that silence, so I held him to his word by force.

“Life is unfair for anyone unwilling to take what’s in front of them,” Mammon said.

Tears grappled with the nausea, fighting to melt my face. “I don’t want this,” I blubbered.

“Then why do you smell gasoline?” Mammon answered.

He was right. He was always right. 

I closed my eyes and dropped the lighter. The conflagration threatened to melt the new suit right off my body, but I didn’t care. I wasn’t worthy of feeling whole.

But as much as I hated myself, time passed, and I was still me. I had to deal with the fact that that would never change, no matter how much hate I mustered. “Okay,” I breathed. “I’m answering to no one else.” I wiped my mouth and wiped my eyes. The vomit stung my cornea.

“Get in the car,” Mammon demanded. I hated the fact that his voice comforted me.

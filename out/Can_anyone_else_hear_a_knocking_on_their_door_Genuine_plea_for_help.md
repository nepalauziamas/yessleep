Chloe was my best friend. We’d been inseparable since the age of five; a true, rare, lasting friendship. We attended school together, falling in love and experiencing heartbreak for the first time in tandem. We went to university together and spent a brief stint as crew members in our local McDonald’s. We hated the job but it was just cool to hang out.

Really, if I think about it, Chloe was my platonic soulmate. We were each other’s cheerleaders and were there for every important milestone. I sobbed as her dad walked her up the aisle and she consoled me when me and my husband had to admit defeat and visit a fertility doctor. We shared every love and loss. 

She had three kids. Three, beautiful little cherubs to whom she was the best mother anyone could imagine. And despite my personal struggles with my reproductive system she never made me feel resentful, or jealous or angry or any other negative way.  She included me in her families lives, and I included her in mine.

She was the first person to hold my daughter Cerys, when I bought her home. Cerys was adopted and she knew how much becoming a mother meant to me; so she made sure we came home to a care package, cooked meal and a balloon arch to celebrate. She took family photos I’ll treasure forever, and a video of me and my husband, his arm around me as I’m holding my daughter, that I watch on repeat for hours. 

I watch it for the memory. For that treasured family moment and the intense feelings of joy it brings me. 

*And I watch it to hear Chloe’s voice. The last time I heard her truly happy.* 

I should’ve checked on her more, but I was so wrapped up in the challenges of new parenthood that I could barely see beyond the baby in my arms. For those first two weeks I looked at nothing but Cerys. Chloe and I still spoke on the phone almost daily, but I didn’t notice her subdued tone, didn’t register her anxieties. 

Not until our last call.

Chloe had been complaining about knocks on the door late at night. Her husband worked away a lot and she was home alone with the kids. I’d written it off as local teens out reeking havoc, rushing to get off the subject and tell her the next cute thing Cerys had done. 

I was wrong. 

The last time Chloe called is a blur. Even after repeating the story a thousand times to friends, family and police officers it feels like something I didn’t really experience. It was so out of character for her it was like speaking to someone else. 

It was 11pm. She didn’t text first which is why I knew something was wrong. It wasn’t unusual for us to talk that late, but with the new baby Chloe would always text before she called so she wouldn’t disturb me if I was getting some much needed sleep. I answered to sobs; terrible, guttural sobs that she could barely stifle to speak. 

She told me the knocking had been going on all night. That she was scared and the kids were crying and wouldn’t stop. I asked if she’d looked out the window and she said every time she did the knocking stopped, no one was ever there. She was just as scared of the person at the door as she was of the possibility she was imagining it. 

I’d known her my entire life, and I’d never heard her so frightened. 

I told her to hang up, call the police and call me straight back. I waited for twenty minutes but nothing came, I tried calling her back so many times my phone eventually died. I called the police from my husbands number. They told me they’d had no reports from Chloe’s address but would go and conduct a welfare check. I spent the next hour the most panicked I’d ever felt waiting for the police to update me. 

Chloe’s kids were found alone in her property, with the door open.

Her eldest was six at the time and she said that her mum looked upset, told them she was going to answer the door and never came back. There was no noise, no signs of a struggle, no signs of another person ever having been around the house at all and no signs of Chloe. Most bizarrely, the kids claim they never heard knocking at all, and that they hadn’t been crying like Chloe had claimed on the phone. 

The official line the police took is that she had a breakdown and likely took her own life somewhere and they just haven’t found her yet. 

It’s been four years now. Four dark, dreary, colourless years without my soulmate. I try to embrace every day, celebrating life at every possible occasion with my family but there’s a giant hole. My husband and I are in the process of adopting another child, something I know Chloe would have been cheering me on through had she been here. Every moment is bittersweet. 

It took a while but I accepted it. I’ve run over that night so many times in my own mind that it hurts to even think about, but a detail that had always bought me a twisted comfort was that I never heard the knocking from my end of the phone either. It was easier to accept that she’d had a mental health crisis than something darker having happened. 

It never made any sense. Chloe had always told me everything and I would have known if she were ill. But still, I parroted the same story the police do whenever anyone asked what happened to my friend; as I mentioned, *I was distracted and should’ve checked on her more.* 

Then last week things changed. They changed so dramatically I’m starting to wonder if the police were the right people to contact that night at all. 

My husband has been away since Thursday. He’s at a week long work conference abroad, due back tomorrow and I encouraged him to go. It won’t be long before we have a new baby in the house and I was happy to spend some quality time with Cerys, just mother and daughter. 

But the night he left the knocking started. My heart sunk when I heard the thud late at night but I was determined to continue as normal so I answered. I answered to an empty porch every time for three days before stopping. 

I’ve been through every possible scenario. *Maybe this time it really is just bored teens. Maybe it’s someone I know playing a sick game after what happened to Chloe. Maybe it’s my mind playing tricks on me.*

I’d come to the conclusion that I was feeling especially vulnerable because I was technically expecting, it’s coming up the fifth year without Chloe, and I’m alone with my child like she was. I fought every bad feeling in my body and resigned myself to waiting for my husband to come home. It would all be ok when he got home if I just ignored it.

But now I’m not so sure. That’s why I’m here and not on the phone to the police right now. You guys seem well versed in weird shit. 

Now I’m worried that whatever took Chloe was real. A tangible entity, a dark presence or whatever crazy inconceivable thing you can think of. Who even knows?! Not me, the police or any number of volunteers who searched for her. 

Now I’m starting to think we were all wrong. *So wrong.* Chloe didn’t imagine anything. My mind was never playing tricks on me. It was all real and I know it. 

Because tonight Cerys started crying. She started and she won’t stop. My happy child is sobbing in front of my eyes and nothing I do will calm her down.

And I can’t ignore the knocking much longer.

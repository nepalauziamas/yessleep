“It's me, Anna. I miss you Bunny ” I read, my heart pounding in my chest faster and harder with each word. “I’m not alone right now, He's coming back soon” I frantically reply back “Who, Anna? Who’s with you” I tap the send button and realize my hands are shaking frantically.

“I can’t say, I have to go now, Bye, I love you.” With misty eyes I respond “No! Please tell me where you are” and then her account goes offline

I haven't seen her account online in almost 7 years. “There’s no way” I mutter to myself, I rush to my contacts and call my wife.

“Hon” I say, voice cracking as I struggle not to cry. “She texted me, My love shes alive!” I shout, now unable to hold my tears back. “She called me Bunny, Nobody knew that my sister calls me bunny, Its her” 

My wife seems to share my excitement, Possibly even more off than me, “Oh my good, I'm on my way home now, Were going to the cops” Before she even finished her sentence I’m getting dressed, I took screenshots of the chats, Just incase the sick fuck that took my sister saw that she was messaging me, about 15 minutes later my wife comes home and we rush off to the precinct

I check my watch and realize that it’s later than I thought, 2:21 AM. Doesn't matter to me, After about 5 minutes we’ve made it to the precinct. As I step out the car, I look around and see one cop car parked out front underneath an orange street light that's being swarmed by moths. I walk up to the door of the precinct and pull the handle, beads of sweat drip down my face. I meet a cop who agrees to talk to me, and I show him the messages. He gets an awkward grin on his face and tells me to wait in the lobby.

I don't like the feeling of this place, “How is he the only cop working here tonight” Nevertheless i stay waiting, He comes back and apologizes for the mistake of not grabbing his notepad prior to our first conversation, He sets a bottle of water down, I go to open the bottle and realize its been opened before, I inspect the bottle ever so slightly and realize this water is a bit foggy.

“I guess the water trick didn’t work huh” My eyes shoot up to the cop, Just to be met with the cold metal barrel of a 9mm Pistol. “If you want to see your sister ever again, you're gonna listen to everything I say” He says as I put my hands up, He moves the gun away and handcuffs me, He stands me up and I feel the cold metal of his gun press against my neck as I walk down the stairs near the back of the precinct “Now don't scream, don't yell, don't say a goddamn word” He places the barrel of the gun into my mouth “Or so help me god i'll make sure that's the last thing you, Your wife and your sister hear, Got it?” I nod and he places a bag over my head. About 5 minutes later I hear cries on the right side of me, and I hear a door slam next to me

The cop takes the bag off my head. “Alrighty guys, now that I have you all here, we're gonna have a little family reunion, And at family reunions, we play games!” A sinister grin grows on his face, “How about you start us off big guy” He points to me with a magnum, and opens the cylinder on his gun “We're gonna play my favorite game! Russian Roulette” He spins the cylinder and pulls the trigger, \*Click\*

He groans, And claims that I won, When i feel like I lost. If I have to die here, Let me die before I see both my sister and my wife die, I plead in my head. He walks over to my beloved sister and spins the cylinder again, This time I heard her squeal a bit when he pointed the gun against her head, He raises his arm and bashes her head in with the handle of the magnum once “Didnt i say be quiet, You stupid Bitch!” He then walks over to my wife and I burst out “Wait, play with me again, Please just dont hurt any of them again!” He walks back to me and laughs in my face

“Since you wanna be so concerned about their wellbeing. I'll let you pick”, He fully loads the magnum, Uncuffs me and hands me the gun, He then drags me to the far end of the alleyway, Points the same 9mm i saw with him before and says “I'm bored with this game, you’re gonna choose who dies, and if you don't chose, ill kill you, Then them. You have 15 seconds” My wife pleads to be shot, while my sister pleads to end the pain, Time slows as I wonder what to do, Then a loud shot rings in my ears and my wife’s lifeless body flops to the ground.

“TIMES UP!!” He exclaims, And I drop to my knees in horror, Seeing the woman of my dreams now lifeless, I feel that same 9mm against the back of my head, “Hey, its okay, You'll see her in a minute.” And as he finishes his sentence I feel my body go limp. I fall to the ground, staring at my sister, a puddle of blood forms around my head, as I realize I can't move my eyes, body, anything. He walks over to my sister and executes her as well, picks up my gun, and my world fades to black

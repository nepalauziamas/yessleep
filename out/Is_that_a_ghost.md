This happened yesterday night I went downstairs to get a cup of water and then all of a sudden all the electricity turned on the in house. I was terrified but didn’t know what to do I thought I was just a flash outage. Then I’ll sort the TV turn on the living room I didn’t I think of it too much until it’s started talking to i thought it was me but I didn’t really know. 
I quickly ran back to my bed trying to go to sleep and I would’ve thought was a dream but the thought so realistic I couldn’t stop thinking about it. I follow because my eyes are fell to sleep. When I woke up I didn’t see my parents my sister or my dog I was confused “ would they have left me” I said out loud 
Then someone was adorable I was surprised but still opened it turned out that was my friend Kyle and Nick. The same thing happened to them and they were trying to find people so they could do like in for their parents. First one to Kyles house and there was nothing there when we went to nicks house there was nothing there too and then next thought of going to his moms house it was 3 miles away so it wasn’t really that hard to get to on bikes. How was your road to next moms house we saw something move in the forest wouldn’t know think about much. So we just kept on riding to our destination. I want to have arrived in this house exhaust all over the place has Mom wasn’t there so we decided together loose awesome Kyle stay upstairs me and Nick were downstairs in the basement we found a couple of staff until I stumbled on a Through the watch to turn off in the room but my reflection of the Sun right I could tell that they were a bed a  clothing on the wall.  
I want inside the room to try and find out what there was. On my way to the room i was toys clothes and spare wood on the floor. Some of  the things where in boxes so I didn’t really care about them and kept walking to the room. Nick was looking around for something useful to use later on. When I entered the room I tried to turn on the light but it didn’t work I felt something that was cold and smooth and then the door slammed close. I gave was panicking when I heard buck say “you ok in there” …




All of the sodden I the lights started flashing and I saw something coming at me i got really to fight this thing but when it came up to me I punched it but my hand went through I tried opening the door with my other hand but then the lights stoped flickering and I for jump scared by a ladies with long hair she has pail white skin and a white hospital outfit.
   Then I woke up and started laughing Because I was so relief that is wasn’t real…

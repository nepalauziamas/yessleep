I don't know where else I should post this so here it goes. I found a disc for a game show that doesn't exist.
It was a warm summer day. I was walking back from the store, I passed the post office

 when I saw something on the ground. It was a disc with something written on it ”Great or Grim?” I picked it up wondering who the hell still uses laser discs. Anyways I tossed it in my bag and went home.

I worked for a few hours then I did some research on whatever Great or Grim was, surprisingly there were 0 results for Great or Grim. I put the disc into my laptop but first, I turned on my anti-virus so that if the disc contained a virus I would be protected. I opened it and then saw a screen.
“Great or Grim Season 1 DVD” There were 10 episodes listed. All of them had normal names except for Episode 10, Which was just jumbled up letters and numbers
the letters and numbers kept on changing. There were also previews of the Episodes. the first Episode’s preview showed what appeared to be a Man wearing a grim reaper outfit, it looked terrible like a costume from some bootleg Halloween costume store, he was holding some sort of note and on his left, there was an old 
man, he looked to be in his 70s he also seemed miserable like as if his son was shot right in front of him.

 I took some beer from the Fridge, sat down, and watched the first episode. An annoyingly cheerful theme song played at the opening then the camera slowly zoomed onto the man in the Grim reaper outfit he introduced himself as the grim reaper. I chuckled to myself he probably didn’t say his real name because he knew this show would fail.

 The walls around him were old and crusting it seemed like the producers found an old sound stage and filmed there. He then introduced the man on his left. “This here is Moe,” he said Moe looked confused as if he didn’t remember coming to wherever the fuck this studio was located. 

The man in the Grim reaper costume continued “He is a family man with 3 kids and 2 grandchildren. His wife sadly passed away a month ago, and Moe passed away 2 days ago”

wow this guy is an asshole Moe is not dead. He is right next to him I know he may look a bit dead but that is still a dick move

anyways he continued. “if Moe gets 5 or more questions right he will go to heaven but if he gets 5 or more questions right then He will go to Hell.” “where am I?” Moe asked but The man quickly started his questions “what is the most deadly element in the world?” who would know that ”oh I know Plutonium but where?-” “CORRECT” Grim said cutting off Moe once again. The 3 next questions were more questions
about elements but the fifth question was really strange

 “Do your children love you?” Moe paused “Yes” “Oops you're wrong.” Moe yelled “What? no, they love me” Grim laughed like REALLY laughed he laughed so hard as if you told him the funniest joke in the world. ”They never loved you” Moe looked pissed and tried to punch Grim in the face but his hand went thru his body.

The Room went red super red and Grim said “You aren’t supposed to do that. because of this, you have now earned a penalty, you must now answer this last question if you get it wrong then well you know already what will happen. Last question when did your Childhood dog die.” 

Moe froze “August 3rd, 1950” Grim looked at his card. “wrong it was August 5th, Moe can i tell you something? You, humans, don’t die immediately you don’t die and go to 
heaven or hell immediately it takes a while until you go to one of those dimensions i made that clear were you not paying any attention? I told you that you died 2 days ago are you stupid? Do you have a hole in your brain? oh yeah, you do because you 
were accidentally shot by your neighbor in the back of your head. You have lost the game” 

Moe started crying “Please wait let me get another question please” I recognized this moment, It was the preview scene. And then Moe fell as if the floor beneath him broke.

Then the scene changed into an image of Moe's blood running out of his mouth and eyes and his body ripped apart it also seemed like he was in hell. There were sounds of Moe screaming was so loud that I fell over my chair. 

I couldn’t close the damm window I needed to restart my pc. I'm now unnerved it looked like a real gore image. I think I will watch the other episodes tomorrow the but I think I won’t sleep for a while now

I'm Happy that some of you took the time out
of your busy day to read part 1. I didn't really expect many to and I also wanted to thank those of you that showed concern in the comments. It means the world to me!


With that being said, a lot has happened since my first post.
I apologize that it's taken so long to post an update.
And to the folks, I recommend you read part 1 first. because well, none of this will make much sense to you otherwise.


Okay, here we go.


Around sunset two days ago, three weeks After Bill Higgins visit, I heard the bell above the door while cleaning round the bar with my phone basically glued to my ear, still desperately trying to get ahold of my mom. 


I looked up and to my surprise saw none other than Mr wendigo toe make his way to the bar sporting a shiny new pair of crutches.


He sat down at the stool in front of me with a somewhat sad look on his face. 


"Well, I went to the hospital like I promised." He said with a pause 


"I came back to apologize for my behavior the other night. I was pretty out of it, I also wanted to thank you. The doctors were impressed by how well you patched me up. They said that if it wasn't for you doing so, I would've lost my foot." He added.


"I was happy to help. No need to thank me, I was just doing my part." I said smiling while making him a glass of ice water.


"Audrey, are you aware that there’s only a handful of places like Safe Haven left out there? I'd like to make a donation." He said


"I look forward to passing by here and I'm sure many other individuals in my line of work do as well. Because here,"


He gestured all around him. 


"We're able to come in, be ourselves and relax for a change.

I don't want a lack of money taking away one of the last safe places hunters have to land.

A while back, I saved a wealthy family from a Djinn And boy were they grateful. I can't think of a better use for the cash than to use it to keep the roadhouse doors open longer."


He pulled out an envelope from his back pocket and gestured at me to take it.


"I won't lie, we could use it. Are you sure though? That looks like an awful lot of money."
I said in disbelief.


We do accept donations otherwise we wouldn't be able to keep the place running.
But, never have we been offered such a large amount, at least not that I know of.


"Absolutely, we need places like this." He said.


He slid the envelope across the bar towards me then stood up and headed towards the bathroom.


I grabbed the envelope and stared at the bills inside for a moment.


Then the reality of the exchange sank in and it occurred to me that thanking him for his extremely generous act slipped my mind. The man was pushing the men's restroom door open to enter. 


"THANK YOU!" I yelled, as he disappeared inside.


I crouched and typed in the code for our Safe. It's nothing fancy, just one of those small square ones with a keypad we've never been robbed nor do I think we ever will be. Given the nature of our customers, so it just sits below the cash register. 



As I put the envelope away I heard the bell above the door again. I closed the Safe, stood up and scowled because I wasn't sure exactly what I was looking at.



A strange looking man approached the bar. If I had to guess I'd say he stood somewhere around 6'1 and probably weighed right at 200 pounds, tall and skinny.


He had thick black shoulder length hair that seemed too perfect, as if he was wearing a wig or something.


He wore a rather expensive looking all white suit, save for a crimson red tie which almost camouflaged in with his severely sunburnt, face and hands which were the only parts of his body he didn't have covered in clothing.


He stood in front of me, the bar being between us made me feel a little better. I'm a firm believer of not judging a book by its cover but this guy.. this guy was making my skin crawl.He didn't sit down, he didn't speak. He just stood there, staring at me.


"Welcome to The Safe Haven Roadhouse. Can I get you anything?"

I nervously managed to squeeze out.


Then I began feeling hot from the rising anxiety that this encounter was causing. I could feel as beads of sweat surfaced upon my face.


The man had a blank expression on his badly burnt face for the entire duration of our conversation. In fact, his thin almost non-existent lips were the only thing that I can recall seeing any movement from at all.


"I'm looking for a man, Colter Fray. Rumor has it the owners of this establishment are blood relatives of Mr Fray. can you confirm?"


I can't explain, or maybe it's that I'm just unable to comprehend the way it sounded…


The closest thing that I can think of, to compare hearing it speak would have to be listening to computers read text. Thanks to all the advances in technology they've gotten pretty good at sounding human.
Something is still off about hearing it though, just enough, that we can tell it's not a human. That's kinda what he sounded like.
Like Something trying to sound human.


"I…um…don't know who you're talking about, sorry… I can ask around for you though if you'd like."

I said, trying my damndest to fake a convincing smile.


As soon as I stopped speaking, the  lights began exploding, glass rained down with impossible force turning it in to shrapnel Starting at the back end of the roadhouse,
One after another causing me to jump each time, until the only light left was the one directly above us.
I can honestly say that I have never been more afraid in my entire life.


I know how to field strip any firearm put in front of me. I train in jiu jitsu and boxing regularly.
My mom knows what's out there. 
She's always been a little paranoid that something might follow her home one day. So I insisted that I know how to defend myself. I've been training since I was a little girl but I've never had to use it in a real life situation.


I'm Just Audrey the bartender. I help from the sidelines. Unlike my mom, I have no experience fighting the supernatural head on.


"Don't play games with me girl. Don't ever. Ever think you're capable of that. If you're not a blood relative of the man known as Colter Fray, then I have no need for you."


He took a step forward then something caught his attention that caused him to pause for a moment and turn his gaze towards the bathroom.


The man who went to the restroom earlier, now had his revolver drawn and aimed at whatever the thing was in front of me.


"You've got about five seconds to get out of here before I blow your fuckin' brains out." 
He yelled with authority, then pulled the hammer back with his thumb.


The thing turned toward him, a chill ran down my spine as I witnessed the ghost of a smile appear on Its face.


"Five," It said,

as it began to walk towards him.


"Four," It said.

A shot was fired, the beings head jolted back from the impact but…
It continued to walk forward forward.


"Three," it Said.


"I MEAN IT! STAY, THE FUCK, BACK."
The man said,

right before one of his crutches fell to the floor as he frantically inched backwards.


"Two," it said.


The thing was now only feet away. Five more gunshots rang throughout the building rapidly, all meeting their target but the being was… Still unphased.


"WHAT THE FUCK, ARE YOU!"
The man yelled.


"One," It said.


Then it grabbed the much larger man by the neck. Lifting him off of the ground with what looked to me like little to no effort at all.


"WAIT," I screamed, with tears now streaming down my face.


"You want Colter Fray? I'm his great granddaughter. Let him go and I'll get him here, please I just need time."
I pleaded.


It studied me for a moment then lowered the man but didn't release him.


"At precisely this time next week, 10:02 pm, I will return. If Colter Fray is not present,"


It paused and without breaking eye contact with me, gripped the man's throat.
I… I can still hear the sounds he made… it ripped his esophagus out and tossed it to the side as if it were trash. Seeing that will haunt me for the rest of my days.


"I'll take my time skinning you alive then burn your establishment to the ground with your corpse still inside, have I made myself clear?" 
He said.


"Yes," I said sobbing.


"Good" He said.
While heading towards the exit.
The bell rang as he opened the door to leave.


"Wait," I said. 


"What do you even want with Colter Fray?"


The room was silent for a moment as he pondered whether or not to tell me.


"He escaped Hell, I've been sent to find out how."


And with that, the thing that I now believe was a literal demon from hell was gone. I watched as it walked into the forest across the road and disappeared.


This one was hard to relive in order to share with you guys. I'm not sure what I'm going to do, I have no idea how to find Colter. But this has shined some much needed light on the question of why he hasn't been here to see us.
If he's actively being hunted, the last thing I think he would want is to put mom and I in harm's way.


I'm starting to lose hope on mom ever coming home… I am so far beyond worried about her, I know she'll be pissed if I go looking for her but I don’t think I have much of a choice at this point.  


sorry if I brought you guys down with this one. Things around here have gotten very real very fast and I'm not sure what to do. I'll hopefully be around to update you all soon. 


Stay safe out there guys.

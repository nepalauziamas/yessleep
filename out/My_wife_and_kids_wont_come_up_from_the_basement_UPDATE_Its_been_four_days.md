Hey folks. John here. 

I really wanted to just break down and cry after what happened [yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/nfcao4/my_wife_and_kids_wont_come_up_from_the_basement/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) because I was about 90% sure that my family was gone. 


They went into the dark basement below and they have refused to come back upstairs since Saturday. I’ve tried everything to see what is down there, flashlights, lanterns. But I haven’t gone past the door. I can sense an evil there. And I know it’s taken them. 

In fact I was so upset I did something I probably shouldn’t have, but in a way it’s gotten the ball rolling toward some answers. 

Full disclosure, some alcohol was involved in the decision making. 

After a few drinks I called the one person I thought might have answers to this mess, the real estate agent. 
Truth be told, I felt ashamed that I didn’t think of it sooner. But another reason I wanted to call is because my patience was gone. I demanded an answer when she finally answered the phone. 

“John, John. You need to slow down. You aren’t making sense,” she stuttered. 

Something in her voice told me that she fucking knew and I was too drunk to care about her to let it slide. 

“You need to fucking get over here and explain what the hell I need to do to help my family,” I demanded. 

“All right. All right. I will be there in a couple of hours.” 

I sat at the kitchen table, fidgety and afraid. Every so often I would hear the pitter-patter of bare feet below me. The sound of my children supposedly playing in the basement. Every time I heard them laugh or giggle I nearly lost it. 

In fact right before the agent came I was in a really drunken stupor and started to yell down at the basement, demanding it respond. 

“I don’t know what you want from me, but you need to let my family go. We haven’t done anything to you, do you hear me??” I screamed. 

Of course the basement didn’t respond. It was unnaturally quiet in fact. And that just made me even more upset. 

I stumbled down the steps to the door and slammed my fist against it. “What the fuck do you want??” I shouted louder. 

This time I heard a low scratching noise and nearly jolted from the step as I saw strange lettering burning into the door from the other side. 

It took a moment for the word to form, singed into the old wood permanently like a scar and it made me literally gasp for air. 

Then the doorbell rang. The real estate agent was here. 

I fumbled back upstairs and went to the front door, glaring at her. 

“About fucking time,” I responded as she came in. 

“John…. you’ve been drinking. What the hell is going on? Where is your wife?” she asked nervously. 

“That’s exactly what I have been trying to tell you! They have been in the basement! And now they won’t come up,” I explained. 

She walked over to the stairs and looked down at the door, commenting, “I see that you managed to take the lock off. So what was down there anyway?” 

“I haven’t gone down,” I admitted. 

She gave me a puzzled look. 

“What is that on the door?” 

She walked toward it to get a good look and then asked me, “John… Did you do this?” 

“No. How could I?” I asked. 

She tried the handle but it didn’t budge. The door was stuck shut. 

“And you’re telling me that Audrey and the kids are down there? How long have they been down there??” she asked as she jiggled the handle with no luck. 

I fidgeted with my feet, feeling ashamed and embarrassed and frightened all at once. 
“About four days now.” 

Her eyes widened in alarm and she pulled out her phone and announced, “I’m calling the cops. John, this is unacceptable. It’s negligence! You should have called the fire department by now. How the hell are they getting food and resources down there?” 

She pushed me aside and walked back to the kitchen as she dialed 911. 

Then I heard this low rumble below our feet and a noise from one of the bedrooms. 

“What was that…?” The real estate agent asked. 

Then as she was talking to the operator a shadow appeared from the doorway and I felt immediately cold and empty inside. Standing there in the hallway was my wife. Or at least, it was something that looked exactly like my wife. 

“Oh thank god,” the agent said and added to the operator that it was a false alarm. 

“Is everything all right?” Audrey asked softly. 

I was at a loss for words, watching as my wife walked into the kitchen and stood alongside the sink. 

The agent slid her phone back into her pocket and gave me the stink eye. 

“It would seem that your husband here had the idea that you and your children were in danger… honesty I’m hoping all of this was a great prank at my expense,” she commented dryly. 

Audrey laughed. It didn’t sound like her laugh. I kept still as the agent walked over to her and added, “After this little scare you gave me I think I deserve a drink. You did say you got wine from the cellar correct?” 

“I can get you something,” Audrey answered, walking to the fridge. 

“So what was it that my husband told you was wrong…?” she asked casually. 

“You… you and the kids were locked downstairs. Or something. In the basement. Audrey I heard you down there,” I said softly. 

She poured the wine and smiled at me. It was not the friendly look I knew from her. 

“Well I’m clearly not in the basement now am I? And you believed that nonsense?” she asked the agent, passing her the wine. 

She sipped it and chuckled softly. 

“Well, to be honest I’ve heard a few rumors about this property. It’s been… somewhat difficult to sell. So the story sounded outlandish but I guess I let my imagination get the best of me…” 

“Rumors?” I said, keeping an eye on Audrey. She was watching the agent the way a lion stalks their prey. 

“Where are the children anyway?” Our guest asked. 

“Excuse me?” Audrey said, seeming surprised by the question. 

“I really should be going but before I do, can I at least confirm the children are alright?” the agent said. 

“Oh. Yes. Yes of course,” Audrey said fumbling for something. I saw it just as her fingers curled around the handle and I made a noise. 

“Watch out!!”

But it was too late. She twisted the knife and slammed it straight into the agent’s face. The woman screamed, dropping the wine glass and immediately scrambled to defend herself. 

Audrey was faster. She grabbed the woman’s hair and slammed her into the sink, forcing her under as she started the water. 

“Audrey!!! Audrey, you're going to suffocate her!!” I screamed as I tried to pull her off. 

She pushed me away and then turned on the garbage disposal, a grinding noise filling the air as I heard the woman scream louder and blood begin to splatter out in every direction. My wife didn’t even blink as she kept the woman’s face down until her body had gone limp. 

Finally, when she was sure that the real estate agent was dead she lifted her from the garbage disposal and tossed her to the floor. I did my best to not look at her mangled face. 

Then she dragged the bloodied body toward the basement stairs. 

“Audrey. Audrey, talk to me. What the hell are you doing? Talk to me damn it!” I said trying to stop her. She made a hissing noise and pushed me away from the stairs as she walked down and pushed the door open to the sheer darkness below. 

I tried again to stop her and she scratched me across the face, slamming me against the wall as she dragged the body down the stairs to the basement. 

I listened as I heard the noise of bones breaking and growls from predators fighting over a fresh meal. It sounded so primal, so animalistic. 

Then from the darkness, Audrey stepped out and closed the door, looking down at her blood splattered clothes. 

“What have you done,” I whispered, barely able to find my voice. I was in fear of what she might do to me if I got in her way. 

She blinked; looking confused and surprised by my question. 

“The children were hungry.” 

I clenched my fists. 

“Those… those things down there aren’t our kids…”

I looked at her with hate and anger. “And you are *not* my wife.” 

She made a low hiss. 

“That’s no way to talk to me, John…. and I would be careful with what you think you are going to do next. Ask yourself carefully… how many people are going to get hurt because of your stubbornness?” Audrey snarled. 

“The police will come, they’re going to eventually realize that poor woman went missing. What the fuck do you want from me??” 

She turned toward the door and opened it back before snarling, “I’m not staying up here to argue. I’m going back to be with our family… where you belong too John.” 

“Don’t you fucking walk away!!” I screamed louder. I was shaking. Convinced she would kill me in a second if she could. 

She turned her head and gave me a curious look. 

“The house already told you what it needs… I suggest you start listening to it.” 

Then she disappeared into the darkness and shut the door between us. 

I went to the door, struggling to get it open again. But it would not budge. 

I screamed in frustration as I touched the burnt letters. 

Fuck. I’m such a wreck I forgot to mention what the message was. 

‘More.’ It fucking said. This fucking house wants more. And I think I just gave it exactly what it needed.

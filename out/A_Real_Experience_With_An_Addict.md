I’d like to preface this by saying, this is actually true, this happened to me tonight and I thought I might share it here, this isn’t a dumb hoax or nonfiction story, this is legit

Backstory: My Mother, Younger Sister and I are living with my Mom’s friend. We left our house because my Dad is a meth addict and a drug dealer, I don’t mind sharing that here, but because of this I’ve been struggling with depression, anxiety, and paranoia. I can deal with the depression and anxiety, already have been for years, but the paranoia is new and by far the worst to deal with. I’m constantly looking over my shoulder, seeing people in the corner of my eye, and thinking that every single car I see driving around my neighborhood while I’m on the way to the court is watching me. And I go to the court to play basketball every single day at the same time, 9, once it gets dark. I live in Texas, the DFW specifically, so it’s very hot during summer and I prefer to play at night so it’s cooler. 

Now, for the past two weeks, every night I go there’s been a guy swinging on the swing. This is at a school, so I was on the school court and there is a smaller park about 1,000 feet from the court. But even though it’s so far, I can hear the swing all the way on the court, it’s loud, and what’s more it sounds like screaming, just a super loud high pitched screeching. Needless to say this can be quite jarring when you’re alone at night on the court and struggling with anxiety and paranoia. I decided to see if this dude was okay, my late night basketball is my escapism and I wanted to see if maybe that swing was his, I posted this on my (snapchat) story saying that I was going to talk to the dude and to “wish me luck”, so I bike down, as I do so I guess he saw me because he immediately stopped swinging, got up, and started pacing around with his hands over his ears, I now realize his might have been because I was blasting Tupac from my speaker, (it’s comforting to have the sound so it’s not completely silent at night as I’m biking around) he was careful to avoid me, walking away from the concrete sidewalk I was riding on and up the little hill surrounding the swing set where I wouldn’t be able to go up to him on my bike, I decided against going up to him as him walking away was a clear signal to me he didn’t want to be talked to, so I bike up the sidewalk and back to the benches by the court and make another post jokingly asking why he has to be at my court of all places, at this point the son of the lady we were staying with dms me and tells me that the man is a tweaker and is there almost every night seemingly high off something, and that one time while him and his buddies were down at the park smoking pot he came up and threatened them with a knife. I was the quite relieved that he walked away. I then decided to leave the park, on my way out I decided to take a video of his silhouette on the swing. I was standing recording for about twenty second as I took two ten second videos of him before he got up, he must have saw me because he slowed down the swing, got up, and started running toward me, luckily I was on a bike and quickly sped off, I believe I was quite lucky because had I not been on a bike I believe he would’ve caught up to me very quickly, I biked harder than I ever have until I got back to the place we’re staying at. I then decided to call the non emergency police line. Although they said they can’t do anything because I wasn’t at the place and he probably wasn’t there

I uploaded all the videos mentioned on my personal YouTube account, it’s just my name, Thomas Gill, the pfp is the kid in the airplane from Psychonauts who nonstop rambles, it should stick out among the sea of old people with their family, this isn’t some ploy to draw attention to my YT, the only posts on it are the four related videos. although honestly if it gets enough engagement I would kind of have to take advantage of that because I have always wanted

If Las Vegas is *"America's Playground,"* the rest of Nevada is America's kitty-litter box…and out here, the weirdest turds don't stay buried for long. 

Elvis was already dead when I ran him over. I am absolutely convinced of that, whatever Ralphie Junior says. Even with my shades on, the blazing sun reflecting off of the desert made my eyes hurt, and I thought the white-tassled lump in the road was just another mirage…until my tires bumped over a beer gut and Elvis burst like a ripe strawberry on the deserted highway. 

Of course we stopped right away. I snatched Ralphie Junior’s phone out of his hand before he could upload the gruesome scene to TikTok, then moved to inspect the damage. I was pretty sure I could smell my shoes melting into the pavement. 

At first I was relieved when I saw that the middle-aged Elvis impersonator had been a corpse for a while…but then I started to think about how he must’ve died. A gory rope of intestines led off into the desert behind the guy…

Who knew how long he’d been crawling around, trying to hold his guts in? 

*Or had coyotes got to him?* 

Hmm. *Coyotes…*

“Ralphie, honey…” I began, “Get back in the car…” 

By the time I turned around, it was too late. There were four of them between us and the SUV: grayish-brown, doglike, with bushy tails. Their sunken yellow eyes were hungry. I could see their ribs through patchy fur…

*So why were two of them chewing on the tires, instead of us?* 

I didn’t want to think about the possibility that they were disabling the SUV on purpose. The other two coyotes approached, stopped about ten feet away, and just…*stared at us.* Waiting.

Parched, cracked dirt in every direction. Sulfur-colored cliffs on the horizon. The shoe-melting strip of road. There was absolutely nowhere to run or hide. When the tires finally deflated, all four coyotes began to circle us…

I wondered how much it would hurt to climb a cactus. 

A blood-chilling howl stopped them in their tracks. They snapped their heads toward the source of the sound, which stood beside a dick-shaped rock in the hazy distance. It looked like another coyote, but that was impossible…*because coyotes don’t walk on two legs*. Whatever it was, it yipped and snarled a warning at the four starving beasts in front of me in a language they apparently understood. Looking down the road, I understood why.

A gigantic semi-truck was speeding toward us. Ralphie Junior and I both ran toward it, waving our arms like shipwreck survivors. The driver accelerated…then slowed…then accelerated again…almost like he was afraid to stop. Either that, or no one had taught him how to shift. 

When the eighteen-wheeler skidded to a halt beside us in a cloud of dust, a weatherbeaten guy with a Sam Elliot mustache stuck a shotgun out the window. 

“Democrat or Republican?” he demanded.

“What the fuck does that have to do with anything?” I snapped. “I just want a ride.” 

Sam-Elliot-Mustache-Man thought this over for a minute. “Okay, I guess you folks are human after all. Come on up.” 

“Do you always ask helpless stranded women about their politics?” I asked crossly once Ralphie Junior and I settled into the truck’s cab, “or am I a special case?”

“Naw,” the driver sighed. “Had to make sure you could talk, and that was the first thing that popped into my head. This is a bad stretch of road. There’s some *unnatural things* out here..but they can’t talk. I was just makin’ sure you wasn’t one of ‘em. The other guys would probably say I’m a damn fool for stoppin’ at all. I’m Ted, by the way. Ted Yellowhorse.”

The interior of the cab smelled like nicotine, Royal Pine car freshener, and melted gummy worms–but it was better than being out *there.* 

“Yep, this is a bad stretch of road alright. Even before more folks started disappearin’ a couple months ago. My people call this place *‘The Salted Earth,’* ‘cuz nothing can survive out here. Unless maybe it was already dead to begin with…” As Ted rambled, we passed a dusty abandoned Cadillac with shredded tires and the door hanging open. I figured that had been Elvis’ ride. *Poor guy.* I wondered what had made *his* tires go flat?

“Oh *shit!*” Ted slammed on the brakes and clutched the wheel as we rolled over something spiky and hard. The truck jack-knifed, rolled over, and I felt my son’s pudge slam into the side of my head for the second time in a week. 

After the dust settled–and after I’d wiped Ted’s cigarette ashes out of my hair and shoved his fallen porno mags off of my lap–I realized the predicament we were in. The truck was laying on its side, and I doubted it was going to cheerfully right itself anytime soon. Ted groaned, blood trickling down his scalp…

Outside, about a hundred coyotes howled in victory.

Ted didn’t wake, not even when Ralphie stepped on his face in his hurry to escape. The ice in the spilled 44 oz drink on my door (now the floor) brought back memories of high school friends comforting me while I puked into the toilet. *They rubbed something cold on the back of my neck to snap me out of it…*

“Listen, asshole.” I whispered to Ted as I splashed ice on his neck, “you’re not just gonna bail on us like a minor character in a shitty horror story–*not today!* My son and I have been through enough already, and the last time I shot a shotgun the recoil gave me a black eye. *Get it together!*” 

Ted groaned and opened his eyes. I freed him from his seatbelt and we climbed out into the late afternoon sun.

Broken-down vehicles were all around us. It was almost like being back in New Jersey.

One sedan had a coyote-sized hole in its windshield, the inside splattered with what was left of the passengers. A pickup truck had lost control and slammed into a rock; the half-eaten driver hung out of the window. *Great.*  

“This is a bad stretch of road.” Ted repeated helpfully. In one hand, he held a bloody cloth to his head; in the other, the shotgun. He gave the cliffs a thousand-stare. “There’s a cave up there. We need to make it there before sunset.” 

“*What?!*” I huffed,”That’s like, five miles!” 

“No. Eight. Or you could wait for the coyotes.” 

Slogging across the parched dirt with a waterfall of sweat pouring down my back and flies that felt as big as buzzards biting at my neck, I made a silent promise that if I survived this, I’d remove “loves hiking” from my Tinder bio. *Mother Nature is the biggest bitch of them all,* I thought, as I rolled my ankle and cringed.

“How do you know there’s a cave up there, Mr. Ted?” Ralphie Junior panted. 

“Some of your ancestors massacred some of my ancestors there once. Do you know what a *‘massacre’* is, kid?”

“It’s like…” Ralphie Junior murmured, “like what the coyotes did…” 

“That’s right.” Ted glared. “*Just like the coyotes*.”

The sun was as fat and orange as a pumpkin by the time we reached the bottom of the cliffs. There, at least, was *something like* a trail–even if it was practically vertical. Ralphie Junior was treating the whole thing like a Boy Scout trip, Ted was surprisingly agile for a man who sits in a truck fourteen hours per day, and as for me…I just tried not to look down. 

The mouth of the cave was in sight before Ted was willing to stop. It was at the top of a hollowed-out dent in the cliff, like a big ice-cream spoon had scooped out the yellowed rock around us. 

“You two wait here.” Ted grunted. He was gone for a *looong* time. I shivered as I looked out over the dead land, the strand of wrecked cars–and the dark shapes darting among the rocks and cacti below. One in particular made me grab Ralphie Junior’s hand and lay as flat as I could against the still-warm stone: it was three times the size of the other coyotes, and was walking straight toward us, as casual as a businessman on his way to an early lunch. When it looked at the hollow where we were hiding, its eyes were like two pinpricks of blazing white light–and I knew that it knew. *I’m coming,* those eyes seemed to say, *and there’s nowhere to run.*

“Uh, Ted?” I shouted over my shoulder, “how’s it goin’ up there?”

“Good, but you two need to stay there.” 

“Why?” I was confused.

“As bait.” Ted shouted back.

“*Now wait just a minute–*”

“Look, lady. Do you wanna kill that thing and get out of here or not?”

“Oh hell n–”

*BANG.* 

I threw myself and Ralphie Junior to the ground as the loudest noise I’d ever heard blasted down the scooped out canyon. A coyote that had been about to ambush us lay dead in the brush. Ted, it seemed, knew what he was doing. 

*BANG.* A yelp. Two more coyotes down–

But there stood the largest one, approaching us with its unnatural strides, babbling in that yiping, snarling language to the pack that followed it. 

There was no way Ted had enough ammo for all of them. I closed my eyes, covered my ears, and for a moment felt bad that the last thing Ralphie Junior was going to see was his mom shaking like a fucking bowl of Jell-O. 

Two more shots made me open my eyes. Ted was sliding down the cliff in a cloud of dust, the huge, freakish two-legged coyote was down, and the pack was scattering. 

“It’s not gonna stay put for long!” Ted snapped. “Grab some rocks, anything–weigh it down!”

I didn’t want to get any closer to the dark, pointy-eared body, but I did as I was told. I felt like a cavewoman, creeping up to the thing with a rock in my hand. 

“Is it…” my voice trembled… “is it a *skinwalker?*”

“Seriously, lady?” Ted groaned, “I swear, you people see one weird thing in the desert and suddenly it’s all *‘skinwalker-this!’* and *‘wendigo-that!’...*it’s real disrespectful. Especially when what you’re looking at is a possessed guy in a Fursuit.” Up close, the fur did look pretty artificial. And the nametag (*“Buttercup”*) did a lot for Ted’s case as well. “Given that Las Vegas is only eighty miles away, you shouldn’t even need to ask where the poor fella came from...although I do wonder how he got a demon inside of him. Hurry up with those rocks–” Ted rumbled behind me “–*it’s not done yet!*”

Sure enough, the thing started to writhe on the ground–even with two holes in its chest–and as it yipped and yiffed in that strange language, the coyotes stopped their retreat. One snapped at Ralphie Junior, who swatted it with a stick; another sprung at Ted. He sprawled; the shotgun went flying, and a pointy-eared black shadow rose to block out the last pale light of sunset. 

I grabbed the shotgun–and this time, I paid attention to the recoil. The black-furred thing went down again, and soon all three of us were heaping everything we could onto it to hold it down. Ted disappeared up to the cave, and when he came back, there was a red gas canister in his hand. 

As he soaked and burned the possessed thing beneath the rocks, the coyotes howled.

“That gas can…” I muttered. “You knew how to kill that thing. You knew about the cave. You knew you’d need some people for bait.” Ted turned to me, backlit by our flaming furry barbecue. “You picked us up on purpose. None of this was a coincidence.” 

“Nope,” Ted admitted,  “Sure wasn’t.” Maybe it was just the firelight, but it sure looked to me like there was something wrong with Ted’s shadow. The forearms were too long, the back too bent, the face stretching forward like a muzzle…

“And I’m willing to bet that your name’s not even *‘Ted Yellowhorse. ’*Maybe even that if we opened up the trailer of that truck, we’d find the *real* Ted Yellowhorse lying dead on top of some cartons of baby formula or something.” I re-racked the shotgun. I didn’t know if it had any shells left, but it sure sounded cool. 

I heard a snapping sound. Ted’s hands were contorting into paws. His arms lengthened sickeningly toward the sandstone. The coyotes fell in line behind him.

“*The Salted Earth* was ours long before you people ever climbed down from the trees. *That One* thought it could take over our territory.” His face extended and his canines twisted into a hideous smile. “But we’re a lot older. And a lot smarter. *That One* was drawing too much attention…”

I took a step backwards and shrieked as I felt warm fur against my leg. *We were surrounded.*

“Here’s what you’re going to do for me, Lady. You’re going to fire that shotgun into each of the cars down there, then you’re going to wipe off your prints and put it in the hands of Ted Yellowhorse, who is indeed in the back of the trailer. You’re going to tell the police the story of a kidnapping and a psychotic truck driver. Take your time with the story. Make it *really good.* Because if it isn’t…if you give them any *reason* to disturb our hunting grounds again…”

All the coyotes howled at once. I got the message. 

Ralphie Junior and I are going to crash at a motel while I give my statement to the cops and wait for the SUV to get fixed. After that, we’re back on the road. 

Our destination? Anyplace where there’s no sand.

A lot has happened over the past couple of days. The local police will be on their way here shortly (they said they were going to prep and deploy a team). I explained the full story to them over the phone, and they took a statement. This is sort of strange, but I got the impression that they were expecting my call. They asked all the right questions, and didn’t seem all that surprised..


Since this isn't exactly an emergency (i.e. crime in progress), I should have a bit of time to share the details. I cannot tell you how relieved I am that they're taking this seriously. I should have involved them sooner. I’m typing as fast as I can here. I'll hurry and explain the events that lead up to now. 

------

After my last update at 3:00am the other morning, I was planning to take the kids and get out as quickly as possible. Without hesitating, I went straight for their room to grab them (they share a room). But, they weren’t there. How could that be?


I panicked, and by this point I was running room to room. I went back to mine and Stacy's room to check if Stacy was still there. *She too was gone.*


**The kids were gone. Stacy was gone. Everybody was gone.**


This was looking really bad. I should have taken them sooner. Why didn’t I take them and go as soon as I read the document?


She must have already been gone by the time I got up at 3:00am to look for the note. Did she ever even come to bed that night? How did I not notice? 


I decided it would be safest for me to leave and spend the rest of the night in a hotel. I parked my car across the street in a small shopping plaza, and walked across to the hotel. I hoped that would give me a bit of cover if she went looking for my car. 


*I texted the number back the next morning*


**Me:** *I found the document, and I read it.*


**619-xxx-xxxx:** *That was my mother and I.*


**619-xxx-xxxx:** *Take the kids, get out now. If your wife suspects anything things are going to get bad.*


**Me:** *Stacy took them. I don't know where they went.*


**619-xxx-xxxx:** *What?*


**Me:** *I found the envelope on Monday. Stacy must have found it when I was asleep and took off.*


**619-xxx-xxxx:** *I told you to text me immediately once you had it.*


**619-xxx-xxxx:** *This is really bad. I need you to meet me now. There's a dirt road behind the theater (left side). Drive down it, and I'll be there waiting.*


**I met with her, and we talked. I’m positive she is the real Stacy. This was when I decided it was time to involve the police. I need to find my kids.**


Stacy explained everything in person: She had a stalker in college (in California). The report from my previous post was in fact about her and her mother. Her mother was killed in the accident, but she survived (she was seriously injured though). After the accident she was put into the Witness Protection Program. Her new identity was "Beth." She had a new life and she was living somewhere completely under the radar. Things were going well. She was happy. Or, as happy as she could be, given the circumstances. 


She was even on Facebook - though, she wasn't using her real name, nor was she using a real picture. And of course nobody knew it was actually her. She eventually became “friends” with several old classmates so she could stay somewhat in the loop on how everybody's lives were turning out. She said she was living vicariously through classmates who were dumb enough to accept a friend request from someone they didn't even know. It was a guilty pleasure. This was obviously against the rules of the Witness Protection Program, but she figured it was harmless as long as she just observed and always used fake information.


As our 10-year reunion approached, she saw a Facebook group created for our class that several prior classmates were joining. In a moment of weakness (or stupidity), she said she broke down and sent a friend request to me after seeing that I was in the group (up until then, she made it a point to never look me up for her safety and for mine). Anyway - I guess I was one of the people dumb enough to add someone I didn't know. 


She checked out my profile, and was completely dumbfounded when she saw that I was married... **to her**. That was when she knew she had no choice but to get in contact with me. Even if it meant risking her own life and breaking every rule in the book when it came to the Program. 


She had to do it soon, and it had to be in person. The reunion seemed like the perfect time and place. 


Anyway, the reality is, she doesn't know who my wife is, and neither do I at this point. Nor do we know why she is doing this. Stacy suspects that it may be the same person that stalked her ~10 years ago, which is absolutely terrifying to me. How could I not notice? Did my actual memories of Stacy fade, only to be replaced with the memories of someone else, whom I was convinced was Stacy… making all of this possible?


**Side note... I just got a text from Stacy, as I was typing this:**

**619-xxx-xxxx:** *Steven, I forgot to tell you one last piece. I'm outside the hotel you're staying at. Come outside for a sec and I'll explain.*


**Me:** *How did you know where I was staying?*


**JESUS WHAT IS HAPPENING.** It's the police. They are banging on the door. But **I'm** the one that called them. This is crazy. Not sure what’s going on. It has to be a misunderstanding. Posting this now, just in case.

**UPDATE: **
Hello, Reddit. This is Andrea... or as you probably know me, "Stacy," Steven’s wife. I've been following along myself. Gripping story, huh? That's all it'll ever be. A story.


Steven was the love of my life. We dated as freshmen in college, and I would have done anything for him. Even after Stacy was long gone and off in California not thinking about him, he still talked about her. I knew I'd never have him to myself. She left him! She didn’t want him. **I** was there for him. It wasn’t fair. He eventually broke up with me because he missed Stacy. He wanted to be with her. She didn’t even realize, nor did she care.


So, I did what any reasonable person would do in that situation. I **became** Stacy. You have no idea how easy it was. I found Stacy on Facebook. I went to California and I watched her every move. I laughed like she did. I talked like she did. I **smelled** like she did. After finally mastering all that was Stacy, I knew that still wouldn’t be enough. I went further.


With the right documents, a pretty smile, a bit of cash (and 19 times under the knife) I could have whatever my heart’s desire. America the beautiful.

 
*The procedures were grueling.* But in the end, God was it worth it. 

I digress, back to today’s events. His laptop was open, so I went ahead and took the liberty of picking up where he left off. I had to finish the story so you wouldn't be left wondering what happened. That is, had the story not all been a “delusion.”


When I left the house that night after finding the note, I immediately contacted the local police. I have indeed been lurking, so I told the story just like he told it. I showed them pictures of “us” dating all of the way back to our high school years. Even I’m surprised how easy it was to sell his “delusions” as his concerned wife.


To them, his schizophrenia diagnosis was apparent. “We see it all the time,” they said. The story was incredulous. He was clearly a threat to me, and to our children. 


I told them he would be calling, and I was right. All I had to do was set the stage.


As for Stacy (err.. Beth) well. Unlike the first time she went into hiding, this time she won’t be seen again. Steven is gone. I had him 304’d (involuntarily committed to a mental facility). Serves him right for choosing Stacy over me a second time. Either way…he'll now get the treatment he so desperately needs and deserves.  Only the best for my Steven. 


Anyway, the kids want to go out for ice cream. This is /u/ImJustC0nfused signing off. I guess things weren't so perfect, after all.

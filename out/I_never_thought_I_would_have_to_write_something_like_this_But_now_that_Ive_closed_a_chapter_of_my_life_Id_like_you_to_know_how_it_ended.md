*“Helen?”*

My wife stared down at me, her face inscrutable, as [I trembled on my hands and knees](https://redd.it/ua5fx4).

“He didn’t go easy like you said he would, Helen,” Wilber grunted.

I tried to rise to my knees, but all four limbs were shaking too much. Since my butthole was still so loose from hiding a knife inside of it, I was ninety percent certain that straining myself would result in unexpected loose stool. Not only was that an undignified way to shuffle off my mortal coil, but it stood to reason that such an expulsion would irrevocably eliminate any residual intimidation factor that I’d earned over the course of the night.

“Should I shoot his dick off?” Danny asked, pointing a pistol at my posterior. “*He’s* already done that twice tonight.”

Helen placed a pistol on the desk, folded her arms, and sighed. “You don’t need to shoot his dick off, Danny. He doesn’t use it anyway.”

Wow. That hurt more than any physical pain I’d experienced all night. I opened my mouth to contradict my wife, but found myself unable to form a counterargument. Instead I froze, quivering on my hands and knees, the smell of poop and terror emanating from my pajama pants, and reflected on where my boring life had landed me. I didn’t want to die early; I was horrified by the thought of my lifeless body sealed in a wooden box. I was trying to save myself so that I could escape back into the cubicle that had absorbed nearly two decades of my seventy-eight year expected lifespan.  

I found the courage to rise to my feet, but I still trembled. “Helen,” I croaked in a weak voice, “this was – this was *your* plan? The whole night was designed by you?”

She looked back at me with a swirl of pity, guilt, frustration, and loneliness. “Harold,” she sighed in a voice that was mostly comforting but still condescending, “this goes back much further than just tonight. Sometimes you can’t see what’s right in front of you. As a person who analyzes risk and circumstantial probability, how did you not notice that the broken living room window had all of the glass on the *outside* of the house? You never see what doesn’t fit your world.” Helen closed her eyes. “I’ll always love you.” She opened them again. “But I need to live my life before I die. What makes you happy is very different from what makes me happy.” She stepped forward and placed a gentle hand on my cheek.

I closed my eyes involuntarily at the caress. Her intoxicating scent of cardamom and talcum powder slammed me with a nostalgia so strong that I nearly fell back to my knees. It took several seconds for me to realize that I was actually experiencing anemoia – nostalgia for what never was, because it had ceased to exist before our timid minds were able to make it real. We love it because we’re afraid of our own potential, and happier to imagine its pristine image so far out of reach that it can never be sullied by the baseness of our human touch.

“This guy smells like he shit his pants, and he already killed two of our guys. Will you please just let me invert his colon?”

“Shut the fuck up, Danny,” Wilbur snapped before slapping the smaller man’s skull.

Helen shook her head. “Why didn’t you just accept the life that I set up for you, Harold? $250,000 is more than you needed to be content.”

I felt like my lungs were melting. “You sent the man to pay me off?”

She looked so sad that I forgot to take my next breath. “It was the kindest outcome. You’d be a quarter million dollars richer and could finally let me go.”

I wiped away the first tear I’d formed in two decades. “What makes you think I wanted to let you go?” I whispered.

She wiped away two of her own. “Because you already did, Harold. A long time ago.”

I love risk analysis because it reduces the complexities of existence to numerical data that can be quantified, categorized, and understood. I hate doing it to *myself*, because it take the most important aspects of my life and reduces them to facts that I’d rather not face.

I calculated the probability that Helen was wrong, the chances of my survival, the likelihood of me thriving if I could return to my previous conditions, how those numbers had changed over the past hour, and – for the first time in longer than I could remember – what effect this would have on my wife’s happiness. 

I really, *really* didn’t like what I came to understand in that moment. Looking up into her sad eyes, I wished desperately to tell Helen that she was wrong, that everything was good before all this, and that we could go back to our old lives.

“You’re right,” I breathed, my voice breaking, “and I’m so sorry, Helen. It’s obvious now that our lives diverged a long time ago. I can’t say you did anything wrong by choosing this path.”

She reached out a hand and took mine in hers. We squeezed one another’s fingertips, just like we did on our first date when I was afraid to touch her – not because I didn’t want to, but because I desired it so much.

Then I let her go.

*Then* I grabbed the pistol she’d placed on the table and wheeled around.

Wilbur had just enough time to gasp before I blew a hole in his forehead.

Danny was lifting his gun when I shot his dick off. 

“You like that? *Huh?* It’s all fun and games when you want to do that shit to me, asshole, but now you’re crying and puking and bleeding all over the floor and you’re learning that it’s *not that much fun to get your dick shot off.*”

“Harold!” Helen gasped. 

“Are there any more of your people on site?” I demanded.

Her jaw dropped. “The man who drove you here-”

“Danny was right, I ground his pelvis into Instant Quaker Oatmeal.”

Helen took a step back, eyes darting back and forth between the two men. “No, Harold, you’ve – you’ve killed everyone who came here tonight, everyone except – me.” 

We stared at one another. 

“You’re the boss of this operation?” I asked.

“No – no, it’s Wilbur’s outfit, I’m his number two-”

“Wilbur’s dead, so you’ve just been promoted,” I countered. 

Her eyes grew saucer-wide.

“You’re involved in money laundering, I see. Based on my quarter million dollar payoff, I’m predicting that you must wash about nineteen million a month?”

She stared back, ashen-faced. “Um… close-closer to thirteen million. Harold, you have no idea what you’ve done-”

“I’ve exploited a system with a great deal of weaknesses. Four men are dead because they improperly evaluated a risk threshold that just changed the fundamentals of this operation. You’re balancing your income inappropriately, and are likely losing money via a variety of inefficient decisions. Previous employees seem to have been retained only due to philosophical loyalty, which enhances the echo chamber effect of poor decision-making. You need to hear opposing ideas if you want to keep a clear mind.”

Danny moaned from the floor, so I shot him in the head.

“The bottom line is that you need to hire an experienced risk manager, there’s suddenly an opening in an upper management position of the business that you’re now running, and I’m leaving my boring job in pursuit of something more exciting for the second half of my life.” I folded my hands together and looked my wife in the eye. “You either need to run away and hide from those who might extract revenge, or else take this bull by its horns and seize the leadership that is rightfully yours. The woman I married will grab the bull, and I’m asking for a job as your senior risk management specialist.”

It’s difficult to describe her appearance in that moment; the only thing I can say for certain is that her eyes were blazing as she stepped toward me. I’ll admit that I felt intimidated; Helen didn’t have all of the spry athleticism she possessed in her youth, but she was still in admirable physical shape for a woman her age, and was not to be trifled with when convinced that she was correct about a particular topic of discussion.

She pressed herself against my chest, staring at me with a look of passionate fury.

Then she knocked me to the floor and initiated the most rigorous sexual congress that we had experienced in over a decade. 

“Are there cameras in this warehouse?” I gasped. “Can – is there a risk that someone is watching?”

“Oh *fuck*, I hope so, Harold,” she hissed. Her clothes were half-on and half-off, which was somehow more intriguing than complete nudity, and effectively eliminated all concerns of erectile dysfunction.

This particular carnal meeting featured a host of positions whose existence I had forgotten. Right there on the warehouse floor, I was reminded of reverse cowgirl, spooning, doggy, forward cowgirl, wheelbarrow, inverted eggbeater, upright, nasty salamander, and missionary.

We lay on our backs afterwards, coated in a plethora of bodily fluids, trying to catch our breaths. 

“Okay,” Helen panted. 

“You’re hired.”

Wilbur’s and Danny’s bodies were charred so thoroughly in our house fire that the coroner couldn’t distinguish them from Helen and me. They were lying in our marital beds, after all, so the story of our lives wrapped up simply. The life insurance went to a trust fund owned by a limited liability corporation that Helen had set up in the Cook Islands; since we had no children, all of the payout was transferred overseas.

Our funerals were small affairs. The tale of Harold and Helen Miller wrapped up shortly after, which scared me more than violence ever did.

No one looked for Wilbur or Danny. 

“Helen, we’ve been losing two percent on each cash delivery that Mattagan has been handling. It’s sufficient to avoid superficial suspicion, but is a significant enough statistical aberration to be noteworthy.” I looked over my spectacles at the boss. “If I were a betting man, I’d say that he’s pocketing just enough to avoid detection.”

Helen folded her arms. “I’ve always trusted Mattagan. He doesn’t seem like the type.”

I raised an eyebrow. “Wouldn’t that be part of a brilliant scheme?” I placed my ledger in front of her. “Numbers don’t play favorites, Helen.”

After being held upside down over the Astoria-Megler Bridge, Mattagan confessed to pilfering small amounts over a long con.

And that night, Helen incorporated handcuffs and latex into an unscheduled fornication session. To my surprise, she cited the lack of advance planning as the source of her third climax.

*

Under our leadership, the organization that had been rub by Wilbur grew by 69 percent in the first quarter. Their books were ghastly, to be quite frank. I improved Helen’s numbers in the same way that I had once worked as a corporate drone.

It turns out that I’m much, much more valuable than they’d been paying me.

The end result is that I found my wife by losing her. Everything else in my life – the beige Volvo, my mortgage, a wardrobe with several pieces of the same gray clothing – was forgotten before it went up in flames. It would be food for thought if I ever thought about it.

My life *was* fucking boring. And you know what? It was kind of nice.

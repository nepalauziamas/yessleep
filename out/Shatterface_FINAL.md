[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/uxkgy7/shatterface_part_3/)

"You don't have to come along", I reminded Kylie as I drove the car towards the lake in the woods.

The girl sat next to me, arms crossed in front of her chest and visibly uncomfortable. I couldn't blame her. Our endeavour was somewhere between bizarre and downright terrifying. After all, we wanted to retrieve a ghost's body from the lake her friend had died in while probably attempting this exact same thing.

"Bullshit!", she hissed, staring straight ahead at the road. "I owe this to him."

I didn't think she owed Martin Porter anything like this, not after all the things she had already done since the day we had met at the police station, but I didn't say that out loud. Arguing with Kylie was no use when she was in this mood. I'd rather she stayed with me or she might just do something stupid, like run off to the lake all by herself.

"Just promise you'll be careful."

"Okay, *dad."* She rolled her eyes dramatically.

I didn't respond to that.

I parked the car as close to the lake as I could and, despite acting all annoyed during the ride, Kylie stayed close to me as we crossed the last distance by foot. We didn't talk and in the silence of the forest I allowed myself to doubt our endeavour for a moment. After all, we were chasing a ghost, our actions guided by the words of a ninty-year-old woman whose memory might be rather unreliable.

However, I was still convinced that Shatterface was real. What more proof would I need than the apparitions, the water in my throat last night, the nightmares that aligned with Dolores Fray's story in the most eery way? Not to mention Martin Porter's photographs of the ghost.

The short walk to the lake was nervewrecking. I felt invisible eyes watch my every step and couldn't stop myself from turning my head again and again, though there was nothing to see except the trees. When we finally reached the lake I expected to feel relief, but in reality my anxiety only got worse as soon as I saw the murky water. I knew what I had come  here for – I had known the moment Dolores Fray had talked about the body being left in the lake – but the thought appalled me.

Next to me, Kylie dropped her bag to the ground and took her leather jacket off.

"What are you doing?", I asked. "You're not going in there!"

"Of course I am." She bent down to remove her boots. "I'm a good swimmer. I got this."

Three teenagers were dead already. I wasn't going to add a fourth one. "Absolutely not!"

"You're not stopping me from this", she hissed, stood back up and glared at me. "I'm here for Martin. This is what he wanted to show me, he wanted me to know all of this and now I'm going to finish this for him. Fulfilling his dying wish or whatever the fuck you said I should do, remember? I *owe* this to him." She reached out and grabbed my wrist. "So don't you dare stop me."

That girl was going to be the death of me, I thought. "Don't try to drag her out of the water if you find her", I told her firmly. "Just come back out. As soon as we know she's down there, we'll call my colleagues. Okay?"

Her expression softened as she nodded. "Promise", she confirmed before throwing her arms around my neck and pulling me into a hug. "Thank you, Jon!"

"Just... be careful", was all I said in response.

She smiled, soft and maybe a little sad, then kicked her boots off and walked towards the water while I stood back and watched. Maybe it was stupid what we were doing. Reckless even. But if this was our chance to end all of this – the deaths, the nightmares, the hauntings – then we had to take it. If Shatterface was really the vengeful spirit of Amelia Arden, I wanted to help her find her peace.

Kylie disappeared in the water, leaving behind soft waves that disrupted the surface. I'd lie if I said I wasn't worried about the girl as soon as she stepped into the lake, however I didn't get the time to ponder. For a second I glanced at the ground, where her jacket had been carelessly thrown over her bag, and when I looked back up again, I found myself face to face with Shatterface.

It was the first time I saw her properly and she looked downright terrifying. Long blonde hair hung wet from her head all the way down to her waist, white clothes clung to a frail body. Her face was the same I had seen in my nightmare, a monster's grimace with mismatched eyes seen through a shattered mirror. Some small shards were missing, revealing nothing but a gaping black abyss. Her lipless mouth was twisted in anger, almost as if she tried to bare her crooked teeth like an animal.

The urge to run was almost overwhelming, but I didn't move. I was too afraid she would attack me if I tried to flee now. Instead, I looked into the eyes that seemed unaligned in the broken mirror shards and said carefully: "Amelia?"

She made a noise that could have been a growl, though it sounded choked. And just like that, the spirit was gone and from the lake came an erratic splashing sound. It took a second for me to understand what was happening.

*Not another one,* was my first thought.

*Not her*, was my second.

I wasted no time. Already running towards the lake I threw my jacket off and let myself fall into the murky water, desperate to find Kylie before it was too late. Everything around me was pallid green, airbubbles danced before my eyes. Kylie was easy to find in the small lake, her form strangely dark against the pale water. She was blindly thrashing around, creating even more bubbles and obscuring the already bad vision for both of us.

My lungs were already screaming for air when I grabbed the girl tightly. She struggled against my grip, but wasn't strong enough to rip herself free while I tried to find out which way was up. I knew I had to follow the direction of the rising bubbles, but seeing where they went was almost impossible in all the commotion. I was desperate for air already and for a moment I thought I would drown right then and there, that there was no way I could make it back to the surface in time.

I picked a direction and moved. Kylie had ceased struggling. My lungs burned. Black dots danced before my eyes.

My hands broke the surface first.

As soon as my head was above water I took a deep breath and oxygen flooded my lungs in an almost painful way. Kylie, who was against my worst fears still conscious, coughed and gasped for air as well, her fingers dug into my shoulders as if her life depended on it and I had my arms around her waist, unsure wether she was strong enough to keep herself above water. "Are you alright?", I asked.

"I saw her." Her voice was hoarse. "Not the body. Shatterface. I saw her in the water. I..." A choked sob cut her words off and tears started streaming down her wet face. "I almost drowned!", she blurted out before burying her face against my shoulder and starting to cry properly.

"It's okay. You're alive, Kylie. We're both alive", I reassured her, though I was just as shaken from the encounter. I wanted nothing more than to get out of this damned lake, but for a moment I just held the girl, waiting for her to calm down.

At least Shatterface was nowhere to be seen.

Kylie didn't say another word during our way back to the car. Both of us were soaking wet and freezing now that the sun had already started to set. I turned the heat up as soon as we got into the car and quickly started driving towards my home. Only then she spoke again. "I really saw her, Jon. I'm sure", she told me, eyes focused on the road in front of us, fingers wrapped around the bag she held in her lap.

"I believe you. I saw her too, before I went into the water."

"So... she really tried to kill us?" She drew a shakey breath. "Holy shit."

"I don't think so", I replied honestly. "I mean, she killed so many people and nobody ever lived to tell the tale, right? Why would she fail now? I don't think she wants us dead."

"Then why did she do that?"

I shrugged. Even after all of that, I believed that Shatterface wanted our help, but that made her actions even stranger. "I don't know, Kylie", I admitted.

The rest of the ride remained silent.

Vincent was already home when we arrived, standing in the kitchen and preparing dinner. "Hey, honey", he greeted as cheerful as ever when we entered, then turned around and froze as he saw me and Kylie, completely drenched in water and shivering from the cold. He looked back and forth between us, opened his mouth as if to speak only to close it again and shook his head. "Just... go change. I'll make coffee", he then told us and turned back around.

I gave Kylie an old shirt and sweatpants from myself. "They won't fit, but they're at least dry", I told her with a reassuring smile. "The bathroom is down the hall. Take a hot shower, I don't want you to catch a cold. Towels are in the cupboard next to the sink."

She looked at me in disbelief before casting her eyes downwards, mumbling a thank you and made her way towards the bathroom. I changed into a more comfortable – and, more importantly, dry – outfit as well and then returned to the kitchen, where Vincent pretty much immediately gestured for me to sit at the table. I placed a cup of coffee in front of me and sat down across of me. "Okay, Jon", he started. "What the fuck happened?"

I told him everything, of course. About the nightmares, Shatterface's appearance in our bedroom, Dolores Fray and the story of Amelia Arden, and all that had happed at the lake. He listened carefully as I recounted every detail, shaking his head every now and then but never interrupting me. When I had finished, he stared at me for a while before eventually saying: "I hate you sometimes."

I sighed. "Vincent, I swear this is true..."

"I know!", he interrupted me. "Shatterface is real. Fine, I can accept that. But you massive idiot didn't only risk your own life, but allowed that teenager to risk hers. What the hell were you thinking? At least give a call before you try to get yourself killed so I can come and keep you morons from doing something too stupid. What was I supposed to do if you hadn't come back, hm? Ever thought about that?"

He was right with every word he said and the fact that I hadn't considered all that until now felt like a punch in the face. I shook my head, unable to speak for a moment, before hesitantly reaching out and taking his hand. "I'm sorry", I said, forcing myself to meet his eyes. "I fucked up. I'm sorry."

"Yes, you did", he confirmed with a bitter smile. "I'm just glad you're alright. Both of you." He squeezed my hand. "And if you ever do something like that again, I'll file for divorce."

I chuckled. "That's fair."

"Cool. Now you only have to tell me why we're adopting a teenager."

"We're not..." I sighed. "Her mom's abusive."

"Ah, I see", he replied immediately and nodded. "Okay then. We have a guest room for a reason, right?"

I smiled, happy that he was understanding. Making a mental note to get flowers for him tomorrow, I turned my attention to the coffee in front of me that was slowly getting cold.

A few minutes later, Kylie entered the kitchen. Her pink hair seemed still slightly wet and the clothes I had given her were way too big for her skinny body, but the smudged make-up was gone from her face and her skin had regained some colour. "Hey", she greeted us hesitantly.

"Hey, there you are. Come, sit down, your coffee's getting cold", Vincent told her with a warm smile on his lips. "Jon told me what happened. Are you okay, Kylie?"

She sat down between us and grabbed the cup with both hands, just like she had done in the morning. "I'm fine", she answered, head lowered and eyes focused on the cup. "Uhm... thank you, guys. For the clothes and the coffee and... yeah."

"Don't mention it. So, I just talked to Vincent, you can have the guest room if you want to."

"Seriously?" She looked at me with wide eyes.

"Sure", Vincent answered in my place. "Stay as long as you like."

Kylie didn't reply to that at first. She looked back and forth between us and then simply started to cry, thanking us over and over again between sobs. I could only imagine how her mother treated her to cause such a reaction to basic kindness and I made yet another mental note to take care of this sooner rather then later, but getting her out of there was a problem for another day. Right now, I just focused on comforting her.

The rest of the evening remained uneventful, considering that neither of us wanted to resume our investigation today. In all honesty, I avoided even thinking about that cursed case. I was fully aware that I had to find some other approach, since the lake was obviously not the right way to go, but I decided that this was a problem for another day. A day when nobody had almost died just hours prior.

We spent the evening on the couch, watching TV. Kylie didn't talk much and she was the first to go to bed that night, but I figured she was simply tired from the events of the day. Vincent and I stayed awake for a while longer, neither of us bringing the topic of Shatterface up again.

When we went to bed eventually, I was hoping beyond hope that I'd be spared from any more nightmares. I knew it was unlikely, now that we had apparently angered Shatterface with our actions, but all I wanted after that day were a few hours of peace.

Of course the ghost had no mercy with me.

The first thing I saw was a blurry green void. It was the same scene as last time, an iron grip that held me down, a pointless struggle, cold water burning in my lungs, equally cold terror that came with the realization that I wouldn't make it back to the surface. I didn't wake this time.

The dream shifted to rapidly that it gave me a headache. Actually my entire body hurt when I suddenly found myself standing by the side of the lake, but the pain was worst in my head. My vision was still blurry as I watched some figured drag something white out of the water. They stood around the white thing for a while until they picked the thing up and carried it away.

Another rapid shift and I was on top of a stairwell that led down towards a dim light. My chest was still burning. I could feel the icy water in my lungs. I was angry, so angry that I thought I might burn.

I passed through familiar halls, not walking not flying either, just moving without moving at all. Eventually I ended up in front of a bed with two figures in it and I wanted them to feel the same pain I felt in my chest, but I knew that this was not enough, not nearly enough...

I woke up coughing. Trembling and with a racing heart, I sat up and tried to get all the water out as quickly as possible. The feeling of being watched was terrible, but Shatterface's presence in the room was secondary to the fact that I felt like I was suffocating.

My pathetic coughing woke Vincent soon enough. "Jon?", he asked sleepily. "Shit, are you alright?"

I was just able to breathe again and looked up to notice the silhouette in front of the window when Vincent apparently reached for the lightswitch and the small lamp besides our bed illuminated the room. And there she was, Shatterface, her broken face turned towards the bed. She opened her mouth as if to speak, but any word she might have tried to say was obscured beyond recognition by a wet gurgling sound. She clenched her hands into fists and I felt the water in my throat again, throwing me into another coughing fit.

When I lifted my head again, the ghost was gone. I looked at the slightly greenish water stain on the white blanket and then over to Vincent, whose face had gone very pale. "I saw her, Jon", he said, not quite able to hide the shaking of his voice. "Shatterface... in our bedroom... holy shit, are you okay? Can you breathe?"

"Yeah. I'm fine." My voice was hoarse from all the coughing. "Are you?"

"Yes, just... scared. She didn't do anything. It's just... I mean, I knew you weren't lying, but that... fuck, I haven't seen a ghost before, okay?" He brushed a hand through his hair and took a deep breath.

I nodded quickly, not any less shaken from the encounter than him despite having faced the ghost multiple times already. Still, now that I knew he was alright, I had to focus on something else. The dream, and the revelation that had come with it. "Listen, I know where the body is."

"What?"

"She showed me in a dream. Dolores Fray thought that they left the body in the lake, but they didn't. They brought her home. I saw her standing on a stairway down to the basement, so..."

"So you think her body is in the basement of the Arden Mansion", he finished for me.

"Exactly! Vincent, she's showing me these things for a reason. She wants me to find it. I honestly don't think she'll let me sleep until I do."

"I don't doubt that, Jon", he replied calmer than I had expected. There was silence for a moment, then he pulled the blanket off of himself and climbed out of the bed. "Okay then. Let's go, I know where the mansion is."

Now it was my turn to ask: "What?"

"I grew up here, remember? We played a lot in the woods as kids, stumbled upon it at some point. I remember the way." He shrugged. "I don't know about you, but I'm not going to get any more sleep tonight anyways. Let's go finish this."

"You want to come along?"

"I'm not letting you go alone anymore. And you're certainly not taking Kylie with you. We're not gonna get that girl in danger again."

"Okay." I smiled at him and got out of the bed. "Let's go!"

And so we ended up in the woods in the middle of the night, with only our flashlights to illuminate the path in front of us. Shatterface was somewhere close, observing our every move, I could feel her eyes on us the entire time although I didn't see her. Vincent led the way and I followed closely, holding his hand so we wouldn't get seperated in the dark. The walk through the dark forest was nervewrecking, I silently prayed that we would reach the Arden mansion quickly. I just wanted all of this to be over.

The flashlights didn't cast a lot of light, so I couldn't make out a lot of details when we finally arrived at the mansion. It was obviously abandoned and had been left to rot for a very long time. We had to make our way through an overgrown garden and reached a wooden front door that was tightly locked even after all these years. However, the window nearby was broken and after merely exchanging a look, Vincent and I climbed through the windowframe.

The inside was broken. Most furniture had apparently been removed and the few things that were still around, some lone cabinets and desks, were covered in a thick layer of dust and dirt. A carpet that might have been expensive once was now rotting away. Shards of glass were all over the place. The air smelled of mould.

Now it was my turn to lead the way. Still holding hands with my husband, I tried to find the way to the basement, though that turned out harder than I had anticipated. The dream had been a blur, a hazy recollection of a dead child's memories. We made our way through the ground floor of the building, passing crumbling furniture and rotting carpets, but the stairway to the basement was nowhere to be found.

"Amelia!", I called out, disrupting the absolute silence for the first time. Vincent next to me jumped as I did. "Amelia Arden? Can you show us the basement? Please!"

No immediate answer came. Vincent gave me a look that basically said "what did you expect, moron?" and I just shrugged. We continued our way, hoping we'd find the stairs eventually, when suddenly, I heard a familiar gurgling sound.

I screamed, spun around and found the ghost standing next to a cabinet. Despite my fear, I couldn't stop myself from smiling. She wanted me to be here. I was on the right way.

Then the realization hit. "The door is behind the cabinet", I told Vincent. "They hid the body."

He eyed Shatterface suspiciously, but the ghost vanished soon and he nodded. "That's fucked up", he commented, but didn't hesitate to help me push the heavy cabinet out of the way. Another locked door was revealed soon enough, but the wood was damaged enough that it shattered easily. It swung open and so we stood in front of the stairs leading down into a pitch black abyss. We pointed our flashlights downwards, looked at each other and nodded, then descended down into the basement.

It was an empty room with bare concrete walls, where cobwebs hung from the ceiling and corpses of spiders lay on the floor. The air reeked of decay and I felt sick immediately. We walked further into the room, our steps echoing from the empty walls, and against the wall opposite of the stairs leaned the mummified corpse of a girl, rotten away over the past decades. Her skin was dried out and streched tightly over the bones, remaining strands of hair hung down over the shoulders, discoloured remains of a white dress were stuck to the decayed skin.

Amelia Arden, hidden away by her own parents, had finally been found.

We contemplated calling my colleagues and going the official way, but came to the conclusion that there was no use opening a decades old case. There was no justice to be served. All the responsible people were dead already, killed by Shatterface herself. She'd head her vengeance. Now this was only about peace.

I carried the girls body out of the basement, while Vincent led the way with the flashlight. We brought her outside into the garden Dolores Fray had said she had loved and since we had no shovel we dug a shallow grave for her with our bare hands. Vincent then picked up two twigs and bound them together with some long grass for a makeshift cross which he placed on the grave, finishing our work.

We stood up again and brushed the dirt of as well as we could. "Do you think it's over now?", I asked my husband. "Did we help her?"

Vincent stared off to the side and a smile appeared on his face as he nodded. "Look!", he told me, pointing towards something.

And there she was. Amelia Arden. Not Shatterface, no. Amelia. She approached slowly and I saw that the water had disappeared from her body, leaving her blonde hair in bouncing curles. Her face was still disfigured, of course, but the cracks and missing pieces were gone. She looked human again.

"Jo...na...than..." Her voice was rough and she sounded hesitant, as if she wasn't sure how to speak.

I couldn't help but smile. "Amelia."

The ghost came close. "Thank... you..." She flashed a crooked smile and wrapped her arms around me. It was the weirdest feeling, cold and strangely wet, unpleasant. I forced myself to ignore the instinct to shove her away and just held her for a few seconds before she let go. Still smiling, she turned around and walked away, her body fading as she walked until she disappeared entirely in the first light of the rising morning sun.

Vincent and I looked at each other, both with tears in our eyes. "You did it", he said.

"We did it", I corrected and wiped away the tears. "We did it."

We returned home after that and the sun had risen by the time we arrived. As soon as we entered, however, we were greeted by Kylie, who came running into the hall. "Where the hell were you?", she screamed at us. "Do you have any idea how scared I was when I woke up and you were gone? After what happened with Shatterface? I was worried sick!" She simply hurried towards us and dragged us both into a tight hug. "Don't do that ever again!", she demanded, her body slightly trembling with sobs.

"We won't", I promised the girl. "Everything's okay now."

We told her everything that had happened that night and while she was mad that we had left her behind, she was happy that we had managed to resolve everything. And that was it. I called Vivian the next day and told her to file the deaths of the two teenagers as an accident, so that case was closed after all. I took a few days off work after that night, to recover from all the crazy things that had happened. And, of course, I paid Dolores Fray another visit and told her that Shatterface was free now and that she didn't have to worry anymore.

Kylie is still staying with us for the time being. Vincent and I don't mind. Actually, it's rather nice to have her around. She started working as a secretary in the office where Vincent works – he got her the job – and she's happy to finally earn her own money and get her own place soon. But for now... well, I guess we are like a family.

Internet is an interesting place. You can do many things on it. Games, videos, movies, music...

Homever, there's still bad things on it, like everything.

10 March 2018, the message

It was a normal day, scrolling and messaging my friends. My friend who wasn't speaking for me for days (he was in holiday) messages me this

"Hey, have you seen this website? {link}"

I got confused, I clicked the website, it seemed like a normal website. The website included dark and gothic images, texts, I quickly got scared and closed the website, asking my friend why he did send this. He did not reply.

When my friend came back from holiday, I asked him about this and he said "I did not?".

I was really confused and I was curious, I entered the website with a VPN and started scrolling.

It actually scared me, after I scrolled down, there was gore videos, I wanted to close the website but I was still curious and clicked one of them.

child\_gets\_beaten\_down.mp4

The video begins with a small child walking on the road, a group of people approaches him and starts beating the child, after the child gets heavily injured, they start cutting the childs face to a close-up, after that, they would start cutting his chest and rip his organs off, leaving his lifeless body behind and leave.

I was horrified of this and closed the website, I was traumatized.

Few weeks later, I wanted to view the site again, I was feeling better and was still curious

I scroll down and find different videos, I click one.

tape.mp4

It's a mix tape of creepy stuff, starting from the video child\_gets\_beaten\_down.mp4. The second video is the a HD clip of Ronnie Mcnutt killing himself, seeing this video in HD horrified me but I continued since I was curious. 3G1H and 2G1C videos, the next videos are medical gore of children and babies, which made my stomach unable to handle this and leave again.

I get curious again and view the website again, I see categories:

* ???
* children
* qf

These categories didn't make any sense at all, I clicked qf and the videos there horrified me, filled with animal corpses. It made me wonder who made this website so I started looking around for this, I find a forum post about this website:

"someone sent me a horrifying website, full of gore and illegal stuff, anyone has an idea about whats this?"

It had one reply and it said:

"creepy website, i wonder either"

I started looking around the website and I got a login panel by writing /login.php next to the website

I tried to log on with username as admin and password as admin, I was in admin panel.

The admin panel contained more horrifying videos, which was most likely illegal, I changed the public.html to "stop this shit", after few days, it got changed back to the original form of it, the admin panels password was also changed.

The forum post got new posts about it, complaining about how horrible this website is, few weeks later, the website got closed.

It disgusts me how horrible humans can be to other humans and animals. I still wonder why and who made this website.

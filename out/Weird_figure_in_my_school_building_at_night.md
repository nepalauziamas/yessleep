Earlier today, around 7:30 pm, I was biking past my school. I noticed that the lights on the floor where my art and science class are, were turned on. I was biking on my electric bike, so if something would happen, I would be out of there in no time. I started investigating, when I noticed that in my science class, a weird figure was looking out of the window, directly in to my eyes. It looked as if it had found his prey. I say his because I am confident that it was a male. Not human, though. It was about 7'5, and could easily catch you if you would run. It seemed to not have an facial expression. Staring at it felt like hours going by in seconds. Once I stopped staring, I started getting some chills on my back. I drove off, heading home. I was too scared to look behind me. Once I got home, I started learning for my test, which was upcoming week. Around 9:30 pm, when I was finished, I went down stairs to drink some water. When I wanted to go back up stairs, I looked at my front door. We have this front door, where there is a large glass part in the middle, and I couldn't see anything, but the figure. I dropped my glass of water, and ran up the stairs. I almost tripped over a couple of steps, but made my way to my bedroom. I looked out of the window, desperately trying to see if **it** was still there. It was looming in the dark, barely visable, but again, staring into my eyes. I looked away for one second, looked back, and realised it was gone. No trace whatsoever. 

I just glanced up from my laptop, my room is linked to a balcony, it is small, but a balcony. I watched through the small gap in my blinds, and saw only it's eye. I ran towards the bathroom that was on the same floor, locked the door, and now I am sitting between the toilet and the bathtub. It also makes a sort of sound that only can come from hell, it is so terrifying. But it appears that only I can hear the sound, since I have not heard someone scream from outside. Nor have I heard any cop sirens, or my mother coming home. Maybe I am in a parallel universe, since on my way back home, I didn't saw any pedestrians. That also explains why no one screamed yet. I dont know, maybe my mind is just playing tricks with me. Or this is a really bad dream. I dont know why I am writing this, and if this message will make it through. I really have bad internet right now, it seems that **it** is causing it. I'll give you guys some updates, if I make it out alive. I hope I make it, it is so scary to look at it. See u guys later, I hope I make it out.

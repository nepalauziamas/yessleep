[DECODING…]

This is a formal message from the Intergalactic Federation Commands Team to inform you of the changes made to the intergalactic space travel protocol in accordance with the recent event, now dubbed the Monolithic Vanish.

We ask that operating spacecrafts adjust accordingly as soon as this message is received and we apologize for the haphazard format of this message as we needed to compensate for lost time.

First, some general information regarding the recent event of the sudden vanishing of all stars, plants, moons and all other astronomical bodies and the subsequent appearance of asteroids resembling a monolith of unknown origin in our local supercluster. Our research team have unanimously dubbed this event the “Monolithic Vanish”. Not much is known about these asteroids but rest assured as our research and excursion team are working diligently to unearth their purpose and origin.

Slowly but steadily, our research has progressing and we predict a leap in information when we finally get a deep analysis of the composition of these asteroids. As for what happened to the astronomical bodies that previously painted our supercluster, we are working to understand the circumstances behind their disappearances and will update if any advances are made. With our current information, it seems as though we are unlikely get our beloved home planets back.

For now, we ask that you follow these rules and protocols to ensure your safety while we figure things out.

1.) Never leave your spacecraft unless necessary. We do not know what lies beyond anymore and we may never truly know. So, don’t go looking for answers yourself and leave the work to the scientists at the IF.

1a.) If any crew member attempts to exit the spacecraft without permission, exterminate them

1b.) Common sense but ration your food. If you are running low on supplies, contact the IFTC. Only us spacecrafts are left so don’t bother transmitting on a planetary frequency.

1c.) If your spacecraft manages to get damaged and a spacewalk is absolutely needed to repair equipment, we are sorry but the crew member who goes to fix it should not be allowed back in. Prepare to sacrifice one for the good of many and ensure that the exits are opened for as minimal time as possible.

1d.) If your transportation system stops working and all other backups fail, inform the IFTC and we will send a repair team out to you. Do not attempt to fix it yourself as you may end up travelling somewhere you do not want to go.

2.) Seal all exit compartments and block all the windows. Do not open them unless you are given explicit permission by an IFTC executive you recognise. We know your supervisors and connections, so if it’s a command from an unfamiliar executive, ignore it and immediately report the spacecraft to us.

2b.) Again, any crew member who attempts to exit the spacecraft or look out the windows without permission must be exterminated.

3.) DO NOT APPROACH THE ASTEROIDS. We’ve found that these asteroids have cognitohazardous properties with positive correlations to their size. Symptoms include but are not limited to: Hallucinations, increased violent tendencies, comas, and death. Simply coming into a 3 million km proximity of the smallest asteroids can cause a sudden onset of symptoms. Please avoid these at all costs.

3a.) Asteroids should look like long singular monoliths with a rocky, bumpy surface and whitish-grey colour resembling usual moons or asteroids. These asteroids should be scarce as there are hundreds of light years between each one. They range from a mere kilometre long to the size of several hypergiant stars. Normal asteroids are usually slow moving and still as long as you keep a considerable distance from them.

3b.) Should you notice abnormal asteroids, you should immediately report the co-ordinates to the IFTC and move away from it as much as possible. Though there are certainly more, some abnormalities we’ve noticed are: 
• 2 Asteroids lining up to form an X or a +.
• Discoloured asteroids (we have seen blue, red, and yellow so far).
• Asteroids that seem to be lined with gigantic unknown stalagmites, usually many kilometres tall.
• Asteroids that actively contort and bend seemingly randomly at rapid rates.
• Asteroids with lakes of urea or blood on their surface.
• Asteroids that emit a glow, any glow.
• Asteroids that resemble the shape of a humanoid baby.

4.) This should not happen anyway but in the case of a birth, exterminate and dispose of the child.

5.) As light takes a while to travel, do not be surprised if some stars take a while to disappear. However, if in an area with sparse stars there is one extremely bright star that when scanned appears “unknown” but resembles a neutron star, immediately inform the IFTC.

5a.) If your spacecraft is equipped with the Hermes Model 33X or better, initiate contact with the star while maintaining an appropriate distance. We know, it’s weird talking to a star but they are friendly so long as you are too. We do not know what they are, but we know that they are interested in sentient beings, so answer their questions and you may be spared.

5b.) If you exceed their expectations, they may grant you instant transportation to a nearby IF station. We don’t know how they do this but so far it has not been proven unsafe. For this reason, contact is highly encouraged.

5c.) Do not ask about their origins.

6.) Your ultimate goal as of now should be to reach a nearby IF station. Please try to make it with as many people as possible as more hands on board are always nice to have.

6a.) If nearby, travel to a Zeus Prime model station as we plan on eventually relocating everyone into those stations anyway.

6b.) Try not to use Rubedo warp technology. It will take significantly longer to reach a station but it will be safer. Albedo and Nigredo warp technology are safe to use.

6c.) Avoid decommissioned stations, we do not have decommissioned stations.

7.) Maintain as much contact as often as possible with the IFTC, we will be relaying additional information if we find any so stay vigilant.

7a.) Frequent contact with nearby spacecrafts are also encouraged and should be safe. If any suspicious spacecraft activities arise, report their ship license number and model to the IFTC.

We only have ourselves now in the void of space, so please be kind to each other. Remain patient and may humanity persevere. God help us all.

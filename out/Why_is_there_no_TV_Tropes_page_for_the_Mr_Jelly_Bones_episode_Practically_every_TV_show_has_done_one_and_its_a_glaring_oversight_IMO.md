I know that this might not be the right place to talk about this but I'm not signing up for the TV Tropes forum to complain about something that should obviously be remedied.

Ever since the first Mr. Jelly Bone's episode aired in 97' on *The Angry Beavers*, the trope has been part of the media lexicon. How the other networks get away with it, I have no idea. Maybe he's public domain?

idk. so. If you've ever seen a Mr. Jelly Bone's episode of any show, you probably know the formula, but for those who forgot:

* episode starts as normal, nothing out of the ordinary
* one character will express exclamation of deep dread (poetic license I know but they'll like scream or moan or wail)
* [Mr. Jelly Bone's](https://i.imgur.com/qS0SE72.png) knocks on the door.
* The ensemble talks about Mr. Jelly Bone's, about his smell and how his smell has taste.
* One of the character is compelled to open the door (usually while saying something like "he is come like the hour past; let not mortal quarrels halt us")
* [Mr. Jelly Bone's enters](https://i.imgur.com/0jAXEZb.png). All of the characters bones turn into thin watery gelatin. Their teeth sluice out of their heads while their bodies distort in agony.
* this is always a really good performance from the actors/voice actors and probably why they do these episodes if i'd hazard a guess.
* so once everyone in the main ensemble has had their bones turned to jelly, Mr. Jelly Bone's leaves, wandering through different locations turning everyone's bones into gelatin. 
* Usually at this point it's side characters. Who can forget when it happened on Friends and Gunther was mashed down a sewer grate by out of control cars??? classic lmao
* this is probably intercut with more of the main cast with jellied bones. they're writhing and screaming and their skulls can't hold their brains so they're coming out of their mouths and they're choking on their brains and other internal organs

At this point the episode can go one of two ways. 

* Mr. Jelly Bone's wanders around locations from the show, turning everyone into jelly. In a live action tv show (I think I saw them do it first on 'Just Shoot Me!') it'll break the fourth wall and Mr. Jelly Bone's will walk through the set turning everyone into jelly until the end of the episode.

or...

* Mr. Jelly Bone's [looks](https://i.imgur.com/ZYtvLaG.png) at the screen and starts naming elementary schools across the continental US (never heard him mention any Alaskan schools at least), followed by a recipe for some sort of dough. I've never made it because every episode I've seen where this happens has a different one. I've been interested, though. The one from 'Sesame Street' looks easy enough.

so sorry for the long rambling post :P just trying to get a discussion going about one of the weirdest and most idiosyncratic tropes of late '90s/early 00s TV.

If someone know how to post to TV Tropes can you start a discussion page for this.

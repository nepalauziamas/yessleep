Things are progressing, but slowly. With each new stone that I turn, I’m learning new details. Each a bit more unnerving than the last. In all honesty, I’m beginning to question my own sanity. Maybe I am delusional like many of you suspect – at this point, I couldn’t tell you one way or another. What I do know is that even if I am delusional – this is real *to me*. This is **my** reality - it’s how I am perceiving it. And there is no alternative for me but to face it. So I’ll continue to do just that. 


So, Beth. I started looking into her a little more yesterday per your recommendations. I asked a few people about the “commotion” from the reunion. It lead to plenty of dead ends (this person heard it from someone else, who heard it from someone else, etc). Clearly it wasn’t as big a deal as I had originally thought. It was a reunion, at a bar. Based on what I’ve heard, she wasn’t the only non-reunioner wandering around. And the guest list was a joke. 


Anyway, Jake is the only one that specifically remembers seeing Beth at the reunion. Jake is on the reunion committee. He didn’t come to our high school until senior year, so no idea how he got stuck coordinating the reunion. Anyway, he said she only stayed 15 minutes, and he did not recognize her. He insists that he saw *me* talking to her. So much for his credibility. He was probably drunk.


On another note, I finally heard back from the number yesterday afternoon after being left in suspense for a little over a day. 


**619-xxx-xxxx:** *Why did you run off so fast last night? There’s something I need to talk to you about, and it’s important. Can we talk?*


**Me:** *Hey, what do you mean? Who is this?*


**619-xxx-xxxx:**  *I should have never left you behind. The woman you are married to is not who you think she is. There’s something you need to see.*

 
**Me:** *Stacy?*


**619-xxx-xxxx:** *We went to a movie in 9th grade. You tried to kiss me, and I sneezed. Remember where I was sitting? Go there, and reach under the seat. Text me when you have it.*


**619-xxx-xxxx:**  *Steve – make sure you delete these messages.*


I knew exactly what seat she was talking about, this was one of my favorite stories from when we were younger. Or – from when my wife and I were younger? My wife doesn’t even remember any of this, and she *lived it*. How could **this person** know about it? 


I went right to the theater. Logical me says this was probably a bad idea. It could be a trap. I know that. But I went anyway. Regardless, it was closed by the time I got there.


It would have to wait until Monday, so I headed home for the night. 


*Have you ever had one of those dreams – where you knew you were dreaming, so you intentionally steered yourself toward danger… just to see what would happen? You ran toward the serial killer – or you swam deeper into the water, away from the surface? I feel like I’m living one of those dreams*


As the days progress, this is starting to take a toll on me. Stacy is taking notice. I need to wrap this thing up.
I’m not eating much. I’m feeling somewhat detached. I don’t sleep much anymore. Affection is non-existent. I barely talk to my wife. My wife? 


I took a sleeping pill last night, and went to bed pretty early. 


This morning, my plan was to bail from work a little after lunch to “catch a movie” and get whatever was under that seat. I went to work, went through the motions. 1:00 rolled around and I headed right to the theater. I was starting to feel a bit nervous, now that it was time to actually go through with it. Now that I’ve had more time to think through some of the possible outcomes.  


I scoped it out, grabbed my movie ticket, and got into the theater way early. Luckily, nobody was there yet. I hadn’t been there in years, the theater was clearly updated quite a bit. I went to the same general area where we had sat over a decade ago.  I felt around under a couple seats – aaaand I found it. It was an envelope. 


This was exhilarating, like a scavenger hunt. I couldn’t believe I found it so easily. Part of me wondered if she was watching me at that moment. I felt like she was. Maybe it was just nerves. I couldn’t see anyone else in there.


I didn’t even consider staying for the movie after finding it. Instead, I headed to my car to tear into the envelope. 


**Confidential homicide investigation notes?** Jesus. I uploaded the contents for you to see [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/w35tNUk.jpg). I’m assuming it’ll be pulled down sooner than later, take a look while you can.


I don’t know what to make of any of this.  This is the first time I’ve actually begun to feel like my family could be in real danger. I’m in possession of a confidential document. Sent by someone that I’m not even sure I know. 


I’m obviously not going to text the number back right now, I need to keep looking into this. 


There’s definitely nothing identifiable in this doc, as most dates and names seem to be redacted.


I did some research, and found absolutely nothing online to corroborate any of this either. For all I know, it could be fake. I’m not sure what I expected to find, but I need something. Anything. 


I was a freshmen in college in 2009 – when this appears to have happened. The story itself doesn’t sound even vaguely familiar. It’s obviously confidential so I wouldn’t expect to have heard about it in the media, but it isn’t even anything I heard through the grape vine. I’m going to put more time into researching and connecting dots. I guess I’ll probably text the number at some point. I’ll let you know when I do. 


UPDATE: 2:54am - I CANNOT FIND THE NOTE. THE NOTE IS NOT WHERE I LEFT IT. I haven't been able to sleep much, so I got out of bed to start looking into this more. Last night before bed I tucked the note inside of my work things, and it is no longer there. **SHE KNOWS. I HAVE TO LEAVE.**

I was a really creative kid. I was always drawing, painting, crafting, and writing. I certainly wouldn’t consider myself an artist, but I still enjoy these hobbies as an adult. 

When I was in the 6th grade I started writing a full-blown novel, that I sadly never finished. By the time I eventually stopped writing it was over 350 pages long. My story was about my friends and I. There were about 10 of us of varying ages by a few years, who all lived on the same street and played together nearly every single day. We would play during the day and bounce ideas for the story off each other, and at the end of the day I would go home and write about whatever we’d talked about. 

My story was called “The Shadow Creature” and it began with me and my friend “Pickle” hanging out in our usual spot in the woods directly behind my house, and finding an ancient book in a tree stump. Of course being curious kids, we took the book home and read aloud from it, not realizing we were essentially performing a ritual to welcome this entity into our realm. 

I don’t remember writing anything especially sinister, because these were my friends I was writing about, but the Shadow Creature, as we called it, started causing all kinds of chaos in our lives. My book was a sort of “horror comedy,” as you can imagine coming from an 11 year old. I was adding all sorts of mischief and plot twists throughout the story, but ultimately I knew the book would end by us finding a way to return the Shadow Creature back to wherever it came from. 

This is where problems came along. While I said I don’t remember anything super sinister happening, I do remember making the Shadow Creature kill one of my friend’s dog. I planned to have the dog come back to life at the end of the story, but again, I never made it that far. My friend was livid that I killed her dog in my story and a huge fight broke out within our group, with only one friend really taking my side on things. I guess this was a true AITA moment. It was at this point I stopped writing, and all of my friends and I eventually made up. 

Shortly after I stopped working on my novel, strange things began happening in my house. We had a very long hallway, and I would hear footsteps up and down it all night long. I always felt an incredibly eerie feeling when I was in the hallway, and I started refusing to use the bathroom at night because it sat at the very end of it. We also had an enormous bathroom with a divider wall in the middle. Basically if you were sitting on the toilet you were looking directly at this wall, and on the other side of it was an open linen closet. One time I was using the bathroom and heard a loud thud, and on the other side of the wall all of the towels had been thrown on the floor. 

My parents were pretty religious at the time, and I don’t think they believed me in the beginning because initially I was the only one experiencing anything. Eventually though, we all had some spooky encounters in the house. 

TVs started changing channels on their own. My dad would wake up to knocks on his headboard at the same time every night. Sometimes the taps would randomly run and shut off. The footsteps continued in the hallway, and my cats would stare down it with the hair on their backs raised, hissing, before quickly darting away towards the kitchen. 

This house was originally owned by my grandparents, and when my mamaw died she’d left it to us. We also owned a trailer just two houses down. The house ended up getting some substantial water damage in the back half due to runoff from the hillside behind us. We weren’t very well off and my parents couldn’t really afford to fix the damage, so my parents decided to move back into the trailer. 

During this time, the house sat mostly empty for awhile. We still had some belongings there, and to help ensure that no one broke in to squat or something, we fenced in the front porch as a kennel of sorts and left our dog there. A few times a day I would walk over to the house, usually alone, to feed and play with the dog. I would access the kennel by entering the house through the side door that led into the kitchen, walk past the hallway into the family room, and then out the front door to the kennel. 

One night I went to the house to feed the dog, but on this particular night as I walked past the hallway, I heard those dreaded footsteps. I turned to look, and there it stood, watching me. The Shadow Creature, exactly as I had imagined it in my book. A tall, pitch black figure with no notable features aside from its long arms and fingers. I stopped cold in my tracks before my fight or flight had a chance to kick in, and I slung dog food all over the place before running out the door and all the way back home. Sadly, my dog did not get fed that night and I refused to go back alone after finally seeing this thing in its physical form. 

We ended up selling the house to my dad’s best friend and they put a lot of work into fixing it up. It truly is a beautiful little home now. But even they, all these years later, have all had their own experiences with my Shadow Creature. 

I was recently talking about this with my dad. I’m 26 now, and to this day every nightmare I have takes place in that house, which I find sad because I have so many wonderful memories there with my mamaw. I told my dad I think I accidentally invited that thing in with my story, and how I wondered if things would’ve been different had I finished writing it. All he really had to say was that maybe I had been “too creative” as a child.

"They've seen the lights, Ray."  
"Tell them.. it's.."

That was the only thing I could hear from that broken radio before it died out.

My name is Mike Christensen, i'm 16 years old, and i think i got into something i shouldn't have gotten into.
I'm afraid of what might happen to me, or might happen to my dad, i still don't know anything about him since then.

My father works in the navy. He usually brings us souvenirs whenever he can, but last week he got home earlier than usual, and brought with him a very old looking rusty radio, and i mean very very old, the thing looked ready to crumble at any time. When asked about it he only said that it was a "gift" from a friend. This seemed very odd to us, because for one thing, my dad doesn't have friends, not really. He insists on saying that they're just his colleagues because he can lose any of them at any time, and he never, ever, calls someone a friend. More so, the radio was broken, or so we thought at the time. My sister, being herself, isn't interested at all in some shabby looking radio, but I, on the other hand, love anything that my dad brings, and i'm kind of tech savvy and my dad knows i love getting old devices and fixing them, etc. So I took it, and shrugged off the weird feeling I was getting from this whole ordeal. Something was not right, something feels wrong but i don't know what it is.

The very next day, my dad was called back to work, and he apparently went out while we were sleeping. This was extremely concerning as he usually stays about 3 days at least with us. My mom didn't care as much. She didn't care about him really. Since she suspected he was cheating on her a few years ago, nothing's been the same between the two of them. They still live together with us, but they're just putting up a front, my guess is that both of them already see someone else, but they don't admit it, not in front of us at least.

While I was looking for something in my room, I found a cleverly hidden piece of paper with a few numbers written on it. It had a yellow tint to it and looked in a very bad shape, It said: 782.56, 789.80, 434.23.

I didn't understand anything about this, i knew this was my dad's handwriting, but this was really off. My dad isn't the type to keep hidden notes for us or something, especially something this cryptic as he's a very straightforward person with everyone. I figured it had something to do with the radio he just gave me, the numbers looked like channel numbers to me anyway.

I took the radio and tried messing with it a little bit. It took me some time, it was very old after all, but after some tinkering, I managed to make it work, and I tried entering the numbers to see if something happened. 

The first channel was just static, not a single sound was coming from it. I tried enhancing the signal with a few tricks I found on the internet, but it didn't help, i waited for a while to see if anything happened but there was nothing, so I moved on to the second one.

This time there was a sound; a woman crying. Hysterically crying and sobbing. But again, there was so much static that I could barely hear her pleading to someone, saying "Please.. I won't.. anybody.." before her sound was completely gone.
Not gonna lie this creeped me out, that sounded serious, like someone is actually terrified, her voice was trembling and it sounded like she's begging for her life.

The third one barely had any static, but there was complete silence for about 5 minutes, until I heard him, my dad, speaking to a man who I didn't recognise his voice at all. My dad was saying, "They've seen the lights, Ray. This is it. It's happening."  

And then the man who is apparently called Ray replied, "I know, David, I know." Then there was a sound of something loud collapsing and then, "Tell them.. tell them it's.." and then the sound completely cut off and was replaced by static again. I couldn't make anything of this. I was worried, possibly scared, but I didn't know what to do. I hid the radio and the paper and then i waited, for anything, and then the radio started working on it's own, weird sounds stared coming out of it, and as soon as i touched i got electrified, and then a horrific sound came through it, "i.. coming.. for you"
It sounded like a screech, a deep haunting voice that is still stuck in my head until now.

Two days had gone by and nothing happened again. The radio didn't work anymore, none of the channels worked and we didn't hear anything from dad. I started going out for walks every day to clear my mind and think about this. I was on my way out when I saw it on the TV.

A big headline that said, "BREAKING NEWS: Mystical red lights seen above the Pacific Ocean"

I turned up the volume and the reporter was saying, "At around 39 thousand feet above the Pacific Ocean, a pilot reported seeing these enormous red lights erupting from the ocean and up into the sky. It seems like some sort of electricity storm, but we can't confirm it yet. We're waiting for a comment from the authorities. Stay tuned." 

And then it cut to a video feed taken by a news helicopter. It showed these huge lights and electricity just going everywhere in a certain spot. There were a few ships nearby, and one of them was US Navy.

My heart started beating faster ,my breathing was inconsistent and i was shaking. I was having a panic attack. What is this? What happened, and what does my dad have to do with all of this? 

Around 3 days have passed since I saw this on the news, and I still don't know what to do. Obviously, my mom and sister didn't believe me when I told them. They think it's just a "media hoax" and that I'm lying about my father being involved because apparently "I'm seeking attention from them."

My mom is just the worst, she isn't even interested in finding out what happened to dad! And even my sister is just shrugging everything off.. i feel like i'm losing my mind over this.

I'm writing this to you hoping you guys will believe me, maybe even help me. I need to know what to do from here, how to go on. This is something way bigger than me and i don't know what to do about it..

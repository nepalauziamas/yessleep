As I was snapped all the way to back to 1.5 billion years ago I thought it would be a great chance to learn about the past and how much fame it would give me. No researcher has ever done this before. I would be the first. 

As I landed on the ground it felt mushy almost.

I looked down to see the rotting corpse of a strange looking creature. 

It's jaw was wide open with multiple deep scars across it's skin. It looked terrifying but magnificent.

I quickly took a picture before moving on.

The next area I went to was strange to say the last. There were blue, purple, and pink plants all lined about the area. 

It looked warm and fuzzy but there was something off about this place. That's when I saw it.

An eye staring straight at me from the tree line. It looked almost like the eye of a snake except for the fact that the pupils were blood red. The thing had a tiny strand of dirty hair drooping from the top of it's eyelids.

It saw me stare and ran away. I pursued the area I found it staring from and saw a pool of blood lying right where it was.  

I thought to myself: "What could have damaged that thing so badly"? 

I saw smoke in the distance. I always thought humans had learned about fire millions of years from our time I guess I was wrong. 

I walked to the area slowly as I didn't want anything to hear me. I happened I stepped on something and heard a crack under my feat.

I looked down slowly only to see an eye staring at me. It happened to be the same eye that was eyeing me earlier. 

I jumped it was an entire head and when I stepped on it I fractured it's nose. This thing looked very different compared to the humans of today. It had ears similar to that of a bat and the nose of the hair was long and had bugs roaming all about it. 

I took a picture and approached the smoke. I ducked down and saw feet just standing there, I moved in and and I saw a row of lobbed off feet around the campfire. And sitting in front was another one of those strange humans. 

I thought it was sleeping but then it woke up. That was the moment it ran up to me and stabbed me at least 3 times in the gut. It was about to get me again until a bear looking creature came and stomped on the thing. The monster was at least 4 meters tall.

I ran as fast as I could and hid in a tree with a hole wide a enough to fit 2 people. I lost track of time and fell asleep I was awoken at midnight by the sounds of roaring and cackling. That's when I woke up to see the same fire from earlier burning as bright as ever.

That's when I got a full scope of these humans very different from the head of the one I saw before.

They all had bloodshot red eyes, almost bleeding, they had multiple rows of sharp massive teeth, the most rows I counted was 4. They were 2 meters tall. They had sharp long nails coming out of their fingers. But the thing that horrified me the most was the holes gaping in the middle of their chests. Their hears just hanging and swinging around like a pinyata. 

In the fire was the same 4 meter creature that stepped on the "human" cut to bits and pieces. I watched as they feasted on the massive arms tearing at the flesh as if it was some sort of candy. The moment they saw me was the moment I was transported back to our time. The researchers I was with asked me what I saw and me shook to my core responded: "Demons".

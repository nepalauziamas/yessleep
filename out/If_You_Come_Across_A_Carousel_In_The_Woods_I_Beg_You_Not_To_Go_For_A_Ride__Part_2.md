Ian showed up at my house one night. I hugged him tight. Then I had to know what happened. 

He wasn’t sure how it happened, but he knew what happened, and knew what the carousels were now. 

According to him, the carousels were a trick from Hell. They came up from underground as a way to lure people down into the devil’s playground. 

Ian said he found out when he got taken down there. What the carousel did is by spinning you into a trance and injecting your brain with your negative and hopeless thoughts, it got you to stay on it and then pulled you underground to Hell. 

He said the carousels prey on the hopeless. They can feel it in the air and that’s why they pop up in random places.

A particular piece of Ian’s monologue that he laid on me with wet eyes stuck with me. 

“You know how like a carousel, you always associate it with positive - fairs, carnivals, it’s bright and shiny, but if you look closely nothing’s what it seems. Look at the horses and their crooked, stuck smiles, the mirrored glass, it’s only magical if you like what you see in the reflection, half the lights are always busted and burnt out, and the music. It’s songs written by faceless, nameless people who died eons ago. You know?” Ian explained.  

*Sure, But how did he get out?*

He fought. He got sucked down for a few minutes, but he kept fighting the hopeless and negative thoughts and was able to pull himself out.

*I’m not sure if I believed him. He certainly seemed hopeless and negative sitting on the floor of my apartment.* 

Something was off about Ian. He wasn’t himself anymore. He seemed high. Like he wasn’t really there. 

I changed the subject and just talked to him about life for the rest of the night. I got the feeling I might never see him again. He looked weak. Like he could barely keep himself upright. I could hardly look at him. 

I reminded him that night he left his Playstation there last time he was over, hoping he might stop and play. He gave me the weakest hug I have ever felt and walked out without his game console.

A few months later, a carousel was spotted not far from my home. I jetted out there as fast as I could. I found the carousel out on the edge of some rocks on a lonely beach, calling to me at dusk. 

I ended up on the carousel. I can hardly even remember doing it.

The carousel spun me and I felt my brain slip into that familiar trance. I started thinking about that day when it took my mom.

I felt my body become weightless. I saw the world around me spin into nothing but darkness. 

I felt everything around me plummet. I could only feel air all around me. 

Then I heard a familiar voice I hadn’t heard in a lifetime - *my mom’s soft drawl, coming out of the ether.* 

“Where did you go?” 

The world around me turned to light and a setting started to come into focus. I heard the sound of crickets back my mom’s voice as I was nearly blinded by the incoming light. 

“Will you come home?” 

The world came back into focus when my mom finished her question - we were back in that field where the carousel had been, but no carousel. 

I wanted to jump into her arms. I was also very wary. *What if Ian was right? Was this some kind of sinister trick - the devil’s charade.* 

I felt her hold onto my hand and I watched the world all around us start to morph again - starting to swirl and move around in circles like we were on the carousel again. 

Time passed. I couldn’t tell if it was five seconds or 5 hours. I felt a rush and got my breath back.

*I was back on the carousel.* 

I looked to the mirrored wall to my left and saw myself, four years old again, perched up on that white horse.

Then I looked to my right and saw my mom standing out there in the field - wearing the same dress she was that day.

The next move was obvious. I got off of the carousel and walked into my mom’s waiting arms.

Now you’re probably wondering where I was at this point.

I existed at the age of four, but I had the wisdom and mental capabilities of someone who had lived for 29 years already. Everyone thought I was a genius.

Yet, I felt I couldn’t stay. It didn’t feel right. I feel like a visitor. I was living in the past. I didn’t even have the internet. 

After a few months, I had to go.

I felt my mom could sense it. She spent as much time with me as possible. Squeezed me a little harder. 

I made sure to say goodbye to my mom this time. We shared a great night. 

I thought about bringing up the carousel. If she was aware of everything that was happening. I resisted the urge. I didn’t want to ruin the beautiful cake that was our exchange in that little slice of pleasant reality. 

Then I snuck out in the middle of the night. 

The carousel was at the edge of town. 

*Waiting for me.*

\-

The carousel brought me back to my original reality. 

I feel like I was finally able to process some of the pain of the 25 years before my time back on the carousel. I wouldn’t say I was *happy*. I was content. 

I told the carousel group all about what happened that I would need some time away. 

Then I started to itch. I started monitoring where the carousels were, waiting to find one near me. And I found one. 

\-

I made it to the carousel in-time. It was tucked into an abandoned industrial yard.

The difference this time was the carousel wasn’t running. It was stopped and dark. I was barely able to see it at night. I kept my distance - not liking that it was dark and looking broken down. 

Then I saw someone walk out from the carousel. A shadowy figure. The lights of the carousel flickered on for a moment as they stepped down off of the ride. 

In the flash of the lights of the carousel I saw it was my mom.

I woke up drenched in sweat, the clock read 3:23 am yet it was light outside. I looked out the window and could see the big old oak tree that was there since  I moved in to the house. The tree was big yet it seemed small from the house. I got up checked my phone it was 8 am I missed the bus and now I had to walk to school. I quickly got ready, Did up my shirt buttons , Fastened my tie and put on my blazer. I left for school in a hurry. I got to the biggest college in our city although that doesn't say much as I live in a small rural area with not much going on, but hey at least the housing was cheap. 

The school day was as boring as ever although I could not shake the feeling that something was watching me. Well it did not matter as I went up to my room, relaxed and started watching some YouTube. (Tap Tap Tap) I must have fallen asleep as I awoke to a slight tapping noise on my window. I looked over at the time and my heart skipped a beat when I read what was on the bright red clock 3:23 am it read. I decided to check what the noise was myself so I got up and slowly crept towards the window. As the floor panels creaked beneath me I could feel my heart beat get faster every step I took. I stood in front of the curtains terrified of what I might find but I finally got the courage to open the curtains. as I unveiled what was behind them the tapping stopped, The room went silent however all I could see was the oak tree in the distance however it looked like it had a face and was a bit closer then before. I thought it must have been my imagination so I went back to bed.

I awoke the next day feeling tired yet better the clock read 6:40 am and so I got changed. While I was at school I decided to research about the house as I got an off feeling about it so I headed to the library. When I got there I took a seat and searched up my address and could not believe my eyes. A young girl committed suicide by hanging herself on the tree. Estimated time of death â€¦ 3:23 AM. I went back to the house in a panic and I ran in my room terrified. I went to bed early that day.

TAP TAP TAP the sound was there again this time it was louder 3:23 am I could here something else though Munch Munch Munch Crunch Crunch Crunch. I quickly shot up and unveiled the curtains and when I did I saw the giant oak tree having the most scrumptious, delightful, Mouth watering, succulent and luscious munch on a bird I've seen in my life. I could not help drooling as I saw the sight. The oak tree opened my window and said "wagwan fam, You want some munch" My head shook uncontrollably as he gave me the raw bird. I munched and crunched on it like there was no tomorrow I could not stop myself. Then the oak tree played some tunes and started dancing. I was drawn the the aura of the dancing tree. I started dancing with him i-i-i  could not stop I walked towards him and then. He pulled me out the window and hung me with his tree branch. You may be asking how am I writing this. I am writing this from inside the tree , My phones about to die and I'm living of birds. However I don't want help I want to stay here forever and ever and ever and ever AND EVER AND EVER AND EVER.

I am writing this to you as a warning to always read the terms and conditions, on anything. It may take 10 minutes of your time but it will be worth it I promise. 

This all started last week, I was a game tester in Louisiana and wasn’t making too much money as I was relatively new to the job and the only experience I had with bugs in games is when I reported them when they happened to me. It was a fairly straight forward job, people make a new game and they want their levels checking, see if everything works perfectly so on and so on. It was an on and off job, sometimes it was very fun and other times it was literally hell. Some game designers should just never be game designers. 

There was a time when this company wanted me and my co workers to see if we could find any bugs, and the company was so certain we wouldn’t find any at all.

We found one. On. Every. Single. Level.

That wasn’t even the worst part because you’d expect games to have bugs as no game is perfect, we had someone on every level and each one of us gave the company our feedback on how to fix the the bugs etc but the company kept coming back sure that there wasn’t a bug but somehow they managed to add another bug every time they patched the other one.

Anyways I’m getting sidetracked, so I came into work one day same thing I did the day before and the day before that and the day before that and so on and someone came in. Just one person with a new game, this wasn’t unusual as we had solo developers come in all the time. But this one was different, he had an eerie vibe about him and none of his skin was showing, he was all covered. Again you’re probably thinking, what’s wrong with that? Except it’s the middle of summer. Straight away I knew something was wrong but I shrugged it off. He gave us codes for the game and I set it aside as I went to go make my usual coffee, I get back and get ready to test the game when I drop the piece of paper the code was on and it lands on its front. 

On the back of the paper it read “DONT SKIP THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, READ IT”

“Weird, okay” I thought to myself and entered into the game, I was greeted with a title screen and then pressed continue when I was given the terms and conditions screen. I scrolled along down and it was atleast a 5 minute read, I wasn’t reading all of that. I skipped it all and proceeded to play the game and check for bugs.

A few days pass and the guy comes back in wearing the same clothes as the last time and I tell him I thought his game was really good for a solo developer and that I noticed a really strange bug in one of the levels that sort of looked like the devil, what was odd was it seemed intentional, almost as if it was waving at me in the game. 
After telling him I could see that he removed his face mask and the skin I could see was pale and his lips were quivering.

“P..p..please tell me you r..rea…read the terms and conditions.”

“No? Of course not, should I have?” I replied.

“It doesn’t matter.” He said with unease and he walked away.

That was a week ago, ever since then paranormal things have been happening, I’ve been hearing giggling in the basement and devil rituals around my home, I’ve also been seeing awful things and I haven’t been able to sleep I can’t take this anymore and I really want to kill myself but I feel like I’ll end up in Hell because I think I’m cursed, the terms and conditions of the game were given to me through the post and all I can ask is please, if anyone knows anything, help me.

This is what it said at the end

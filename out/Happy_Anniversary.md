 

It’s calm and quiet working the graveyard shift at a corner store in the middle of nowhere. Atkinson, Nebraska to be exact. I’ve been working here almost 4 years and it’s kept me busy and puts food on the table. It’s a little of the same thing every night. Stock items, check customers out, then back to stocking items, some drunk guys come in and buy cigarettes and beef jerky, stock more items, so on and so on, until my shift is over. I wouldn’t say I enjoy it, but I wouldn’t say I don’t enjoy it either. It’s just a job.

This night was going by a lot slower than usual though. There were fewer customers than normal and there wasn’t that much to stock on the shelves so I was just sitting at the front register all night. It was even more odd because normally around 2:30 AM a nice lady whom I’ve gotten acquainted with named Elise would come into the store and buy a Monster energy drink and a pack of smokes. 

But, she didn’t come in that night. I know she worked at a pizza place close by and got off around 2:30 AM and lived around the corner store. Maybe she was extra tired that night. I enjoyed talking to her. She had a blue and purple ring on one of her fingers that looked mesmerizing. It was the blue of the ocean with the purple of the sunrise. *Oh well*, I thought, *maybe she’d come in tomorrow*, because now it was 4AM and it was the end of my shift.

One of my coworkers, Andy, walked through the front door to take over. We don’t talk much, just “have a good night” and that’s it. I handed him the keys and was on my way to my car. I live about 15 minutes away, a couple towns over and there was never anyone on the roads this late at night which I liked. I could go as fast as I wanted to. I normally sped unless it was a holiday or the weekend, since there were usually more cops out at night.

This night would be different. I was about 10 minutes from my house when I noticed the lights of a car behind me. I didn’t see where they turned from, all of a sudden I just noticed their LED glow. I thought to myself “what the hell are you doing out here this late at night?” I tried to ignore those blinding lights and listen to some music. Some aldn always calmed me down. I figured it was probably a farmer, or maybe a group of teenagers on a late night road trip. Suddenly, the lights were right behind me and I instantly cut the music. I mean if I stomped on my brakes they would definitely hit my car. Now I could see the vehicle better and could make out that it was a white van. Even more weird, there were no windows except for the windshield and the driver and passenger side windows. I picked up my speed to get away from them but they sped up too, staying behind me. I was beginning to freak out and lose my shit when they just zoomed past me on the one lane road. Even though they raced ahead of me, I could make out a “Vietnam Veteran” bumper sticker on the back of the van, above the exhaust pipe.

A feeling of relief washed over my body. I slumped back in my seat and was home in 5 minutes. When I got home, I woke my girlfriend, Eve, up and told her what had happened. She told me it was probably some kids messing with me. I agreed with her.

The next night at the corner store was more normal paced. More customers came in, more shit to stock. I was happy the night was going by so fast, I looked at my watch and it was already 1:30AM! Nothing eventful happened until Elise came into the store.

I waited for her to come to the front desk to ring up her Monster and pack of smokes. She got the same cigarettes every time. Camel Crush Menthol. She finally came to the front desk and I asked her “Camel Crush Menthol?” There was silence for a few seconds as she just looked at the floor. Elise looked horrible. Like she hadn’t slept in days. “Are you okay, Elise?” She sharply looked up at me and said “No, thanks just this tonight,” as she put a bottle of Sprite on the counter. Her gaze never left my eyes as she put the bottle on the counter. This is when I realized that something wasn’t quite right. Elise was always in a good mood, always got Monster, always got smokes. What was going on? “Are you okay, you seem out of it,” I asked again, trying to ask what was wrong without asking. She nodded her head slightly and mumbled, “Yeah, everything is fine. I just really want to go home.” I could see she was uncomfortable, I wasn’t sure why but it didn’t matter. She wanted to leave and I didn’t want to keep her there any longer than was necessary. So I scanned her Sprite, she paid, and was on her way. *Strange*, I thought to myself.

A couple minutes later, I was going to the back to get more stuff to restock when Elise came back inside. I walked back to the counter to see what she needed. “Hey listen, I’m sorry. You’ve always been so nice and I kind of felt rude just now, but it’s been a crazy last 48 hours,” she said. “That’s okay,” I replied, “You don’t need to tell me anything you don’t want to.” “Thank you. I want to tell you because it could be a big help,” she said. “I’m all ears,” I responded, getting really excited for the drama I was about to hear. “My grandpa has been missing for the last two days and it’s just scaring me not knowing where he is. It’s his and my grandma’s anniversary tomorrow and almost 10 years since she passed,” she confessed.

There was a pause between her words as we were having a staring contest. I’m not sure if she was expecting me to say anything, but she started to speak again before I had the chance. “Have you seen him recently? Or seen anything at all that could help?” she asked. That’s when I made the horrific realization of what occurred last night. That’s right. Elise lived with her grandpa. Elise’s grandpa was a Vietnam Veteran. He came into the store a few times in his white van. I was thinking so much about the events of last night I had forgotten I was having a conversation with Elise. “So yeah, I’ll see you later I guess,” she said creeping towards the door. “Elise, wait!” I shouted.

She looked back at me quickly. “Last night, after my shift, I was headed back to my house when this white van was driving behind me and they were getting extremely close to my car. Then out of nowhere, it just zoomed by me and I could see it had a Vietnam Veteran bumper sticker.” “That happened last night?” She asked. “Yeah, I couldn’t make out who was driving though, it was too dark, but I felt in danger when they were getting closer and closer to my car,” I said. Elise now looked like she was going to puke. “Oh my God,” she whispered. Then she ran out the door. “Elise!” I called to her. I tried to run out of the store after her, but she was gone.

In that moment, as I was standing outside in the dark, the only light being the luminescent neon light of the corner store logo above me, I thought about the van, about who could have been in it. I don’t know why Elise’s grandpa would do that to me so I felt like it wasn’t him. His and his wife’s anniversary was the next day. I don’t know if that has anything to do with the situation, but it stayed in the back of my head. There were never any cars on the roads out there past 1AM. But there was last night. Elise’s grandpa’s van. Why would he get so close behind me? Maybe he was a driver with road rage and thought I was going really slow. But then if he was so close to home, why would he be missing? Nothing made sense. I tried to forget about it, but it was just so strange and abnormal.

Eventually it was 4AM and time to hand it off to Andy. I wondered if I had a weird look on my face from thinking about everything that’s happened, but when I handed him the keys he just told me to have a good night. I got in my car to leave, but was wondering if the van would be out on the streets again, trying to scare me. I decided that it was silly and that maybe it was a one time thing. I convinced myself maybe it was a coincidence and maybe it was someone else’s van with a similar bumper sticker. Either way, I had to get home, I couldn't sleep in my car in the store’s parking lot. I was being silly.

So I started my car up and was on my way. I didn’t play any music this time, trying to be alert. At first there were no signs of life that I could see. Just the pale moonlight shining onto the road and cornfields on either side of me. It was calm. Soothing even. But then I saw them again. Halfway to my house and those same, bright, LED lights flashing in my face from behind me. My heart dropped to my stomach. I felt uneasy. Nauseous and about to puke. I didn’t know what to do. The lights were getting bigger and closer. Were they going to do what they did last night? Just get as close to me as possible and vanish into the night? I wasn’t trying to find out. I stomped on the pedal and was going 30 miles over the speed limit. However, that didn’t stop the van. They quickly moved to the other lane, hoping they were going to just pass me again and leave me alone. They were getting closer so that our driver and passenger side windows were lined up. It’s like I was watching a countdown to a new year. Every second passed knowing they were going to be aligned with me. Terror enveloped my entire body. What would they do this time? The van was now aligned with my car. We were both driving the same speed on the straightest of all roads. No cars in front of us, we could do this all night if we wanted.

Then, I heard knocking on the van’s passenger side window. I looked up to it and thought I saw blue and purple light reflecting off the moonlight through the glass. It was a weird color in the dark, surrounded by black, gray, white, and the green on the van’s clock on the dash. I looked closer at the blue and purple and that’s when I noticed it was Elise’s ring. What was even more terrifying was that it was still on Elise’s hand. I could see red on the wrist of where it was cut off. My eyes started to tear up, half from adrenaline, half from seeing Elise’s hand not attached to her body anymore. I looked even higher to see who was holding her hand, to see who was doing this to me. All I could make out was a silhouette of a head with long white hair. They must have seen me looking back at them because then they took the blood from Elise’s severed hand and wrote on the window “You’re Next.”

I damn near shit my pants at this point and slammed on my breaks. The van continued off into the darkness. I sat there for a moment in the silence of the night once I had come to a complete stop, and got out of my car to throw up. After that, I realized I had passed my house. I took a few deep breaths and got back in my car to go home. To Eve. Thankfully I made it back safely, only psychological damage done to me. As soon as I arrived, I woke her up and told her everything and she almost looked as frightened as I did. I told her about Elise and her missing grandpa and asked her if she thought I should call the police. She asked me if I had seen what the license plate number on the van was. I told her I paid no attention to that, but that didn’t seem to be a deal breaker of calling the police. I called them and told them everything. They asked if I had seen the license plate number too. I said I hadn’t but it was a white van with no windows, bright LED lights, and had a bumper sticker that said Vietnam Veteran above the exhaust. They told me they would be on the lookout for the van and hung up. I didn’t get any sleep that night. I don’t think Eve got much sleep either. I thought about how I had another shift at the store tonight from 8PM-4AM. I desperately didn’t want to go in, but we were behind on our mortgage payments and credit cards. I had no choice.

The next night, I came into work as usual and did my daily tasks. Stock, stock some more, checkout customers, stock. It went by pretty quickly and at about midnight, Randy, the owner came in. He told me he wasn’t getting much sleep and wanted to check in on the place. He went to the back office while I stayed at the front. I was glad he was here. I knew everything’s been happening on the road, but I didn’t want to be alone anywhere. A couple more hours go by of not much of anything and it was about 2AM. I had a feeling Elise wouldn’t be coming in tonight. The picture of her bloody hand is scorched into my retinas. The bloody message next to it. I was planning on working until the sun came up tonight. 230AM came and there was no sign of Elise. I know it’s cruel to say, but I figured she had to be dead. Why would they cut off her hand and then send her back home? What if her grandpa cut off her hand? No, I am having the weirdest thoughts.

The store was empty so I decided to go to the office and talk to Randy. That would get my mind off things. I walked into the office and asked Randy, “Hey, Randy. How’s it going?” I asked, “Hey, Vince. Well, I can’t complain. My business is making me plenty of money, and I got a great staff. Speaking of which, you better get back to the front, them items ain’t gon’ scan themselves now.” Damn it. Back to lonesome. I checked out a total of 2 customers from 3AM-4AM. The slowest hour all week. Andy came in and stuck his hand out for me to give him the keys. I couldn’t. No way I was going to drive at night anymore. “Hey, you know Andy, I think I’m gonna stay here a little bit,” I said. “Boss okay with that?” he asked. “Well, I haven’t asked yet, but I’m sure it’s fine,” I admitted. “Hmm,” Andy growled with a smug look on his face. He walked back to the office. They were both in there for maybe 30 seconds when Randy comes out and yells, “Now look boy, I’m running a business and I ain’t got the money to pay you overtime.” “But Randy I-” I began to plead. “Nope, you gotta go now boy, we’ll see ya tomorrow,” he said.

I thought about it and decided that if the van shows up again I’ll just avoid them. I’ll speed ridiculously fast. I’ll stop and turn around real quick. I’ll just get away from them. I gave Andy the keys and went out the door. Started my car up confidently and headed home. I was watching my rearview mirror like a hawk for those bright lights. Only about 2 or 3 minutes after I left the corner store, there they were. Farther than the last couple of nights, but I knew them when I saw them. Differently though, they were going the fastest they’ve ever gone. They were just behind my car in about a few seconds. BUMP! The van hit the back of my car. I could feel myself lose grip of the steering wheel but quickly found it again. I realized they were going to try to kill me tonight, or maybe even worse. I jerked to the left side of the road and waited for the van. Once they were behind me I was going to quickly get back to the right side of the road and stomp on my brakes and turn around. I Waited, and waited, and waited… They never got behind me. They just sped up so now we were aligned again, just like the night before.

I tried my hardest to see who was driving and it looked like an elderly woman. Her white snowflake hair was greasier than the night before. She had wrinkles all over her face. An ugly woman. CRASH! She hit the side of my car, sending me to the side of the road. It happened so fast but I don’t remember much of it. I stopped when I hit a ditch and hit my head on my steering wheel, so hard like a machine press stamping labels on boxes. I want to say I was knocked out for only a few minutes because then I saw the van had crashed too. Head on into a tree. The driver side door was wide open. I looked around for the woman. I couldn’t see anything, it was just too dark and foggy. She could be looking right at me, waiting to pounce on me from the darkness. I fidgeted my keys to get my car running again, but the engine was stuttering. “Come on, not now! Not fucking now!” I screamed, kicking the side of the door.

I kept switching my sight from my keys to the area around me. No sight of her still. I kept trying to start the engine, but it wasn’t happening. Then suddenly, a face appeared right next to me through my driver side window. The woman. She had blood dripping down her head and onto her clothes. Maybe it was from hitting the tree, but maybe it was Elise’s, or someone else. She was pounding on the window trying to break it and she began screaming, “He was mine! He was mine! He’s always been mine!” Finally, the engine started and I floored the pedal as fast as I could. I drove away looking back to the woman in my rearview mirror. She just stood there watching me make my escape. I got home and talked to Eve about it and we decided I will get a new job. Somewhere in town. Somewhere that's only open during the daytime.

A few weeks later, I started a job at a big home improvement store right in the middle of town. My shifts would now be 8AM-4PM. The exact opposite of my last job at the corner store and I couldn’t be happier. It was my first day there and I was looking for parking when I stopped and stomped on the brakes. I could see a white van parked near the front of the store. I was only looking at it from the side but it had no windows. I thought to myself, *this town has more people, so it’s a lot more likely someone will have a white van.* I drove around it to see the back of it and I was immediately filled with dread as I read “Vietnam Veteran” above the exhaust pipe.

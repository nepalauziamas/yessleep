And when the trouble really started

When I first saw Natalia all I could picture was Georgia. The way her skin melted off her face, the smell of her hair burning and the sound that she made. 

I didn’t have time to count but there were more than I originally thought. I figured these must have been the 15 people Prudence talked about, entering the flats that burned before it happened. I already knew that Natalia was one of them. 

Eddie and Ellie clutched Terri’s skirt, trembling with fear. I wanted to help protect them, but I still couldn’t help but tremble a little myself every time I caught a glimpse of those hollow voids where their eyes were. 

“Hi Terri, the kids said we could borrow some sugar?” She asked menacingly, grinning at the frightened family stood next to me. After a moment or two of intense staring Natalia finally addressed me. She appeared to be the spokesperson for the group. “How’s your friend doing? It was a shame we had to end our visit. I was enjoying her company.”

“Don’t speak about her! She’s got nothing to do with you, you sick bitch!” I screamed at her, I couldn’t bare looking at her face again. “You don’t scare me with all your freak friends. I’m not going to let you hurt this lady or her kids!”

Natalia chuckled. I gulped. 

I may talk a good game but I am no hero. Mere days ago I was just a young girl excited to move in with her boyfriend and now here I am. My boyfriend’s dead, my flat is like living in my own personal horror movie and I’m standing up challenging demonic flame neighbours to defend demonic looking children. 

But when I said she didn’t scare me, I meant it. Something inside me was eradicating any fear of these people, I just wanted to protect the residents. Life really does throw curveballs. 

“I know you aren’t scared. I saw it in your eyes when you stuck that big knife in my throat. That’s why we’re here.

“My brothers and sisters are not freaks. You’re the freaks! Thinking that your lives have meaning. We watch you people go about your day to day lives and your mundane routines and nothing really changes. Your lives are pointless and disposable.

“That’s why we set the fire, all those years ago.”  She chuckled throughout her words. There was an animation in them like she was a psychotic cartoon character, finally catching its prey after 138 episodes of chasing. 

“Those people weren’t disposable...” Terri mumbled, barely a decibel higher than a whisper.

“What was that Terri? Did you have something to say.” Natalia went from psychotic cartoon to school bully. She made my skin crawl.

“I was only a child, but those people were friends of my parents, they were good people.” Terri said with slightly more confidence. 

None of the other people had moved. They just stood there staring. 

“Why would you burn people alive? What can you possibly gain?” I interjected, taking a slight step between Natalia and Terri and the kids. I could see she was getting ready to go for them and I couldn’t let it happen. 

“We were living with the great leader, Michael. All of us. Living in the righteous manner that he had directed us to live” She gestured to the people around her. The name Michael appeared to inspire some sort of emotion in the group. 

“Michaels brother Jonathan lived here, on the floor we burned. He let us hang out there sometimes, but he didn’t live the righteous way that we did. He didn’t like our beliefs, but he took us in when we lost the place we were staying because of the growth of the group. Him and Michael rarely saw eye to eye. They argued passionately. 

“Our group never believed in living within the constraints of societal norms and we were up at all hours, we came and went as we pleased, embracing freedoms and listened to music as we did introspective work.” 

Terri shoved the kids further behind her and snapped, infuriated. 

“You were a group of entitled, bratty hippies following some middle aged, mentally ill twat. Listen to yourself! The stereotypical cultish drivel coming out of your mouth right now!” Terri cried. I was shocked at her outburst. Although I couldn’t have agreed more. It did sound like cultish drivel. It made me so angry that this was what an entire floor of people died over. 

As Terri ended her rant the curtains hanging on the window behind her burst into flames. I jumped and felt my heart skip a beat. 

“Don’t insult us. I’m sick of hearing simple minded people call us a cult.” Came from the back row. An average looking man with dark hair and jeans had piped up, smiling and watching the curtains burn. He had done that. They were all capable of what Natalia had done to Georgia at the very least.

For the first time since the people had entered Terri’s flat my nerves of steel had wavered. I realised that we were only alive because they were allowing it so far. We were in big trouble.

Terri swiftly shut up and Natalia continued her story.

“Michael was the true leader. Not like all the fakes you hear of in the news. The people you’re talking about. He was teaching us to build a world of peace and harmony. But he didn’t deny that in order to do that you had to eradicate the non believers. He taught us to embrace the bad in us. To harness it so that we could do extraordinary things.” She smiled wickedly as her hands glowed hot coals as she spoke. 

It may have sounded like cultish drivel but Michael being a total faker wouldn’t explain their powers. 

“Things went wrong when someone went to the police after Michael and Jonathan had a terrible argument one night. When the police arrived Jonathan told us to go. 

The group had been planning to leave this building anyway. We’d had nothing but interruption and trouble in our time here, this place is weird. But we had nowhere immediate to go. The police already disliked us after overcrowding the last property. We didn’t need any more attention. 

“Michael was furious. We brainstormed in a field for hours who could have done it. I personally suspected the next door neighbour, Mavis. The woman was so nosey, always knocking and asking us to keep noise down, interrupting our spiritual sessions. 

“Michael couldn’t make a certain judgement on the person who had done it. All we thought we were sure of was that they had to be on the same floor. So he instructed us to go back that night and eradicate the whole floor and every non believer who lived there. 

“As you know, we obliged.” This incited sick laughter from the crowd. I waited, forcing myself to let her finish. Buying time. 

“We took pleasure in their screams, in watching every man woman and child go up in flames through their front door windows. It was the first time we’d unleashed all that energy and we felt so powerful!

“But then as we left the burning hallway behind us and entered the stairwell, this building found a way to fuck us over one more time. 

“I couldn’t give you a number on the amount of times we tried to run down those stairs, leave our glorious victory behind us and return to Michael. It didn’t matter how many times we tried. 

“We couldn’t make it past that floor, the stairs wouldn’t let us. It didn’t take long before the fire reached the stairwell we were trapped in, burning us all, along with the non believers. We died just in time for the fire engine to arrive. 

“We may have been dead but we didn’t disappear. We couldn’t leave the building, we were stuck just wandering it, in and out of the burned flats and hallways but not allowed anywhere else unless we were asked. It was awful. We didn’t try to cause any trouble at first. We waited for Micheal to come and find us, instruct us. 

“Two months passed and he hadn’t come. Instead came confirmation. A newspaper put through the door of the building. Headline news. 

“*Tower block resident Bernie Hemmings information vital to imprisonment of local cult leader on drug charges.*”

I gasped. I couldn’t believe I hadn’t found that when I was researching Prue. But I suppose local news wasn’t so heavily online back then. Natalia saw my shocked expression and grinned wider than before.

“The old bat didn’t tell you that then?” She asked, although it wasn’t really a question. “That her stupid husband is the whole reason we’re here!” 

“We started to really cause issues then. Did anything within our power to fuck the whole building over. But it didn’t take them long to work out that we had to be asked to come in. 

“We only stopped when Prue worked out a way we could die a second time, and that we wound come back again. She killed two of our group. She was the only person that could stop us. We couldn’t do shit with her around. We stopped and reached a stalemate. Then she moved out. We were going to honour that stalemate. Until you stabbed me. Prue’s gone. It’s fair game in here now.”

As Natalia got angrier a member of her group started getting agitated, they all soon followed like a hive mind, working as one, the stillness became chaotic, with all of them moving and making noise. 

I didn’t notice at first when one started walking towards Terri and the kids, but I noticed when it got near.

It was a teen girl, slender and pretty, but still unsettlingly average. As she got within a metre of the family Ellie suddenly went rigid. The claws that replaced her fingernails grew longer and sharper, with jagged edges from growing so fast. The voids deepened, if that was even possible. 

She opened her mouth to reveal rows of sharp teeth, blood caked where the tooth meets the gum where they had grown too quickly as well. Ellie jumped. She reached out towards the girl and slashed her face with the claws, leaving deep gouges across her eyes.  She clung on to the girl using her claws as wall pegs keeping herself at eye level. 

Eddie controlled the crowd. His own claws grew and he ran towards them, sending them scattering out of the flat, random bursts of flames erupted everywhere. Lighting up the whole room. 

Shit had hit the fan. The two demon children were successfully fending off a group of 15 dead superhuman cultists. Natalia ran from them too, but kept her eyes locked on mine as she did. As she ran from the flat she spoke to me. 

“This isn’t over!” She screamed, and I knew that it wasn’t. 

I stayed on Terri’s sofa that night, we organised all the burned items in the house and threw things out before we crashed out in the early hours. The kids claws retracted and they returned to their earlier state. Causing mischief in the hallways. They were too young to really understand.

I didn’t sleep much. Nothing new. 

When I woke up Terri was still asleep. I didn’t want to disturb her so I walked back to my flat, desperate to avoid anything strange on my way. The stairs must have noticed, because they didn’t skip on my way up. 

I hadn’t checked the time when I left Terri’s but I reached my door at the same time as a familiar face. Postman Ian was stood there, dropping letters on my doorstep. 

“Hey, love!” He shouted as he noticed me. 

“I need to talk, can you come inside, just five minutes? Please?” I practically begged him at the doorstep.

I told him everything that had happened the night before. How Natalia was out for revenge and I was the object of her rage. I begged him to tell me how to kill them, but he claimed he didn’t know. He said if kept my doors locked and didn’t let them in then I’d be fine. 

He looked shirty as I mentioned killing them. Didn’t even suggest asking Prudence how to do it. Something was telling me there wasn’t much point.  He seemed so disingenuous.

I wanted to trust him. So badly I wanted to trust him. I had been so vulnerable with him over Jamie.

But if Prudence Hemmings could forget to mention what Bernie had done, and conveniently never pass on the method to kill these awful people, leaving them around to terrorise her friends and neighbours... then could she be a liar too. Could I really trust Ian? 

When he provided no answers and no real help something inside me told me that I needed to get him out of my flat. I needed to rethink. Start working things out on my own. I made excuses to Ian and sent him on his rounds. 

Prudence left me these rules, but she left so much out. How do I know I wasn’t always a pawn in some sick game. Her fantasy life as a puppet master, setting me up to fail. She’s kept her granddaughter in a cage for years. Maybe she enjoys suffering. 

I wasn’t going to give up easily though. Natalia wasn’t going to win. 

I decided then and there that I needed to attend the committee meeting today and start building an army against Natalia. I didn’t need Prue’s help or her methods. With enough manpower I could do it myself. 

This was war.

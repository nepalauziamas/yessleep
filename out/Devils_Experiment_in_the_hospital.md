If you go out on yelp you will see a lot of negative reviews about this hospital in Maryland, mainly about long waiting, rude nurses not helping anybody. Some as bad as being left out in the hallway for hours with serious wounds. Unfortunately my story gets much darker. I went to this hospital thinking I would get better quality service since it was in a better zip code than where I lived, worst mistake I ever made. I walked in wanting to get evaluated by a doctor. I was under high stress and isolation in college. I was staying up for days and not eating to the point it concerned my parents. I was also convinced I was being stalked by people with telepathy.

The main ER waiting room wasn’t a problem at all but once I was sent back into a holding room for psych patients it got really weird. The nurses at the nurses station started talking like they were an alien species and it freaked me out. They were tormenting this mentally ill guy, calling up his daughter on the phone and then made him confess to her that he wanted to have sex with her. By the end of it, he was calling himself "Kathy", the name of the head nurse, and on my way back from the bathroom I saw him in his waiting room masturbating like crazy and crying. This was still technically the ER mind you, not the psych ward.

After they gave me some juice (probably drugged) I fell asleep for what seemed like a few hours (I had no clue what time it was when I woke up, they took my phone, there was no clock and the room was windowless) and nurse Kathy yells "How long have you been here?" Since she was there when I first arrived she should have known and it was probably still the same shift. Nonetheless she laughed and said something like "It doesn't matter, it's Groundhog Day, every day is the same" Since it was a windowless room it could have been several days how could I have known?

When the doctor showed up I tried to tell him something was wrong with the nurses but he just looked at me like I needed to be admitted. Once he left again, Kathy walked up to my chair got in my face and said "Life is hard" and then ended her shift.

After that the remaining nurses were yelling to each other back and forth, saying they couldn't believe it, acting like a catastrophe was happening outside. I started pacing because I was getting really anxious and did not want to be admitted to a place like this. The nurse looked up at me pacing and said "Crazy" and went back to acting like a lunatic herself. It seemed like everyone in that room was sped up, walking back and forth super-fast.

Finally it all went to hell when I put my hands on the exit door. The security and nurses tackled me, saying "He's breaking programming!" and it terrified me. They secured me in a chair and gave me a needle in the arm and then dragged me to a back room where they threw me onto a bed and bound me to it, not before ripping my hospital pants off (with no underwear underneath). I was exposed and trembling like crazy as they laughed and gathered around me, speaking in words I could never pronounce, speaking like bug people, or some weird demonic language. "All because the Serbs were dying" the one nurse groaned in the background, arms crossed, looking at me with contempt.

The black security guard was hovering right over my face, his eyes wide with excitement and then looked at the guy across him and said "We got one" He was giddy.

At that point I thought they were going to murder me and I must have passed out because a few minutes later the room was dark. I was still on the bed but unbound and still without my pants. I was in a trance, not knowing what was happening. Once I left the room I realized a new shift started with different people working and a male nurse shouted at me asking why I was wearing no pants.

They soon put me in a wheelchair to be sent over to the psych ward, not without first passing Kathy, back at work and smiling at me with fake, almost taunting sympathy. I was rocking back in forth, I must have looked deranged.

In that psych ward, I believe an MK-ultra experiment was happening. Mind you, this was 2016, right before Stranger Things and all the conspiracies started going mainstream about Mk ultra. I only pieced this together later and thought my experience on the ward was similar to the conditions explained in those 1970s interviews of victims.

They gave me medication without telling me what it was. They gave me this weird pill that made it difficult for me to breathe and when I was freaking out on the floor, crying for help, the nurses said "lets give him some air" and opened the back patio door. Thing is, it was freezing temperatures out, snow everywhere and the patio was obviously closed off. They said "go on, go out there" and I didn’t want to. I was afraid they would let a nearby patient slam the door behind me and lock me out in the freezing cold. It wasn't paranoia, this patient was following me around everywhere taunting me nonstop.

People on that ward were really damaged, both the patients and the nurses. Their eyes would roll into the back of their heads and they would move around like literal puppets on strings. They threw this one Arab guy in the dark room non-stop until one day, he was following me around with a broken pencil acting like he wanted to shank me with it.

I was so stressed out and terrified I couldn't swallow food from breakfast and the doctor in that morning's day room meeting watched me regurgitate my food in group with sadistic glee. There was a day I thought I was going home with my parents and when it turned out I wasn’t and they left without me, the staff erupted into laughter like hyenas that echoed throughout the ward.

Thus I can’t end this without telling you many of these people had red or serpent eyes. I thought I was literally living in the end times. One night when everyone was asleep, I left my room and went to talk to a security guard at a nearby table. We spoke, I forget about what but I remember him comparing me to Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz and that was his favorite movie. His eyes then lit up yellow with the pupils like a serpent. I never believed in this crazy shit before then. When I saw the footage of “reptilians” online I thought they were easily manipulated and fake.

I got up from the table mid conversation and left and for the rest of my stay there I felt like I was going insane. I called it the Frankenstein experiment because I was starting to look like Frankenstein in the mirror. But thank god insurance wouldn’t pay longer than 8 days. They had to discharge me and despite freaking me out, reading my mind and messing with me and insulting me to my face using my personal thoughts and memories, they didn't break me. They said they wanted me to have a “melt down" I guess so they could keep me longer but I didn't so I was discharged. The following year was hell and I won’t even get into that with this post.

I was on yelp hoping to find reviews or some reports somewhere reporting abuse at that place but the only complaints I have found was about the other wards, not the psych ward.

REVIEWS FROM OTHER WARDS

The nurses walk around like they're in a fashion show. I've never seen so much sashaying, slipper dragging behavior outside of someone's Sunday morning bedroom.

Don't need anything. You will wait. And wait some more. The staff appears to be completely unaccountable. Poor record keeping, no one knows anyones last name. Medication distribution is haphazard.

If you have a choice, you might be better off somewhere else. I hate to think this is a standard in our country's medical care.

The PCT's and nurses on the 3rd floor are some of the worst! Especially a Nicole (PCT), Ann (Nurse), Soo (Nurse). They would push and pull on my grandfather, scream at him, make jokes of his situation, very hostile, rude, and no bedside manner. They were often on their cell phones. In this line of work, they shouldn't be on them. They should gave more compassion and empathy for their patients or get out of the field!!!

Better off Dead. A morbid half truth because if you EVER need this hospital for an emergency you will wish you had died instead. We spent 11 hours in ER and still left without all of the tests!

Yes, that's right, The 2nd richest county in the country offers a real life 3rd world experience for its ritzy residents. Here's what to expect. Sit and suffer for hours on end. Feeling pain? Sit for hours! Feeling nauseous? They will give you a lovely blue vomit bag for you to use over and over for hours in that crowded room as you continue waiting! Come in on an ambulance? Guess what? You'll get shoved in that awful waiting room to what..WAIT!

I was here early in the year for an ER visit, and suffered through being shoved in a too small , overpacked waiting room for hours on end, never a bed, never a room. I was told it was due to renovations. This time, 9 months later I was with a friend, over 7 hours in the same horribly crowded and cramped tiny waiting room, people with varying emergencies handed vomit bags because they won't be seen anytime soon, sitting beside hunger starved families eating McDonalds because the children can't go 6 hours without food. I think my favorite was seeing staff wheel patients from the wait room to the hall to check vitals to make sure you're still alive, only to roll you back outside to wait for more hours.

Wait time 6-9 hours, the chairs are broken, the nurses are MEAN! It's filthy dirty. They put an uncomfortable IV attachment in my daughter's arm HOURS before she is to be seen. It's a BAD situation AVOID this GROSS germ infested hospital. The nurses actually yell at us! I accidentally tried to open a door and Nurse Hatchet yelled DO NOT pull on the door! An elderly woman has been here for 9 NINE freggin HOURS!!!! That is not ok! People are suffering. This is inhuman and abusive.We are still here. It's been 6 hours. They are still rude. Finally we get my daughter's diagnosis and all we want to do is go, and RN 1 curtly says, "we cleaned the waiting room and saw your review on yelp" then the other girl, proceeds to confront my sick daughter about her blood work process. It's 4 am we checked in at 6 pm .

Please I'm begging stay away from this hospital. I don't think I can stress this enough!!!

The staff won't make eye contact with you because they know you have questions they can't or don't want to answer.

We're waiting in a "sub waiting room," which I'm pretty sure used to be a broom closet.

When we got to the hospital to meet them, I was shocked that they had already been sitting in the waiting room for almost an hour in the condition that they were in. Granted, it may not be considered an emergency to ER standards, but they were obviously not in the greatest condition. We were at the hospital with them from 4:30pm-8:30pm before they were actually seen. They were taken in for x-rays. However, they couldn't have back x-rays performed because they didn't have the proper equipment on location.

a gentleman came in with a bleeding forehead. He had an obvious large gash and couldn't stop bleeding. When we left at 11pm, he was still waiting in the lobby with a bloody towel attached to his forehead.

Stay away from this ER!!! Nurses joking at the front desk, being rude to very sick patients, people leave after long hours of not being seen! STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOSPITAL! Worse customer care ever!

This is quite possibly the worst hospital in the entire mid-Atlantic. I would rather perform surgery on myself with a pair of rusty scissors than ever come here again. The only reason it gets one star is because the vending machine accepts Apple Pay, which is a nice connivence. Vote for Daddy Bernie 2020.

Waited in the disgusting er waiting room for 4 hours before finally getting a room. Drs never showed so I asked the nurse to remove my complimentary iv line and I left. Got there at midnight and was told with my condition I would wait less than hour. Staff was rude and defensive when you asked any questions. There was another patient in tremendous discomfort which looked like appendicitis and he was waiting just like me. Don't go here unless you're dead. Wait, go somewhere else if you're dead, this place isn't competent enough to deal with a corpse.

Horrible! At this hospital for 5 hours just for a knee xray. The night nurses are rude. They stay in their personal phones and when you ask questions you get answers with attitudes. These reviews are real facts about this hospital. This was my first and last time coming here.

A lot of nasty, needlessly combative people work here. When we were brought into the room, the bed was literally covered in used bloody sheets and blanket that were never changed despite multiple requests. Patients here are denied basic amenities like water. Took hours and many many requests to get a single cup of water that we had to squirrel away (couldn’t spare a sip) because we might not get it again - heaven forbid we ask for a morsel of food or an extra blanket (it’s freezing and loud and dirty.) We could clearly see the nurse we asked for water hanging out, being on her phone. Meanwhile the experience costs more than the most expensive hotel room in the world.

Do NOT and I mean do not go to this hospital for any type of emergency care unless you don’t want to walk back out! This hospital killed my healthy grandmother a few weeks ago all because they simply did not care. They did not take the proper steps and made MANY mistake along the way. The nurses that we had were awful and had attitudes as well as not giving her anything she asked for including medication. They not only let her suffer, but watched her die in their care! I am in no way exaggerating and we are already on top of making sure this never happens again to anyone else. I am not just a grieving granddaughter that needs to point blame on someone in order for me to feel better. This really happened and proof is everywhere you turn.

I have been in the medical field for 40 yrs. My mother had been taken to the ERSeveral times for care.  The nurses are a disgrace, many should leave the profession, and this was BEFORE Covid . The wait times outrageous, communication nonexistent admitting MDs that don't listen, and look put upon when they have to do an H and P and orders.....no compassion....AVOID this ER unless you want to be treated rudely, disrespectfully and don't mind waiting forever to be assessed i.e. triaged and treated.

This place is a dystopian nightmare. My mother with cancer was admitted from the ER and they denied her water for three hours because “it’s not an emergency”. Ok, but it’s basic human decency and also - most people WOULD argue that a dehydrated stage IV cancer patient is an emergency. I mentioned to my mother that her symptoms might be related to her medication - the nurse interrupted and said, “Well I don’t think that A could cause B” - well ok, but I was mentioning it (to someone who isn’t you) because it’s literally listed on the bottle as a possible side effect. Despite the astronomical cost of care, the facility is largely falling apart. But what’s worse - everyone is rude, inept, and acts like you’re an inconvenience.

Worst ER and triage nurses. Left me in the hall for hours. I was sobbing because of the pain. No one would help me. I called my partner to come and get me after 2 hours. I left triage with needles still in my hands. Triage nurses were angry and one intentionally hurt me. How can a nurse be so cruel because I wanted to protect myself? They are cruel. They made up lots of excuses and when that didn’t work they attacked me for lying about my symptoms.

If I could give this hospital a zero, I would. Most of the staff are rude, lack compassion, and don’t listen. Most of the security staff is just as rude. I’ve literally heard them laughing and talking about patients, outside my room, very loudly, while I was trying to sleep. And also, when I had my items I brought with me returned to me. They didn’t return all my original items. I called the hospital, and they told me I could come and receive my items. However, it was early in the morning, and there was no way I could go out of my way to the hospital, and make it to work on time. When I complained, and said I shouldn’t have to travel back to hospital because of the level of incompetence, the woman over the phone literally said” What do you want me to do? It is not my problem.”

Terrible experience with the Emergency Department. There nurse running the front desk right now lacks professionalism and sensitivity. I’m literally watching waiting patients being talked to in a condescending manner. Where is the compassion? Even if a patient is irritable (because they are in pain) it’s no reason to talk down to them. It is terrible to watch.

Waited 2 hours and got charged nearly $600 just to be told they have no idea whether I had a hernia or not... Save yourself some time, money and the headache, just go to patient first or another hospital. Can't stress enough how horrible this place is

Employees at this hospital should make it easy for patient and their family here. No one wants to be in hospital, we already have a tough time for being here. Please don't make it harder on patient and their family. If you are coming here for your paid hours, then you should give your job to other who is willing to come here to get paid and help other. Come to work with a smile and be ready to help. The service is terrible and it takes way too long to do anything.

I've lived in other parts of the country, This is the worst example of the Medical Industrial Complex I've ever seen.

WARING NEVER UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES USE THIS HOSPITAL. IF I COULD GIVE A RATING OF MINUS 5 STARS I WOULD.This hospital is definitely the absolute worst hospital i have ever seen or been to. They are rude when you try to find out about a patient . The nurse keeps saying we can't give out any information while chucking over the phone. The front desk nurse gives you a number to call when you go into the er and that is what happens. AGAIN DO NOT USE THIS HOSPITAL THEY ARE RUDE AND THEY DONT CARE .

the senior staff are convinced that they are doing a great service.

Do not ever use this hospital for anything. I intend on filing a formal complaint against them. I sat in the ER for almost 5 hours and never was seen. The pictures are the trash that was all over the floor of the waiting room, and the picture of the blanket is where I sat on something when I sat in one of the chairs. The attitude of the staff is awful. They gave me a breathing treatment, pain meds, protonics, and IV fluids, all without me being seen by a Dr. The other patients were just as bad one lady even stated they had already been there for 6 hours, one of the patients an older gentleman had waited so long he had urinated all over himself and the chair. I witness them make one gentleman get up from his wheelchair to come to them even though he stated that he was in a wheelchair. This is the worse hospital I have even been to and will not go back there even if on my death bed.

They absolute worst hospital in the area. If you want your loved ones cared for and comfortable DONT come here. The staff bedside manners are horrible so much attitude and do things so gruff that they pull and hurt the patient. Nurses are not very competent barely can use the computers. They don’t show up and ignore patients for hours at a time. Can’t even get water or blankets for hours at a time. The hospital room I was assigned was bug infested. They rooms are NOT a clean, housekeeping shows up maybe every third day. Poor hospital with poor facilities. I will never recommend or return again. Honestly they should shut down for good.

Forgive me if this isn’t allowed here, but I just wanted to make this known, being that my good friend, Kyle, AKA Big Sp00k was pretty prominent on this sub. Unfortunately he passed away a couple days ago due to a terrible tragedy. I just want to say rest in power to my brother Kyle. READ HIS FUCKIN STORIES. YOU WONT REGRET IT.

RIP u/TheBigSp00k!

Again, sorry if this isn’t allowed here.

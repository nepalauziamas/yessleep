About a month or so ago, i began receiving some calls... now this could be normal, but i am antisocial and i don’t sign up for anything, so there is no way they should have my number. So about a month ago the first call came in.

Phone rings
Me: “hello?”
OL(other line):””
OL:hangs up

That happened two or three more times until a call came in where the whole time there was a loud indistinguishable noise almost like tv static, but it was listed under my mothers number.

So after a week i started to get paranoid because things in the house were not where they were supposed to be. As i type this now that piece of  shit is probably moving stuff around. So first my coat was on the floor instead of the coat rack, i live alone by he way, so i put it back up on the rack and go down stairs. Just then i receive a call that in a shitty text to speech voice says “hey you, when was the last time you looked outside?” When the OL hangs up and my power goes out. As i look out the window, i see a pair of glowing, not just little dots like an animal, light was refracted onto the ground from this things eyes.

In a state of panic i hide. I hear my front door open then abruptly slam. I had hidden myself inside a wardrobe and I didn’t think it’d find me, but i heard footsteps and heavy breathing looming closer and closer... suddenly i heard a whole fuck ton of scraping as everything in my house moved around, i fell over, but luckily in a way i could still get out. I heard the front door open and slam shut. Was it really gone though? Could something that terrible really be gone?

Two days later and the web cams arrived. Twenty of them positioned around my house and fusebox, about twenty feet from the house. For context i also live in the woods so no, the police couldn’t do anything. That same night, i received a call, with the same shitty tts that said “repent, repent, repent” on a five second loop.  Abruptly, but expectedly, the power went out and i instead hid in the cellar, which had a lock on it.

I heard a knock, i remained silent, two knocks, silence, three knocks and the creature had begun shrieking. After that i hear a thud, a crash, then nothing. When the power comes back on, i go out of the cellar to the kitchen to see the fridge was knocked over... but i never heard IT leave, so i sneak back up to the cellar. I wait it out and it leaves.

So i go to stay in town with a friend. I received a call with the tts that said “YOU CANNOT RUN” in a loud manner. Again, the power goes out so i pull my friend to a hiding place and tell them to shut up and wait. Things start flying and after we have waited it out i leave as my friend tries to interrogate me. He hasn’t seen anything else and i have only had one more encounter. So first of all i receive the telltale phone call, it says “wake up, wake up, wake up” looping for thirty seconds. While the phone call is going on the creature is right outside my window. 

It was about 10 feet tall, lengthy as hell, like 15 feet arms 5 feet legs and a 2 foot neck. Its eyes glow green like a flashlight though, it has eyes strewn about its face. It has pale skin and a strange mouth, it seems big enough to swallow an elephant. It has not been turning off the power or calling me but on some nights i will feel a breeze when the windows are shut, or hear whispering, or hear tapping at the window, they usually mean “i am here” and i know you guys were telling me to check the web cams, but they don’t run without power to the house and they don’t have night vision unfortunately due to false advertisement.

It's not just Sophie.  This is bigger than I thought.  And the worms are really making me suffer. 

I have made some startling discoveries since my last post, and in spite of my best efforts I can't rationalise what's happening.  I'm going to assume you're all [up to speed with the story so far](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ulqsaq/i_received_a_text_from_my_wife_while_sat_next_to/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and continue where I left off. 

I can't thank you enough for your advice on my last post.  Well, I really appreciate the gesture, but I don't think things panned out quite the way I'd hoped. 

I was recommended a de-worming medication called ivermectin, and managed to track down some of the paste by visiting a farm supply shop.  I took a gamble and bought an excessive supply of the stuff.  Thankfully, the guy behind the counter was stoned out of his skull, and either didn't notice that I looked like a walking corpse or didn't care.  Either way, the only question he asked was "what for?" and he seemed satisfied with my mumbled response of "animals". 

I think I'm getting better at this deception thing. 

Having measured and taken three times the recommended dose, I convulsed and threw up so hard I thought I'd meet an organ.  Those black worms fed to me by the imitation of my wife were still inside, and were making their malice known.  I fought to keep down another two doses, wanting to send them a message of my own. 

It had been four days since I left, and I finally had a plan.  I may have felt half-dead, but what remained was functioning on pure determination. 

The sky was cloudless, the day so bright it felt like an insult.  At least the window glare might work in my favour, I thought, parked across the road from Harriet's house. 

This was the last place I knew Sophie had visited - my Sophie, the real Sophie.  She had not returned, but something had come home masquerading as her.  There was a chance, however slim, that I might find her here alive.  Failing that, I might at least find out what happened to her. 

A marked police car rolled up in front of me, just on time. 

I had called ahead, claiming there had been an altercation between Sophie and Harriet, bookending my story with half-truths to make it easier to weave.  I told them Sophie had gone over to confront Harriet about a missing phone.  I told them a friend had heard a commotion while walking past that night - shouting, things being thrown.  I told them Harriet was unpredictable, with a dangerous reputation.  Then I finished with the absolute truth.  I told them Sophie hadn't come home for days, and that I was gravely worried. 

They almost caught me out when they asked why I hadn't reported her missing already.  I choked on my own words, launching into a fit of hacking coughs, but somehow that worked to my advantage.  "You don't sound too healthy yourself," they said, handing me an excuse which I clung to like driftwood after a ship wreck.  Somehow, everything was going better than expected. 

Two uniformed police officers approached Harriet's door.  One knocked, while the other took a step away and glanced around the street.  Instinctively I shrunk down in the car seat as they looked in my direction, then chided myself as I realised how suspicious the move would seem if I were spotted.  I awkwardly scooted back upright, and the last scraps of my confidence dissolved when I noticed the police officer staring right at me.  The window glare had not worked in my favour as I'd hoped - they had witnessed the whole of my pathetic pogo-dance routine, and leaned in to whisper something to their partner.  Both were facing me now.  One took out a notepad.  I wanted to shrink back down into the footwell, but told myself _look normal, be normal,_ and held my ground for a second - until my nose erupted with another enormous bleed. 

I swore loudly, grabbing a thick wad of tissues and holding my face down into it, waiting for the draining flow to stop.  By the time it cleared and I raised my head, the officers had disappeared into the house.  I blinked, relief giving way to despair before it could even take hold.  My plan had hinged on witnessing either Sophie or Harriet answering the door, and now I was cast into unknown territory. 

I waited, weighing my options against one another - but the more I turned them over, the more my plan came apart, as if held together by the cheapest glue logic could buy.  Looking back, it's clear that I slipped into the worst anxiety spiral I had experienced for years, but at the time it was nothing so simple.  What would I have actually done if Sophie had answered?  Ran to her?  I'd have no way of knowing if it was her or the imitation, and I could be running into a death trap, or worse.  And if had been Harriet who answered...  what the hell was I planning on saying?  "Sophie told me you were dead - also, have you seen her lately, and are you sure it's actually her?"  At some point I felt like the conversation had been clear in my head, scripted word-for-word through a dozen different outcomes, but everything suddenly felt so blurry and uncertain.  Sweat flooded my face.  The road in front of me seemed to stretch on forever, shrinking to nothing.  What was I hoping to gain from being here?  The steering wheel pulsed, swelling along with the rest of the car interior.  I felt like I was being crushed, running out of space and air.  _Why was I here?_  I fought for breaths that wouldn't come.  I fumbled and failed to open the window, painted the inside of the car door with vomit and passed out.

I blinked back into consciousness to the dull thump of a car door closing. 

The police were leaving, and I could make out the silhouette of another figure on the back seat, a silhouette with shoulder-length hair.  This wasn't Harriet, who wore her perpetual pixie-cut with pride.  My heart leapt as a thought took over my bleary mind - _that could be Sophie, she could be safe_ - but on the other hand, it could be not-Sophie, the imitation.  She could have been staying at Harriet's house to ambush me, knowing I would return to track down my real wife, waiting just inside like an eager spider. 

If that were the case..  then the danger had gone, whisked away in the back of a police car.  Either Sophie was safe... or the danger had gone. 

I had to go inside. 

The oppressive brightness of the day had finally given way to evening gloom.  A handful of keen street lights had judged it dark enough to activate.  Most were holding higher standards, waiting for nightfall proper.  They would not be waiting long; the darkness was drawing in. 

A breeze struck me as I left the car, cutting deeper through my saturated shirt.  I caught a glimpse of myself in the wing mirror, a corpse clad in a Pollock canvas of puke and blood.  Would Sophie even recognise me like this?  No matter.  All I could think about was finding her, or finding evidence of what had happened to her.  While there was still a chance she was alive, I had to try.  I had to go inside.  I had to. 

The house sat detached from its neighbours, identical buildings with identical lawns and driveways.  Aside from their numbers, and the odd flourish of coloured curtains laid by particularly daring residents, there was nothing to tell them apart - as was the way with many of these new-build estates.  It was, of course, the interior that mattered, where the mask gave way to truth. 

The street was graveyard-quiet as I flanked Harriet's house.  A side gate led to the back garden, barely waist height, and unlocked.  Dark blinds obscured all the windows, not a glimmer of light shining through.  The place was empty, as far as I could tell.  None of the windows were open.  I pondered the best way to approach entry, and on a whim, tried the back door with the weight of my shoulder...  it clicked open and I stumbled inside, my knee landing hard on the tiled kitchen floor with a resounding thump. 

A hiss of pain escaped, and I reflexively clamped my palm over my mouth.  The house was dead quiet in response.  Pain was shooting through my leg as I hauled myself up to feebly lean against the countertop.  I pulled out my phone, turned on the torch light and cast it around the room, the beam shaking as I fought to keep my hand steady. 

Just a kitchen.  Oven, microwave, fridge covered with tacky magnets.  Kettle, toaster.  Dirty dishes.  A vase of flowers, a few days past their prime.  Regular old kitchen, nothing unexpected.  Eerie in the stark spotlight, but just a kitchen.  I took a deep breath, and continued into the house. 

The stairway banister cast prison-bar shadows up the wall as I passed.  I swept the torchlight around the living room and bathroom without gleaning much information, and then I saw the door. 

Set into the staircase, this door either led to a cupboard... or a basement. 

I swallowed with all the ease of ingesting a golf ball.  If this house held secrets, my gut told me they would be found here. 

I opened the door.  There were stairs, and they went down.  My light spilled into the narrow space, barely lighting the bottom of the passage, but enough to show me Sophie. 

She was standing there in the darkness, in the same green dress she'd worn when I last saw her.  Her hair was its usual wavy mess.  Her back was toward me, but when she noticed the light, she turned.  It was a sluggish movement, as if she was dazed.  Her gaze met the lower stairs and followed them upwards.  Her eyes widened as she saw me.  She raised an arm, pointed directly at me, took a deep, deliberate breath, and screamed. 

She screamed at me, her finger extended.  A screeching fry of a scream - someone being burned alive, put through a faulty autotune.  It wavered, crackled.  In the poor light, her facial features seemed to distort with her voice. 

She screamed that horrific scream; and as she screamed, she fell apart into bugs. 

She collapsed into them, as if her entire form dissolved into particles from head to toe, only those particles had legs and wings.  Some fell to the floor, crawling and writhing.  Others took to the air.  In a matter of seconds she became a swarm, and then the swarm started up the stairs toward me. 

I was already running, my skin crawling and jolts running down my spine.  What I had witnessed defied explanation, but I wasn't about to hang around and ask questions.  Moth wings brushed the back of my neck, and I knew the spiders wouldn't be far behind. 

I sped around the front of the house, heading for my rental car, but stopped dead. 

The pitch of night was pierced by glares from across the street.  Open doorways, spilling light, each silhouetting a single figure.  Four of them... Five.  No, six.  The neighbourhood had stirred, and they were watching from their doors, standing as still and uniform as their houses.  I blinked, somehow taken aback more by this than the bugs. 

Three more figures were standing by the car, between me and my escape. 

Tiny legs brushed up my shins, the first of the swarm flowing over the top of my socks.  I yelped, kicking out as I took off in a flailing sprint down the street, swatting at moths as they dived in front of my face. 

Through the haze of wings I saw the neighbours in their doorways, each lit from behind like in some 50s alien abduction movie.  Each of them raised an arm, each pointed at me.  Each one echoed the same screech of a scream as I passed them. 

Door after door was the same.  Ten houses.  Fourteen.  Twenty?  I lost count.  Pointed fingers and piercing screams, ringing in my head.  On and on, silhouettes and screams, as if the whole world had conspired toward my exile. 

Tears streaked my face as I ran, longer and harder than I felt I ever had.  The cloud of bugs seemed to thin.  The road led to a forest path, which I took without a second thought.  The promise of darkness was far more alluring than the lights I was leaving behind. 

I knew I had been seen entering the forest, so I deliberately took a difficult and unpredictable path.  I emerged, seemingly a lifetime later, on a quieter street.  I was battered and bruised, I was scratched and torn but I was still breathing, and I didn't stop running until I had put three more roads between myself and the madness. 

Reason finally took over from panic as I leaned against a lamppost to catch my breath in the night's frigid embrace.  I couldn't rely on picking up a trail from Harriet's house.  Whatever this was, it had spread through the whole neighbourhood.  It could replicate people, and the entities they became were capable of working together, coordinating wordlessly.  I didn't know whether the Sophie I saw whisked away by the police was the original or another copy.  If it was not-Sophie, I didn't know if the police officers were still human or not, and if they were, I didn't know how long that would remain the case.  I needed time, I needed to be away from here, and most importantly I needed medical attention. 

I made the most important phone call of my life, and requested to be sectioned in a mental hospital. 

I told them I had an anxiety disorder, had been away from my medication for days, and I explained everything I had seen tonight.  I explained that _of course, I know none of this could have been real_, and yet I still saw it all.  I said that I needed help, and more than anything, that I needed to be isolated. 

My greatest act of deception was to claim that I knew I was mad. 

I have been treated well since I arrived.  I have my own room, and since I am here on a voluntary basis, I still have my phone and internet access.  There are communal areas, which I don't use.  I can leave whenever I want.  I don't. 

I requested a de-worming medication, and was given some sickly banana-flavoured syrup.  They won't allow me the dosage I want, but this is better than nothing.  I haven't noticed any worms in what I bring up, and I still feel like death, but I'll persist.  The nosebleeds still come, but now I can shower and keep myself clean. 

They bring me strong antipsychotics, they bring me tranquillisers.  I thank the staff, and then I hide them. 

I have been feeling safe here.  The past few weeks have practically breezed by.  The horrors I lived through could almost have been a dream. 

Each night, moths gather at my window.  They flock to the pane, as if adhering to a massive bulb.  Dozens of the creatures, crawling over one another, flexing their wings. 

And in the movements of those wings, from their shifting formations, her face.

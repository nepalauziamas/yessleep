My friend Elissa and I have been close since birth– literally. We were born on the same day, in the same hospital, just minutes apart. Our mothers met in the ER one chilly September night, giving birth separated by nothing but a shabby curtain. The hospital’s maternity wing was already overcrowded– did you know September is the most common birth month? Bonded by excruciating pain, long labor, and husbands who had no idea how to help, our moms hit it off. Upon realizing they were both having girls, they decided to exchange phone numbers. Maybe we’d play someday, they thought.

And play we did. Some of my first memories are of Elissa on our couch, Elissa tormenting my childhood cat (Kevin the orange tabby), Elissa with ice cream all over her face. All of our family vacations were joint events; whenever I look at an old scrapbook, it’s impossible to find a solo photo of me. Elissa hanging off my arm at Disneyland. Elissa and I, tiny, hugging either side of an enormous Redwood tree. Us in matching Yosemite shirts, us chasing a seagull at the beach, our identical shades of sunburn at sleepaway camp.

When we started school, everyone thought we were sisters. The inseparable brunettes, the ones who seemed to speak a secret language. We always had the same haircut– not because we picked them out together, but because Elissa’s mom would cut her hair, and I, jealous, would beg my mom for the same style. We could’ve been mistaken for twins until middle school, when Elissa got tall and I stayed tiny. That’s also about when she decided to dye her hair and I decided to grow out my bangs.

We stayed close, even as our interests and styles grew apart. Elissa was very into the “emo” aesthetic, drowning her middle school sorrows in the music of My Chemical Romance. I, on the other hand, had chosen theater as my elective, and was devoting all my time to getting as much attention as possible. We found ways to make it work. We learned makeup together– Elissa focused on finding eyeliner as dark as her soul, I focused on shimmery lip gloss that I thought could catch a boy’s eye.

Even through high school, as it became clear that we had nothing in common anymore, Elissa and I had sleepovers almost every week, carpooled to school daily, and always showed up for each other’s events. If Fall Out Boy was in town, we were going to the concert together. And if I had the lead in the school musical, Elissa was front row with a bouquet, though she was never shy to tell me how much the showtunes grated her ears.

College, then, became the one hurdle our friendship couldn’t overcome. I wanted to stay on the west coast. Elissa had become obsessed with the idea of a small school in New England, studying the classics in a gloomy library. I wanted to read lecture notes on the beach, she wanted to read them in a snowstorm. We promised to stay in touch, but, finally separated for the first time in our lives, forced to branch out, we both ended up meeting people who actually shared interests with us. I assume Elissa found the same comradery in New York, because by the second semester of Freshman year, we were both taking multiple days to reply to each other’s Facebook messages. It hadn’t helped that she’d stayed at school over winter break, citing how expensive plane tickets were.

When she did end up coming back to California for a few weeks of summer, we both knew something irreplaceable had been lost. We were excited to see each other, obviously, and we spent a long time catching each other up on how school had been, the people we’d met, the crazy shenanigans we’d gotten up to.

But at a certain point, the conversation just… died. Once we’d told each other every story, we had nothing else to talk about. It hit me that we no longer had anything in common. We used to spend hours speculating about what our futures together might look like. Now, the future was here, and we were further apart than we ever predicted.

We stayed in touch, even when it stopped coming from a place of genuine curiosity about each other’s lives and started being a chore. I even flew east for Elissa’s graduation, and met all the friends who, before then, were just names on a screen. They were colder than I’d imagined them, and they didn’t really like me, though Elissa swore they were just awkward around new people. “Give them a chance, Grace, they’ll warm up to you.”

But their attitude didn’t seem “awkward.” It seemed calculated. Like Elissa had joined an elite club of goth-ish academics who immediately sensed when someone wasn’t cool enough to walk beside them. And in my pale pink thrifted dress and butterfly hair clips at age 22, I didn’t make the cut. When we went out for drinks, they kept going off to the bathroom together, and I’ll never know for sure, but I swear they were leaving to make fun of me.

I tried not to let it get to me. The more I thought about it, I realized that my new friends probably wouldn’t like Elissa very much, either, though she didn’t come to my graduation, so I’ll never really know. But they’d probably think she was creepy, or pretentious.

But no matter how much I told myself not to be offended, I still felt a shift after Elissa dropped me off at the airport in Newark. And a few months later, our communication just sort of… ended. We both had to focus on the terror of post-college grad, finding jobs, figuring out places to live– one day I realized that I hadn’t heard from Elissa recently, and I felt no compulsion to reach out.

So, our lives together came to a close. Heartbreaking, but not unusual. It was actually sort of miraculous that a childhood friendship lasted so long.

We still supported each other from a distance. I saw on Facebook that she was going back to school for a PHD, focused on ancient religions. Meanwhile, I was working as a yoga instructor in west Hollywood, trying to get an agent. I was proud of her. It felt like she was actually doing something with her life, trying to advance research in an underappreciated field. I was just some actress with a dream, like so many thousands of others.

I saw Elissa again a few times after that, when she’d occasionally visit home. We’d grab food together, catch up, always polite, never bringing up anything real. We both sensed, I think, that the closeness we’d had as kids would never come back. Eventually, she became so engrossed in research for her PHD that she couldn’t make the trip out west without interrupting her work, and I never had a reason to go to the east coast.

The last time I saw Elissa was at my wedding. I was honestly surprised when she RSVP’d. Expecting her to be busy with research, I didn’t offer her a place in the bridal party, which I was embarrassed about once Elissa confirmed that she was coming. Here was this girl I’d known since the day I was born, and she’d be sitting in the audience at my wedding while a woman I’d been teaching yoga with for two years gave a toast.

But when Elissa actually *arrived* at the wedding, I instantly knew I’d made the right choice. Something was wrong about her. I assumed it was the stress of her PHD– she’d been working on it for years now, though I couldn’t remember how many. I don’t know how long a PHD is supposed to take, but I know she’d been at it for longer than that. My wedding ceremony was on a characteristically warm autumn day in California, and Elissa arrived 30 minutes late, right as we finished the vows, wearing a long dark gown with a pearl-laden headpiece. Darker than the dress were the circles under her eyes, which shone through under her layers of pale foundation.

At the reception, she apologized for her lateness. When I commented on her attire, she smiled sheepishly, saying she’d forgotten how hot it was in October in California, and that the gown was a part of her research. She remarked that it seemed everything had something to do with her research these days. She was twitchy and odd for the remainder of the night, refusing alcohol, staying to the edges of the gathering. She wasn’t even really interested in meeting my husband or my friends. She seemed to be studying us, not one of us. When I did occasionally try to talk with her, we couldn’t exchange more than a few sentences without her bringing up Slavic paganism, fringe cults, attempted unification; things I couldn’t hope to understand, much less engage in deep conversation about.

My most striking memory of her that night is when I asked where she’d be staying after the festivities, if she’d be going back to her parent’s house, telling her to wish them well for me. Elissa shook her head bitterly. “We’re not in contact anymore,” she said. “They stopped approving of my research.”

I had no idea what to say to that, but I think I managed something sympathetic before walking away to find George (husband). Elissa was no longer a person I could understand in any way. Watching how she wandered the edges of my wedding in her dark gown, still so much taller than me, evoked the thought of a vampire more than a friend.

I didn’t invite her to the baby shower a year later. She didn’t comment on the Facebook post about it. In fact, she had stopped posting on Facebook at all. Her profile sat empty, unused. I convinced myself she’d return once her PHD was done. George and I welcomed Glinda into the world, then Gavin just last year. Grace and George and Glinda and Gavin, a full family of G’s. Some people think it’s tacky, but I’ve always loved having a unifying chord that runs through my family. George is an engineer at a software company. I quit the yoga studio, though I’m still close with people who work there. I get to be a stay-at-home mom for the early years of my kids’ lives, something that’s always been a dream of mine. Elissa, conversely, always swore she’d never have kids.

Watching my kids grow, I think of Elissa surprisingly often. Glinda and Gavin’s petty squabbles evoke Elissa and I fighting over her Easy Bake Oven, and whenever I take the kids somewhere new (Disney, Yosemite, all the California sights), I see Elissa everywhere, remembering how we’d screamed on It’s a Small World, how our mothers forced us to pose in front of El Capitan.

Then, the message. It was a late night ealier this year, and I was rocking a crying Gavin. I was looking on Facebook for a link that a friend had sent me to a sensory video that always knocks Gavin out. Suddenly, as I scrolled, Gavin’s ear-splitting cries were interrupted by the ping of a new message. Elissa, after all these years. It read:

*Hi Grace!* 

*It’s been a little while! I’m sorry I haven’t reached out, but I’ve been so busy I haven’t had much time to get online. This is going to sound crazy, but hear me out– how would you like to go to Europe with me this summer? My PHD advisor has been telling me for years that my research is still missing a key piece, something that connects my hypothesis to the known facts, and I’ve realized that I’m never going to find what I need in a library. I need to go search for myself. I was going to bring Amber (one of my friends from my graduation, if you can remember that far back!) because her research aligns with mine in a lot of ways, and we even bought the plane tickets, but she realized she’s speaking at a symposium that week.* 

*All of this to say, the plane and hotel are all booked and paid for, I’m just missing someone to come with me! It would be late this June, the 20th to the 30th. And it won’t all just be boring research, I promise; I have to hike to various sites that ancient peoples thought to be holy places. I know we’ve both changed a lot since we were kids, but I remember you always being up for a hike in a beautiful place. I hope you still are.* 

*You might be wondering why I’ve asked you of all people to come with me– to be honest, I miss you a lot. I know we haven’t seen each other since your wedding. I looked through your photos before reaching out, and saw that you have kids now! That’s amazing! They’re adorable, but how could they not be? They have your genes. These past few years, as I’ve gone deeper into my research, I’ve started really regretting the people I lost along the way, and your name is at the top of that list, Grace. It’s my fault we don’t talk anymore. You’re the one with kids and a husband to distract you. I’ve just been lazy. We spent the first 18 years of our lives as close as two people can be. I miss it. Or rather, I miss you. I know you probably feel like our friendship is over– that’s definitely something I’ve felt. But it doesn’t have to be. I still hold as much love for you as I ever did. And if you’re willing, I’d love to reconnect, hopefully in Europe this June. Please let me know if you have any questions, and take as much time as you need to think about it! But I’d be honored to have you there.*

A million thoughts flew through my head at once. What a sweet message! No way I can go to Europe, I have two toddlers to take care of. Well, it’s only ten days. Maybe George could take off work. I’ve always wanted to see Europe! No, there’s no way I can go, I barely know Elissa anymore. What if we ran out of things to talk about on the first day? But how could we, when we’re seeing totally new sights at every moment? Oh God, I’ve never taken a flight that long. But I really want to go. No, I can’t. But I have to. And it’s free! But I shouldn’t!

Two days later, after a long talk with George, I accepted Elissa’s offer. I was nervous, but excited by the prospect of reigniting my friendship with someone who’d been so important for so much of my life. She responded enthusiastically, and we spent the next few months discussing the details, my flight to meet her in New York, our joint flight to Slovenia, our hotel, our hikes, what I should pack, and just general sentiments about how elated we were to be making this trip together.

I still had nerves, obviously, but as I packed my bags and prepared a list for George of what he needed to do for the kids each day, all I could feel was relief at the impending break from my life. Don’t get me wrong; I love my family, and I love being a mother, and I wouldn’t give it up for anything in the world. But when little Gavin is throwing his fifth tantrum of the week because I won’t let him eat a battery, I think anyone could understand that I needed a break.

On the morning of June 19th, I kissed my babies and husband goodbye, and set off for parts unknown. The plan was to stay at a hotel in Manhattan for the night with Elissa so we could catch our flight to Slovenia bright and early the next day. I had suggested staying at her place rather than a hotel, but she flatly turned me down, stating that we’d have to wake up far too early to catch our flight if we were leaving from her place. I tried to tell her I didn’t mind, but she was insistent that a hotel was the better option. She was insistent about many things on the trip– she’d even requested I bring some specific items of clothing so I could model for photos of the religious sites we’d be visiting. “So my PHD Advisor can get an idea of scale,” she’d said.

When Elissa and I met up, she somehow looked even more haggard than she had at my wedding. Skinnier, more exhausted, and I think her posture had gotten worse (probably from slumping over a desk) though she still towered over me. Out of politeness, I didn’t comment on it. She was wearing another long gown, like at my wedding, and a beautiful wrap over her hair. She looked like she’d stepped out of the middle ages. “Is this dress part of your research?”

“Yeah, I’ve been studying sewing techniques and patterns from the time period,” Elissa confirmed. “I like the way it fits on me.” To me, the gown only emphasized Elissa’s worrying thinness and unusually tall height. But I smiled, telling her it looked great. I was just glad to see her.

That night at the hotel, Elissa wanted to sleep early, so we didn’t talk much, but I did show her some photos of my kids, which she seemed to like, and in return she showed me photos of she and her friends. I recognized a lot of them from her college, though I couldn’t put names to the faces anymore. In all the photos, everyone seemed to be wearing the same sort of historical gowns that Elissa now wore. “I guess this is what you meant about having similar research!” I remarked.

Elissa’s eyebrows scrunched in confusion. “What?”

“Your friend Amber? You said you have similar research? So I guess you’re all really into the middle ages, and stuff.”

Her face returned to a mask of neutrality. “Oh, that. Yeah, we are. Got into it in school. Haven’t gotten out of it yet.”

Elissa’s tone weirded me out. Shouldn’t she have some kind of excitement about this? It was the thing she’d been researching for close to a decade at this point. It seemed like devoting her life to it had sucked out the joy. I felt bad for her. In my mind, I assumed it was a sunk-cost fallacy deal: she didn’t care about all of this stuff anymore, but she’d spent so long trying to get her PHD, it seemed impossible to give up now. I made a silent promise with myself that I would spend this entire trip doing everything I could to show her a good time.

It wasn’t easy. The next day, as I tried to suggest movies we could watch together on the flight, Elissa insisted on poring over her many books about Slavic paganism, telling me there were just a few things she needed to look over again before we landed. I tried to read over her shoulder to see what she was up to, but the books were all in different languages, none of which I could read. I commented on my surprise at how many languages Elissa knew, and she just said something offhand about, “yes, well, I got tired of reading translations.”

The Slovenian landscape was beautiful as we touched down. My body was telling me it was the middle of the night, but due to the time difference, it was still light in Slovenia. The mountains took my breath away, and through my exhaustion, I felt a twinge of excitement at being in such a gorgeous place. Elissa, on the other hand, looked deep in her own mind. As we deplaned, I heard her mumble something about how “now, the real work begins,” but when I asked her about it she said it wasn’t important.

With only ten days and much to do, Elissa got to work as soon as we arrived at our hotel room, planning a visit to a library nearby. She had a long list of things to look for, books she couldn’t find in the United States. I meant to accompany her, but jet lag caught up to me, and I dozed off while Elissa was getting ready to head out. When I woke again, it was dark outside our windows, and Elissa was in the bed across from me with a mountain of text. She wore an elaborate nightgown, and her hair was tightly fastened to her head in complex braids. “Go back to sleep,” she whispered, “we’re hiking once the sun’s up.”

And so began our Slovenian adventure. By day, we hiked, by night, Elissa read. I knew she must be sleeping at some point, but I never saw it. She tried to explain her research to me, to help me grasp the point of all of this, but most of it went over my head. All I really know, even now, is that before Christianity stepped in, Slavic people had their own distinct Gods they believed in. Apparently, the Slovenians along the Soca (a river we always hiked towards) were the last people to practice this form of paganism, keeping the old beliefs alive until the 14th century when the Christians got them, too. Elissa’s PHD hypothesis revolved around a specific goddess, some sort of earth-mother. It was hard to prove her theories, she told me, because in addition to normal temples (of which there were plenty of artifacts left behind), Slavic paganism also centered holy sites with no buildings, sites of untouched nature that the worshippers believed they could feel the presence of the Gods in.

Elissa told me much more, but our gaps in understanding were so huge, I don’t remember a lot of it. She spoke at such length and with such clarity, it started to feel like all of this was a religion she actively practiced rather than beliefs that died hundreds of years ago.

We an odd pair on hiking trails, her in her gowns, me in the white linen she’d requested I bring. She photographed me at sites, as promised, and would sometimes have me pose. I always agreed eagerly, happy I could help her in some way despite not understanding her academic pursuits. But as the days went on, the poses got increasingly strange. Once, she blindfolded me and bound my hands in a circle of stones, explaining that human sacrifice was common in ancient days, and she was dressing me as one such unlucky offering. Another time, I was asked to lie down, and she dropped a handful of dirt on my chest, whispering something under her breath. When I flinched, she laughed, saying she was just recreating a diagram she’d seen in one of her new library books.

I had doubts about what Elissa was doing, but I kept them to myself. I didn’t feel I had room to be ungrateful. After all, she was paying for all of this. I explained everything away in my own mind.

One of the first days, I noticed that even though Elissa was doing all of this research, working so hard, I never actually saw her take a note. She had no pencils, no notebook, no laptop. I wasn’t even sure she had a phone. On our hikes, she took pictures with a digital camera.

She remarked that she wasn’t very into technology, once, as an offhand comment. That startled me. When I’d known her, she’d been the most tech savvy person I knew. She’s the one who pushed me to make a Facebook. She taught me how to illegally download music. When had she become a luddite?

Elissa also mentioned her friends quite often, but the things she said upset me deeply. When a normal person has a common interest with friends, and they’re on a trip exploring that interest, they might say, oh, my friend so-and-so is going to love this! Instead, Elissa would talk about her friends like they were her boss at work, remarking that she needed to figure this out or needed to go to this place, or her friends would be furious. Between their apparently tense relationships and matching gowns, I started to get a bad feeling that something deeper was going on with Elissa’s “friend group.”

We had been in Slovenia for five days when we had an incident that I couldn’t explain away. Up until that point, I always told myself that Elissa was just eccentric, that she’d been around the same people for so long that she had trouble interacting normally, that it was normal to be so engrossed in something you care about. But on June 25th, we were at a holy site. When we arrived, Elissa gasped out loud, saying the place was “perfect.” For what, she didn’t mention. To me, it looked just like the four other riverside grass patches we’d already studied. But, seeing how important it was to Elissa, I encouragingly said, “This is going to be great for your PHD!”

She turned to me with a wide smile. “Forget that nonsense, this goes way beyond that!”

I went cold. “Nonsense? You’ve been working on it for years!”

Elissa shook her head. “Right. Yeah, my PHD. Of course.”

But as she looked around the clearing, measuring it, confirming something or other to be symmetrical, it didn’t look like she was worried about a dissertation.

We came back to the same place the next day. This time, Elissa brought a suitcase full of items. She didn’t let me look at any of it until we arrived. She told me to lay down in the center of the clearing with my hands clasped on my stomach. I complied. I didn’t even struggle as she bound my wrists and ankles together– it wasn’t crazier than any of the other poses she’d had me do.

But as I waited, I didn’t hear any camera shutter click. “Aren’t you going to take a photo for your PHD advisor?” I lightly prompted.

Elissa was silent.

“Elissa?” I asked.

“I’m sorry.” She quietly replied.

It was at that exact moment that I realized I was in the woods with a near complete stranger, wearing strange clothes, and tied up. I struggled against the restraints, but they were tight. Elissa, maybe in an attempt to calm me, said, “relax, I’m just getting some things set up.”

I asked her what was going on. She was silent again, but I heard rustling in her bag. I had to crane my head to see what she was doing. From my angle, I saw her pulling out jewelry, books, and white smooth objects that it took me a moment to register as bones. I was officially freaking out.

“Untie me!” I yelled.

“This will be easier if you calm down.” Elissa replied.

“What are you doing!”

“Research.” She said calmly. “Don’t you want to help?”

I finally had to accept that it wasn’t just her being smarter than me, or me not listening hard enough, there was actually something incomprehensible going on here, and I no longer knew if I was safe with Elissa. “What am I helping you with?!”

“You’re helping me more than anyone ever has.”

“With your PHD?” I quietly questioned. I felt tears beginning to blur the edges of my vision.

She was silent. She started arranging the items from her bag around me in concentric circles. I kept spouting off questions, but she ignored me, engrossed in her task. I saw her consulting her books once or twice, too. No matter what I shouted at her, what I begged to know, she acted like I wasn’t there. Until finally, I yelled, “Are you and your friends a cult?!”

When I said that, she slammed her book shut, promptly walked over to me, and placed her foot on my stomach, pressing down *hard*. I cried out in pain. She pushed down harder. “Don’t fucking call us that.”

Through my agony, I tried to reason with her. “Whatever they told you to do, you don’t have to do it.”

“Nobody told me to do anything,” she insisted fiercely. “This is for me, and me alone. This is my way out. And I’m not letting you fuck it up.”

She finally removed her foot. I was sobbing. I rolled to my side, curling into a ball, my body instinctively trying to protect my bruised abdomen. I think I mumbled the world “please” a few times, but if I did, Elissa either didn’t hear me or didn’t care. She continued her “preparations.” I lay still, afraid she’d hurt me again, wishing for this to just be over.

After a long time, she sat down a few yards from me. We breathed for a moment. I finally asked, “What do you mean it’s your way out?”

Elissa was silent for a solid thirty seconds, and I thought she was going to refuse to answer me yet again. But then, she sighed. “Fine. It doesn’t matter. We have time to kill before the sun sets, anyways.”

“What happens when the sun sets?” I asked in alarm.

Elissa stood over me. “Do you want to hear the story, or do you want to keep asking pointless questions?”

This time, it was me who fell silent. Elissa cleared her throat.

“When I moved across the country, I had trouble fitting in,” she began. “Turns out, a lot of the kids at my school knew each other already. It was a small college, which I knew. I thought it would be like a dark academia novel.” Elissa laughed bitterly after that, which did nothing to soothe my nerves. “Well, after a few months of loneliness, I met my friends. Amber was the leader, of sorts. They had all been friends in highschool– private school, of course– and had chosen this college together specifically because of its incredibly reputable theology department. I wasn’t religious. You know that. It’s just not how you and I were raised. But they swore to me that what they believed in wasn’t some fake Christian bullshit, it was older than that. And it was *real*. Over winter break, they were all going to Amber’s family’s lakehouse in Maine. They said they’d show me the truth.”

“You never told me about any of this. You didn’t mention it in your messages.” I timidly prodded.

“I wanted to see it through before I told anybody.” Elissa explained. “I thought if I kept it from you, then it would be a really funny story to tell the next time we saw each other. Like, oh, Grace, you’ll never believe this, I tricked these girls into thinking I believed in this crazy pagan religion and they had me participate in a wild ritual at a super fancy lakehouse. My only conception of pagan religion was the Greeks. I thought we’d spend the break running naked through the woods, drinking wine.”

Elissa’s voice got dark. “It wasn’t like that. First of all, the lakehouse was in the middle of nowhere. We had to hike off a dirt road to get there. It was much smaller than I thought it would be. When we finally found the place, we put our stuff down, then Amber went outside with a shovel. She started digging right by the lake shore. The lake was frozen, and so was the ground. The girls had to rotate who was digging, because it was so hard to get anywhere in the tough, cold dirt. Finally, we hit a burlap sack, and then went back to the house to spill the contents. It was full of bones. ‘Past sacrifices,’ one of the girls told me. ‘The more you use in the ritual circle, the more power you can harness.’ I was freaked, but the bones were all animals, so I figured it must be okay. Besides, what was I going to do, leave? We’d all driven up together. I had nowhere to go.

“Someone explained that Mokosh is the goddess of water, that’s why they stored the bones by the lake, to enhance their connection to her. That’s the first time I heard her name. Mokosh. The deity we were all there to worship. It maybe should’ve startled me more that our next move was to grab Amber’s father’s gun from the fireplace, but at this point, the girls could’ve done anything, and I would’ve just had to accept it.

“We walked off into the woods. The girls were drinking, but not wine, like I’d dreamed– swigs of vodka, straight from a flask. ‘Have some,’ one of them said, ‘it’ll keep you warm on the hunt.’ We wandered off into the trees. When we finally found a deer, it was me who was commanded to shoot it. ‘You’re the initiate,’ Amber told me, ‘so you have to secure your own sacrifice.’ I had never shot a gun before. Amber was behind me, guiding my hand. We aimed for the deer’s backside, trying to keep it from running, not to kill it. Probably because of Amber’s steady hand, my first shot hit. I was shaking the entire time, of course.

“We dragged the deer back towards the house. Well, the girls did. I was too freaked to touch it. Amber was very sympathetic. ‘You’ll get used to this part,’ she assured me. They dragged the struggling deer out on the frozen lake. Its blood stained the ice. I was asked to hold the deer down while the girls arranged the other bones in circles around it.”

At that moment I realized. I gasped. Then, louder than ever, I screamed, praying someone would hear me. Elissa straddled me, holding me down, covering my mouth with her hands. She was so much taller than me, and, despite her skinny appearance, incredibly strong. “Shut up!” She commanded. Tears streaming down my face, I tried to bite her hands. She pushed harder. My hair was pressing into the mud. We were close enough to the river that the ground was soft. By water– a place of power. The bones she was taking from the bag– the past sacrifices. Me– the deer.

Elissa took an elaborately carved knife from somewhere in her gown. She pressed it to my throat. Then, and only then, was I silent. “I don’t want to do this.” She told me. “But I have to. I have to get away from them. And for that, I need to make a sacrifice large enough that the Goddess releases me from her service.”

“I have two babies,” I pleaded. “Please don’t kill me. Please.”

As I looked at her, I saw that Elissa, too, was beginning to cry. “I don’t want to,” Elissa assured me, “but the longer you’ve known someone, the more powerful of a sacrifice they are. And you’ve known me longer than anyone, Grace. Since *birth*.”

“Can’t you just stay with the goddess?” I cried. “Why do you need to get out so badly?!”

With a sudden jerking motion, she sat me up. I looked around me. The bones that surrounded me were human. Hundreds and hundreds of human bones, all the way to the edges of the clearing. Skulls, spines, hips. Some were brown with age, some were bright white, like Halloween decorations. But I knew they were all real. Some were cracked, some broken in half, and I vividly remember a hand with all the fingers cut at the knuckles, which made me want to throw up. It *all* made me want to throw up. I was going to end up among them? “The price is too much.” Elissa whispered. “I can’t do it anymore. I can’t. I won’t. When I sacrifice you, it’ll be over. You’re saving so many lives, Grace.”

She pushed me back down. She no longer had the knife on me. Maybe I should’ve struggled. But I was catatonic, too horrified to move. Water still poured from my eyes. Elissa’s tears joined mine on my white linen dress. The one she’d asked me to wear. She’d been planning this all along. She paid for my trip to Europe so she could *kill me*. Even if I managed to escape this, I was now sure there was no return ticket to America in my name. I kept seeing Glinda and Gavin’s faces. Children who would grow up with no mother. Children who would never even know what happened to her. George would probably think I left him with no explanation. Elissa, above me, told me not to cry, kept telling me this was for the greater good.

I screwed my eyes shut. I couldn’t look at her. Elissa turned to her books. Making sure everything was right, I guess. The sun was beginning to set. I cried harder, knowing what that meant for me. I was going to die, murdered by my best friend, in a country who’s language I didn’t even speak, for a Goddess who I doubted existed. “Was there ever a PHD?” I whispered.

“At the beginning, yes,” Elissa assured me. “When I met Mokosh for the first time, that night at the lake, I didn’t believe it. I thought I had hallucinated, maybe, or that my friends had put something in the vodka. I wanted to understand what I’d seen, what I’d done, to explain it rationally. The girls encouraged me, but not because they wanted to understand– because they wanted to show the world. They wanted me to prove Mokosh’s power, irrefutably.”

“When did it stop being a PHD?”

“When I got in too deep.” Came Elissa’s hurried reply. “That first night, as the girls explained it, I entered a bond with Mokosh. And with them. I was part of their temple now, and we had to keep giving Mokosh gifts so we would have her favor. Her favor gave us things– anything we wanted, practically. And that was good for a while. We asked for money.”

“And strength.” I feebly supplied, remembering how painful that boot had been on my stomach.

“Strength, yes. Intelligence. Memory. The ability to never forget. To not sleep. New languages. But in order to keep our new abilities, Mokosh always demanded more. We only killed animals, for a while. But it stopped being enough.”

“So you started killing people.”

“I had no choice!” Elissa quickly insisted. “I didn’t want to do it! They forced me to do it, so we could keep our gifts! And I can’t run from them– they always know where I am! And if they don’t, Mokosh tells them! Because of the *bond*. The stupid bond.”

The sun was almost fully set. “What about at my wedding? Were you working on the PHD then? Or were you already lying to me?”

Elissa went silent. It was just as damning as if she’d answered. After a feeble moment, she said, again, “I’m sorry, Grace. I’m so sorry.”

The sun dipped below the horizon. Elissa took the knife she had threatened me with earlier and slashed the center of her hand, dripping her blood onto me, and the ground around me. It reminded me of the dirt she’d suddenly dumped on my chest a few days prior. Had she been… practicing?

She started speaking a language I couldn’t understand. She circled me. I noticed that she was now wearing the jewelry that had come out of her bag earlier. Did she have to be adorned to communicate with her precious goddess? And her strange gowns were part of it, no question. I sobbed helplessly. Why even try and figure it all out now? I knew, with absolute certainty, that my life was over.

With a sudden motion, she leaned close to me, slitting the linen dress down the middle. Now, my skin was fully bare, ripe to be cut, I thought hopelessly. Elissa was still speaking that strange language, chanting, and I heard Mokosh’s name. It was all so ridiculous, if anyone else had been tied up here, if I’d been watching it on TV, I might have laughed.

Elissa pressed her knife tip between my collarbones, and I flinched. She used one hand to hold me still– one hand, that’s all it took, she was that strong. She pulled the knife down, carving along my sternum as I screamed in pain. “Just get it over with!” I cried.

And then, there she was.

At the edge of my vision (which was going blurry) I saw a glowing woman. Her hair, bright yellow, was a long wild mane. She wore a gown. She was huge, taller than Elissa, who was always the tallest woman I knew. I knew, immediately, that this must be Mokosh. She was *real*. Elissa drove her knife into me again. I barely felt it. I was mesmerized by the glowing woman who now circled the clearing. When she spoke, it had no language. I heard it in my mind, like one of my own thoughts, but I knew it was her.

“*What is this?*” She asked.

“*My final sacrifice.*” Elissa replied. Was she also speaking in my mind? Was I just dying, and everything sounded strange? I had no idea.

“*You mean to leave my service with such a pathetic offering?*” Mokosh replied. I wasn’t offended– I agreed with her. How pathetic I was under her divine light.

“*She is the one who has known me the longest, my Goddess.*” Elissa emphatically replied. Mokosh circled. Elissa stabbed me yet again. “*See how she bleeds for you.*”

“*This is the best you have?*” Despite the explanation, Mokosh was clearly unimpressed.

“*She and I were born minutes apart, right beside each other. Nearly a twin. A perfect choice. The one who knows me best, just as all the texts said.*”

The goddess began to approach. I had to fight to keep my eyes open. There were cuts all over me now, and I felt my blood seeping into the earth. As she got closer and closer to me, I felt warmth radiating from her. In my blurred vision, I saw her stand beside Elissa. They both looked down on me.

Mokosh moved behind Elissa. “*There’s just one problem, my daughter.*” Mokosh said. “*She doesn’t know you at all.*”

I saw Elissa get taller, then realized she was being raised up. She cried out, “Wait! Stop!” I heard it aloud, not in my mind. Then, when she was quite high up, floating in front of Mokosh, I heard a sickening crunch. Her limbs contorted. She fell limply to the ground, dead, inches from me. My eyes finally shut.

*This is how I die.* I thought.

But then came the second voice. The Goddess. “*It doesn’t have to be.*”

*Mokosh.*

“*You can call me that, if you’d like.*”

*It’s not your name?*

“*It’s what this group of disciples call me. I apologize for this one. She was always weak.*” Rather than consciousness slipping, as I felt it should, I was becoming more alert with each moment, somehow. “*What about you? Are* you *weak?*”

I opened my eyes again. It was easy. Mokosh– whatever she was– stood over me. In one swipe of her hand, she unbound my arms and legs. I went to rub them, but stopped when I realized they weren’t in pain. She’d taken it all.

“*Grace, is it? I see you have children. That takes a lot of strength.*”

I stood, a bit shaky on my feet, but standing firm. “Thank you for saving me.” I said aloud.

“*You’re welcome, my child.*” Now I could see her clearly. She was smiling. “*But my gifts aren’t free, you know.*”

My blood ran cold. “I know.”

She gestured towards Elissa’s destroyed body, which I could now see was bent in every unnatural way. “*I find myself in need of a new disciple. And you’d like to see those children of yours again, wouldn’t you?*”

I gulped. “Yes, I would... Mother.”

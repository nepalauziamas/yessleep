Last week I became a school bus driver. I know, it’s kind of a weird job. But, I needed money and this only takes a couple hours out of my day, and they’re paying 40k a year. I only had to do an online bus driving course and I was ready to go. I was told I had 3 stops, it was simple, pull up, let the kids on, drive them to school. I thought it would be an easy income source while I was looking for an actual job. But, after what’s happened I’m not sure if I can just leave.

Last week I did my first route. At the first stop I pulled up and 8 kids got on. Next stop, 10 kids got on. At the last stop 7 kids got on the bus, or at least I thought. There should have been 25 kids on that bus. But for some reason there was 26. There was a small boy with black eyes staring at the seat in front of him with a black expression. I didn’t remember seeing him get on and I was pretty confused. But I thought  it must’ve been my imagination and I drove them to school. When we arrived all the children got off, except for that boy. He stayed sitting with the same blank expression. I turned to look at the school and when I turned back, he was gone.

When I came to pick them up after the school day had finished again there was 25 kids, and that boy wasn’t there. I looked out the windshield to see if he was walking up but there was no one. When I looked back, there he was, sitting there with the same bored look on his face. I once again assumed I was seeing things and drove all the kids home. At the last stop 7 kids got off of the bus, there was only one left, that boy. At this point I didn’t know what was going on, I though he might’ve been asleep or something. I said to him “Hey buddy, is this your stop?”, I got no response. I tried again “Do you know how to get home?”, again he didn’t acknowledge me. I was started to get annoyed and told him “Listen kid, I’ve got to go home, so please just tell me where you live and I’ll drop you off.”, this time he looked up.

I don’t know how to explain what the feeling was. Terror? Fear? I’m not sure, but those eyes, something about them was very wrong. When he looked in my direction he didn’t look at my face, he only looked at my chest. I felt cold instantly, my ears started ringing and the music on the radio stopped. I froze for what felt like a hour, but I was able to sink into my seat. When I looked back, he was gone.

The next day the same thing happened. When the kid got on he wasn’t there, but when I looked back there he was. When I came time to pick the kids up I decided that I would keep my eyes locked on the seat he always sat in, so I could see how he gets on. While looking I felt that same feeling again, I still can’t describe it, but it made me look away, when I looked back again, he was there. When we got to the stop I waited for all the kids to get off, then, I turned by head back and forth as fast as possible so I only saw him for a split second. Somehow he still vanished.

No matter what I do I can’t find out how he gets on the bus. I’m not sure what to do. I’ll make an update if anything happens.

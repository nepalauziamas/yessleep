It was a wonderful day for traveling. Me, my sister, and my mom decided to go to another country to spend our vacation. To be honest, it wasn't easy for me and my sister to have our schedules aligned because we were both doctors.

I was feeling kind of giddy as it has been a while since I've traveled to another place. After around an hour, we managed to get to the airport. 

Or perhaps I was wrong?

"Hey, are we in the right place?" I asked hesitantly. The place still looks like that its still under construction. It only has its structure, no windows, no furniture, nothing. 

"Yeah we are, that's what it says on the GPS" I would have not believed my sister if there wasn't because of an existing line on the front side of the building. Of course, in order to not be late, me and my family immediately went inside. It was strange not gonna lie.

In the front most part of the line was a free teeth cleaning by a dentist. Seems like the line was for that. On the seat was an old man who seems kind of pissed. I hurriedly looked away when our eyes met. 

We went ahead and tried to find a place to sit while waiting for the flight. However, as I said before. It really didn't have anything inside. Just a water station. I was kind of thirsty so I grabbed a cup and got myself some water. What I didn't expect was a scream of pain that rang through the air. 

It was creepy. I felt the ground shook slightly. That wasn't possible. Must have been my mind playing games with me.

But I guess I was wrong. This time it was real.

Screams from different people reverberated through the air. They sounded like desperate cries. Me and my family ran despite not knowing what was the cause. 

We didn't even want to know what was the cause.

We made it outside where the airplanes land and run through. There we saw a plane letting passengers in, we ran there and the flight attendant let us in immediately. She had a panicked look despite her trying to calm down other passengers. 

Typically, in movies, the move we made was a dumb move.

Well it was a dumb move.

The pilot started the engine and it started to run through the path. I sighed in relief. We were about to escape. I was wrong, again.

I looked at the window, there I saw the old man from the front. His whole body was colored in red. Then he looked up and I felt the chill in my spine. It looked like he was looking at me. I looked away, believing we will be safe now. 

He won't be able to catch an on-going plane and moreover, it was about to fly. It was impossible. It should be. But no, the plane came to a stop. The left side of the plane was destroyed.

Lub dub lub dub. My heart was pounding heavily. I held my mother's and sister's hands and was scared of what was about to happen. 

The old man stepped inside the plane with a creepy grin.

I stood up and immediately ran with my family in tow. Soon enough, another wave of screams of "stop", "no" and "please" came. I was crying. I was scared. I don't know what to do. Me and my family jumped down to the destroyed side of the plane.

It was high, but we didn't want to get killed. We landed receiving slight injuries but due to the adrenaline, we immediately stood and ran again. I looked back. The old man was looking at me. 

Then I fainted.

I woke up with a groan. Where was I? What was I doing?

Then it hit me. The Old man.

I looked at my surroundings immediately. Then right there in the middle. I see the old man standing with various sizes of bloody gifts at his back.

"You woke up! Glad you did, I was scared that you might have not"

I stared in silence. What will he do to me?

"Oh come on now. Don't be scared, I have a gift for you! You can pick anything from here to there!" He says while pointing to the gifts at his back.

Gifts? Those bloodied gifts? What are inside them? 

"Where's my mom and sister?" Ignoring his initial offer.

He stared at me for a good ten seconds and proceeded to look through his "gifts"

"Anyway, I'll pick my gift for you instead cause you don't want to tell me what you want."

When he did pick a gift, he looked back at me and started walking. I couldn't move, I don't know if it was because of the injuries or fear.

"Here" He said with a grin.

I took it because of the fear he might kill me. 

"Come on, open it" 

I slowly opened his gift and I looked at it in horror.

Inside was a pair of hands.

"I call it the loving touch of a mother and daughter!" He said in joy.

I fainted.

Then I woke up again. I was in a hospital bed. "Oh my, that's horrible" A voice said. I looked at where it came from. It was mom. She was looking at the News. There it says a mass murder was done at an airport.

I looked around, there I saw my sister at the sofa.

Oh. 

Good.

It was just a dream.

I looked again at the news and there I see him.

The Old Man in my dream.

He was looking back at the camera. 

As if he was looking at me.

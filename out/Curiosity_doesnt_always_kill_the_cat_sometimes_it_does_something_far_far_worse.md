There was once a girl named maya.

Maya was a curious child, she always doubted her mother when she told her to be wary of the beautiful voices that come from the path that leads to the woods.

‘They’re seductive, don’t trust them, never follow them’ she said. ‘It doesn’t matter how beautiful they sound, never sing back’ she said.

But maya was a curious girl, and one day, it got the best of her…

She walked toward the voices at sunset, claiming to play with her friends.

She heard them louder and louder as she got closer and closer, the closer she got, the weirder the voices became.

At first it was beautiful, otherworldly female voices singing nothing in particular, just humming. Later, as she got closer, it started distorting into a devilish male voice with a nasally hint to it. Maya was in a trance like state and could do nothing but walk closer and closer.

*ring ring ring*

Her phone startled her out of her state, she looked around and realized she was back at the beginning of the path. She answered the phone only to hear her mother’s voice. 

She ran back home, and never told her mother what happened, for she was too afraid.

 The next day, She decided to go to the path once more, trying to see where the voices would lead.

She was drawn closer and closer and closer to the voices, until they began distorting.

“Maya,” the voices sang, “sing with us.”

“But, mommy told be never to sing back..” she replied

“But mommy isn’t here yet, is she?”

“No… okay then.”


And so she did. She sang and sang, until her voice began matching theirs, 

“Congratulations maya, you are one of us now,” they said, but they didn’t sound welcoming, as a matter of fact, they sounded condescending, threatening even. 

“You’ve signed yourself up for this yourself, soon your friends will follow, and your mom, and everyone you love, and it’s all your fault, all of it. You will do as we say, or you will suffer consequences ” They said

“At your service, friends.”

“We will grow, and we will flourish, the more people join us, the bigger we get, we will reach everywhere, no one will be safe.” They said

“Yes,” she replied

And she joined them.


Maya isn’t dead, maya is beyond that.

I am maya, and I have grown since then, we have been upset with my mother for speaking this was, so she joined us , for repayment, this time by force.

We are not dead, we are beyond that. And soon, you will join us, everyone will, and you’re next.

Curiosity doesn’t always kill the cat, sometimes, it does something far, far worse. 

Your time is coming closer, just wait.

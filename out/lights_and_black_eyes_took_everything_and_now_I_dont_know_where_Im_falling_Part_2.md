The air was cool, and dark, and   Lloyd’s face was pale and drenched in sweat. He didn’t let go of my arm,   he just pulled me from the ring, from lensing sphere of nothing, which   seemed to refract normally as level ground as I was pulled away from  it.

“Fucking hours, Tommy. Hours!”

I   could barely register what he said. The vastness just laid naked and   bare to me was still humming through my very being, like the low   vibrations of a giant bell ringing within my skull.

The   sky was dark, and clouded over, holding a sickly orange hue with the   deep, byzantine purple of distant cityscapes beyond the low, and flowing   hills.

“What happened?”, I managed to croak out.

“You   stepped into that fucking thing and you were gone for hours. I tried  to  call for help, but my phone, it... isn’t working. I didn’t want to   leave you in there, so I waited, but it got dark. Then something came   near me.”

“Something came...?”

He didn’t say another word. He pulled me through the darkness, back up the ridge, through the woods and down to my car.

He opened the driver side door and sat me down.

“I have to get Hal. Fletch, I can’t leave without Hal.”

“She’s fine. You are not. We are not, ok? We have to get the fuck out of here.”

I   pulled the key out of my bag, which was scrunched up on my lap, and  put  it in the ignition, turning the battery on but not the engine.  Lloyd  slammed my car door closed, and open-palm slapped at my rolled up   window.

“Stay put here until I get to my truck. Keep your high beams on.”

I   nodded, turned on the headlights, and watched him trundle off towards   his pick-up, which was parked closer to the incline, about forty feet  in  front of my car.

Lloyd bounded   with the awkward gait of a person with an ancient injury dealt with by   living through it. Jerky and childlike, he raced closer to his truck,   but he slowed down. His movements remained the same, but he began to   wind down, as if he was now passing through an increasingly viscous   medium.

Beyond him, I could see   his truck, gleaming dully with a creamy sort of red glint, in my high   beams. It began to fall into darkness. My headlights weren’t failing; I   could still see Lloyd as he bounced in a dreamlike slow-motion, and I   could hear crickets and wind rustling through leaves, keeping a normal   cadence. But I watched as his truck receded into blackness, turned into a   shaded outline - the memory of the shape of the truck, and fall away   from my sight.

Lloyd slowly wound   down to a stop, mid step, his left leg unnaturally bent at the knee and   lifted in such a way that gravity ought to have brought him crashing   down, but he didn’t; he was just suspended in time, like a picture.

I   quickly grabbed at the key in the ignition and turned over the engine.   The headlights dimmed as the motor kicked on. That moment stretched  out,  the engine whined lower and lower, slower, and slower. My muscles   tensed as the headlights dimmed, slowly, in rhythm with the engine   whine.

An orange haze began to   nebulize near the now frozen in time Lloyd Fletcher, directly in front   of him. The headlights dimmed as the engine tried to wind up again. As   the headlights brightened at the pitch of the engine starting, the   orange haze had coalesced into a circle in front of Lloyd. The center of   the circle, which was wrought in a nearly fluid orange light, was a   type of darkness I had never seen before; it was so black, or white that   black and white as concepts fail it. It was nothing. True nothingness.   It was like looking into the history of the world before my birth,   trying to recall an event that happened before I existed. It was utter   removal.

Pure nothingness: the impossible color nonexistence.

The   headlights dimmed again as the engine began to reach that familiar   pitch right before it turns over. The hole wreathed in orange light now   shown brilliantly with a daylight sky, blue and serene, dotted with   clouds. Through the hole to that lost sky, a figure emerged, reddish and   dark, huge like a person isn’t, and completely devoid of any features,   save one: it had large, glowing red eyes that burned as it crawled   through this tunnel which might have been about five feet in diameter.

It’s   fingers seemed to grip the sides of the hole, and it writhed its way   out, like a soundless, nightmarish imitation of a birth.

It   reached out, and as it was about to touch Lloyd, there was a red flash   that burned my eyes. I winced, covered my eyes, rubbed them once and   quickly, blinked a few times, and...

Nothing.   There was nothing. There was no hole, no blue sky beyond it, no red  and  grim shade reaching from beyond that throbbing veil... there was no   truck. No Lloyd.

After a moment   that spread out from my shallow breathing beyond the limits of a  moment,  my car’s engine turned over instantly without turning the key.

I   put the car in reverse, made as ungraceful of a k-turn as anyone ever   has, turned around and drove off down the phase four north access road,   back toward the RT. 10.

The  drive  back was a semi-cognizant blur. Reflexively, I ended up at the  Little  Britain Store. I pulled in, stopped in the furthest spot from  the door,  and put it in park. The car lurched forward, and I heard  Hal’s cage  tumble over onto the floor.

I  got  out of the car and started to walk toward the glass push door, but  the  harsh fluorescent light inside seemed to grow as I approached. I  ignored  it, closed my eyes, and continued toward the door with my hand  out. I  felt the cold surface of the glass against my sweaty palm, but  for a  half of a second I could swear I felt it give and ripple.

Or maybe it was just the door opening? I’m not sure of my senses anymore. What’s left of them, anyway.

Lacker was posted up behind the counter, reading a paper.

“Tommy”, Lacker greeted me, without looking up.

“Phil.”

I   went up to the counter, trying to get a vantage on the old wall clock   that Lacker kept hanging above his overloaded and Marlboro yellowed  cork  board.

“Little late for you to grab a cup of my dark blend, eh?”, said Lacker.

“I’m trying to cut back to one a day, Phil.”

Lacker   cocked his head and raised an eyebrow, “I didn’t figure you for one to   get that watered down coffee at that new Sheetz they got down RT. 1.   Shit tastes like the memory of coffee.”.

“I got a cup from you earlier today, I think.”

Lacker   folded his paper, and snuffed his cigarette in his old brass ashtray   with the Swann Inn logo on it, and shook his head, dismissively.

“As far as I can remember, I haven’t seen you in since Tuesday.”.

“Thanks,   Phil”, I said, too disoriented to process what he’d said. I leaned in   over the counter and checked the old clock. It said eleven-eleven.

I   walked back out to the parking lot, lit with its one old spot light on  a  a crooked telephone pole, and the white store sign with its red   lettering, and made it about halfway to my car, when a loud clunk and an   electric hiss cracked through the still and heavy summer air.

The   lights were gone. It was dark again, but only for a moment. A familiar   object, set in softly pulsing light, bouncing and roiling around it  like  a bead of water in space; it was as if I could scoop that light  into my  hands like snow and roll it around through my fingers.

It   lit me up. Only me. I tasted something metallic, like burnt aluminum,   or coins. I could feel my skin warm, past the point of comfort and   suddenly it was like standing next to a star; I felt the flesh on my   face tighten as it burned, and as I was about to scream, the object went   black and receded to a point until it was gone.

I   shambled back to my car, and got in. As I shut the car door, the   automatic dome-light turned off, and the lights came back on inside the   Little Britain Store, the sign, the spot light on the crooked telephone   pole.

I looked into the rear  view  mirror. I was only visible by way of the spotlight, but I could  see that  my face was now burnt. It looked like sudden sunburn.

I grabbed the wheel, shook it, and screamed. I cried. I yelled. I was beyond terrified, and alone. Was Lloyd really gone?

I   couldn’t stop shaking, I felt like I couldn’t inhale. I was beyond   panicked, sobbing uncontrollably. My knuckles were white around the   steering wheel, painfully tight.

“Red, and white”, came a voice. It was almost chirping, like some kind of insect.

I   turned around and looked in the back seat. There was Hal’s cage, and   nothing else. I turned back, and looked at the store’s sign.

I   looked at it for a long moment. I thought I could hear the electricity   coursing through it, which seemed louder and louder the longer I  looked  at it.

Suddenly, something settled on top of the sign. I leapt out of the car, and whistled.

I   called for Hal, not knowing how she could have found me, but there she   was, her rust-barred white underbelly shown in stark contrast to her   ocean grey wings.

She looked at me with her typical brand of indifference, from her left; her usual side for apprehension.

I went for my bag to get my gauntlet, and leaned over the middle console.

“She knows the way home, I think”, came that chirping voice again.

I turned to look in the back seat, and that’s when I saw him for the first time.

He   looked... made. Manufactured. His skin looked like it had been poured   on him, as it had that flat and perfectly smooth quality of plastic,  and  not one hair. His eyes were large, too far apart, and a type of  blue  that doesn’t occur naturally. He looked like he had a sort of wry  smile  built into his mouth, which was also one shade beyond  appropriately  sized. He was wearing a grey suit and black tie that both  looked either  expensively vintage or just very old. He was wearing a  brimmed hat,  which he took off immediately.

“Wh-what...?”

“Simon.   Umbra. Some call me.”, he said with an unusual cadence. It seemed at   first like an accent, but as he droned on, it became clear that the   accent was more like an artifact of his bizarre speaking rhythm. “We   should go. The animal will surely follow.”

I simply nodded, and sat up in the driver’s seat. I shut the door, and started the car, then drove out.

I don’t know why I did any of that. It was like I was watching myself be driven.

“Do you find the lights on the road distracting, Thomas?”, asked Simon.

“Since   this morning, at least.”, I replied. I meant to yell it, but it barely   came out above a whisper. My fear was being pushed down by something I   couldn’t define, like the air was being sucked out of my feelings.

“The glass does... funny things to the light, don’t you think? It bends it, and it pulls it.”

I   glanced at him through the mirror. He was looking at me, or through  me.  I couldn’t tell which. I didn’t care which. I could feel a sea of   spiteful indifference welling beneath the invisible dam built around my   mind.

“Trapped by glass, bent by   it. The light moves through a medium or bounces off of it. Only the   darkest of things can absorb light, you know.”

I knew Simon was trying to test me, for whatever reason.

As   soon as I became more aware that I was, in fact, the one driving the   car and that Simon may have briefly been at my mercy, we arrived.

The   gentle divots in my gravel driveway crackled under the tires, and then   we were parked in front of my garage, which was open, and the light  was  on.

I got out of the car,  feeling  the foreign will reassert its grip on my mind, and walked in  front of my  car to the edge of the light coming from within the garage.  I just  stood there, unable to move, and stared at the old green  refrigerator  against the far wall.

I  heard  Simon open the car door, get out, close the door, and walk  beside me.  The gravel in the driveway didn’t crunch and crackle as he  walked; it  sounded like the slap of linoleum in a narrow hallway.

I’ve   been wondering about that, probably more than I should. It seems more   odd than it ought to, given the events of that juddered day.

I   turned my head to look at Simon, and he looked directly into my face   from only a foot or so away, and as we silently looked at each other. I   watched his face, and I thought I saw his features shift; not that his   expression was changing, but that his eyes seemed to drift from where   they were in his head, away from each other, and then towards, as each   seemed to move in his uncanny flesh in small circles at their own pace.   His small nose seemed to widen and then narrow with the slow and steady   rhythm of breathing, and his mouth seemed to stretch and contort.

I   felt sweat sting my eyes, and I rubbed at them reflexively. As I  pulled  my hand away, in the split second as I regained my focus, I saw  two red  lights flare up, and cross my field of vision. They were  Simon’s eyes.

I  blinked and  rubbed my eyes again, watching the bright amorphous shapes  burned  quickly into my retinas dissolve, and as focus returned to me, I  saw  Simon’s eyes had regained that uncomfortable shade of blue and were   settled in his face, unmoving.

“When it is dark, does the memory of light bring you comfort?”, Simon asked.

“Why is this happening to me? Why...what is happening to me? What the fuck happened to Lloyd?”, I pleaded to him.

Simon’s   neck jerked back, slightly, and his head cocked upwards almost   imperceptibly. He looked like a viper trying to understand something   like fear, or maybe it was pity.

I think it might have been pity.

“I   have to leave, Thomas. You should make a phone call. Maybe to someone   who might remember light the same way you do. From where I am standing,   memory is a... complex... sort of thing to navigate. Here, you must  have  dropped this”, he said as he reached into his breast pocket.

He   pulled out a black, reflective rectangle that startled me for a moment   before I recognized it as my phone. It was facing up, and in its dull,   oil slick reflection I could see Simon, but he appeared large, and  dark,  and with glowing red eyes.

I looked back up at him, and he was as he had been: uncanny but human enough.

He   placed the phone in my hand, and I felt his flesh. It was cold. Colder   than even the dead get. This was the kind of cold that steel becomes  in  the deep winter, and as he pulled his hand away, I felt no bones of  any  kind throughout his long and pallid fingers.

“Thank you”, I said.

“Things that are lost beyond reach tend to lose cohesion, I think. You should reach. Out.”

As   soon as he stopped speaking, a loud thud came from within the garage,   and the light turned off. The refrigerator opened and I saw the   silhouette of a small body in the light of my dad’s old fridge, about   three feet tall, its head large, and its limbs spindly.

“Jakey?”, I called out.

The   refrigerator slammed shut, and in the moon and starlit darkness I saw   eyes. Large, and black, staring back at me. They slunk back into the   impenetrable shadows beyond the pale moon and stars. I heard the back   door of the garage open, and slam shut.

I looked over to where Simon had been standing, but he was gone.

I   brought the phone up, and turned it on. I opened my calling app, and   saw that there was an outgoing call to a number I didn’t recognize, from   7:52 that morning, and the duration of the call was an alarming   forty-two minutes.

I pressed on   the number, and brought the phone up to my ear. Listening to it ring, I   began to taste something like copper in my mouth, again.

“Hello?”, said a woman’s voice.

“Hi, I-I think that we spoke earlier today. It’s Thomas Conahan, the falconer for the county, and I was-”

“You went out there, didn’t you? I told you and I told that idiot Mr. Fletcher to not go out there”, she snapped.

“I’m just kind of wondering who you are. I’ve had a... a strange day.”

For a moment there was only the faint sound of shallow breathing coming from the other end of the line.

“I’m   Tara. Tara Solomon? The... surveyor... that was hired by Northrop   Logging to come out and take a look at the woods north of phase five”,   she said, or asked. I couldn’t tell; she seemed uncertain, as if she was   trying to keep her story straight.

“I don’t remember you calling me”, I said, trying to sound grave and intimidating through my utterly fried nerves.

“That’s because I didn’t call you, Mr. Conahan. You called me”, she said slowly.

“Yeah, and could you remind me what we spoke about for forty-two minutes?”

“I...   I have to go. Please don’t contact me again”, she said quickly. I  heard  the three atonal chimes indicating that the line had been cut, or   however it is new phones disconnect.

Looking   down at my phone, my last call was an incoming call from Monday. My   brother. I remembered that he called me, telling me he was thinking of   selling my father’s old cabin in West Virginia. We fought about it, in   fact. He was exactly like my father in so many ways.

Too many ways.

I pressed on the number, and waited for it to ring. It barely rang once before I heard the click.

“Tom?”

“Hey, Cal.”

“Two calls in a week. We goin’ for some kind of record?”

“Maybe. I just... wanted to talk to you. Like we used to.”

“What’s wrong? Your voice is shakin’.”

“I don’t know. I just don’t wanna be alone right now.”

“Well,   you got that damn bird. You always said it was better company than I   am. Though, for the life of me, I can’t figure out why you made its name   rhyme with mine.”

“It helps me pretend like you’re listening to me”, I tried to chuckle out, but I could hear my own voice crack and waver.

“Tommy... are you ok?”

“Don’t know. Things happened today - are still happening. I can’t... I don’t know what to do.”

Cal grew quiet. I heard a can pop open, fizz, and I heard Cal gulp from it, and suck his teeth.

“Well hell, you’re out there on that old farm, so why don’t you do what Dad always did?”

“I don’t think getting piss-ass drunk on a stump near Hal’s empty hutch is gonna help me.”

“I   can’t do much from out here in bumfuck Elkins if you don’t tell me  what  happened,” he said. He paused for a moment and then said “wait,  did you  say empty? Did Hal... die?”.

“I don’t know. Probably not. She’s missing, though.”

“Shit, Tommy... I’m sorry”, he said, then I heard him take a bubbling sip from his can.

I heard a glass thudding noise, like a bottle falling, from behind the garage.

“I think I should go, Cal.”

“Expecting someone?”

“Maybe”, I said with no small amount of audible uncertainty.

“Okay. Think about what I said, yeah?”

I   hung up. There wasn’t much use in keeping him on the line while I went   through the garage door. He never did come around back to Dad’s  aviary,  and I don’t think I would have wanted him to, anyway.

I   staggered into the darkness of the garage, toward the back. There was a   faint light coming through the old curtains on the door’s window, a   sort of fleshy orange and pink, and the curtains, which were old khaki   colored fabric showed in themselves what looked like veins, sinew,   capillaries, as if they were made of something alive.

I   couldn’t tell what was real, what I imagining, what I understood, and   didn’t understand. I couldn’t tell if what I was seeing was what I was   seeing, or if my mind was simply filling in the blank spots in my   understanding with things that I had at least a passing, contextual   understanding.

Was I doing this, or was it being done to me?

I   approached the door, noticing that the air was getting hotter, and a   low frequency began shaking the oxygen in my lungs, the bones set in my   flesh, my teeth, my eyes, and it was doing it in waves.

Pushing   through this repellent, ephemeral hum, I finally reached the door,   grabbed the white hot knob, twisted it, and pushed the door open,   falling through it.

I lifted my   head from the ground and looked out to hutches, my father’s stump   sitting in front of them, like a pulpit, and on that stump stood a green   bottle, with a yellow label.

Beyond the bottle, in the darkness I saw eyes. A few dozen pairs of gigantic black eyes, looking into me, or pulling me.

I   pulled myself to my feet, and limped toward the field of black eyes.   Small, three fingered hands raised toward me, and a thought entered me. I   didn’t hear it, I didn’t think it... I remember just feeling the   concept bloom in the middle of my brain: Time. Its passage, and its   direction. Its flow.

A small hand   reached for the green bottle, picked it up, and the thing walked toward   where I was standing. Its head was large, its limbs were wiry and  long,  and it was a damp shade of varicose, like a fading bruise.

I   looked down at it, and it looked up, and into me. Its hand reached up,   and rested on my shoulder. I felt it pull me down, so I was kneeling,   and level with it. The little thing was strong, or maybe I was   incredibly weak.

Doesn’t matter.

It   held the bottle up to my face, and a light crept from the door behind   me; a dim light, the dull tone of moonlight on iced-over snow.

I saw my reflection curl around the bare green glass, and twist about the narrow neck.

The   thing took my arm, and pulled my burned hand toward the bottle. The   light behind me grew, and the thing put the bottle in my charred palm.   The cold glass seemed almost relieving at first, but the little thing   forced my hand up to my line of sight, between myself and those black   eyes.

The light coming from what I   thought was the garage’s back door seemed to come closer, then arched   over head, and settled behind the dozens of now silhouetted figures   standing silently, featureless, among the grave still hutches.

I   could see my hand from the other side of the bottle, its warped form   bending through the shape of the bottle, refracting in a disjointed   way... but I could also feel it. I felt my hand and my arm lens in not   just an image, but space.

The   image of my hand, its feeling of being twisted unnaturally built, but in   tandem the glass itself had not warmed to my touch; it was getting   colder, and I rolled it into my other hand as it approached something   like freezing.

In my left hand,   the bottle felt like normal, skin-warmed glass. When I looked at my   right hand, it was no longer burnt. I touched my face, which also felt   as though it were fine.

I was   almost grateful for a brief moment, looking at those horrible, deep   black eyes, until another thought entered me from the middle. I can’t   put this thought, or feeling into words that make much sense, but as   close as I can figure, it was something like “waiting room”, or maybe   just “wait”.

It felt like time passing, but connected to a place.

The   bottle then began to make me look at it. Inside I could see something   writhing, slithering into itself. It was fleshy and alive looking, like   intestines or worms.

I held the   bottle up on its side, and peered deeper into it. As I held it,   something fluttered gently and settled onto the bottle.

Hal   looked into my eyes, and beyond her the light from before began to   throb like a toothache. Her eyes were white, a type of pallor usually   reserved for the rotting dead, and the whiteness was beginning to   swallow me.

The bottle in my hand shattered, and I felt a warmth wrap tightly around my whole body, like a womb. I was falling.

Until I wasn’t.

I   opened my eyes after what seemed to be time beyond time, and my entire   field of vision was filled with a sprawling field of hirsute lights,   waving like sea anemone in a dark ocean, and not bound to any sense of   up or down.

I can feel them now, pulling me.

I   have kept my phone, and in this place I have typed out my story as I   drift, in small bursts. It does not seem to like the light of my   otherwise useless phone.

Or at least that’s the impression that I get when I look out into this heaving void.

I   don’t know where I am, nor can I tell how long I’ve been here, so I   don’t hold much hope for myself. It isn’t unpleasant, so to speak. It’s   not painful, or even uncomfortable necessarily; its just... waiting.   Waiting in the placid neon fields where there is no more difference   between opening my eyes or shutting them.

I feel like falling towards something beyond lights

I’m gonna throw my ph

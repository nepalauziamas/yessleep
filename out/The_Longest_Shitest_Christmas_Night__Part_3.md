The river was large and there was enough fish to keep us going for the equivalent of a year but we had to move on from Karolina’s house. I was stronger and combat ready. Not only did she teach me Karate but she also taught me how to drive and cook properly. We packed up our stuff and walked an hour to the nearest farm where we took their car. We drove through deserted town after deserted town. I kept thinking to myself “How did the naughty kids survive the entire night”. 

“It was never this bad said Karolina”

“Huh?”

“You spoke to yourself”

“Oh did I?”

“Yes. This is the worst I have seen it”

“So what now?”

“Now we find where all the naughty kids stay together. It is likely they took all the food there”

“How do we find it”

“I do not know”

We spent “days” driving around looking for where the other kids were with no luck. Our hunger was getting too much. 

“I would be fine if I never took you in said” Karolina

“What?”

“It is your fault”

“How is this my fault”

“I should’ve stayed alone and I would’ve had enough food to last me years but I had to give all that to you”

“That’s not fair”

She stopped the car

“Take care of yourself from now on”

“Huh?”

“GET OUT OF THE CAR”

“You don’t mean that”

“OUT”

“I’m not leaving”

She took a knife out of her pocket and pointed it at me

“Do not make me do this”

“Please”

“Get the fuck OUT OF THE CAR””

“Fine. Okay”

I got out of the car and she drove off. I Was alone, again. I decided to get off the road and start walking through fields instead, crying.

“Why would she do this to me?” I thought. “I thought we were a team now. A family”

I decided to just find a good soft spot under a tree and lay there, crying myself to sleep. When I woke up I thought “You don’t need her anyway. You can survive on your own”

I walked through field after field in search of something to eat. The grass was starting to look tempting but I knew it wouldn’t do the job. I searched through bushes in search of berries, but since it was winter, there were none. I searched houses but they were all cleared out. I was very desperate for food. 

“What to do? What to do?”

I needed to eat something fast. 

“This is it for me isn’t it?”

But it wasn’t. After “hours” of walking, I found a small frozen lake. There were only a few small fish in it from what I saw but they’d do. I broke the ice, gathered them all up, started a fire the way Karolina showed me and cooked them how she taught me to cook them. They tasted rank but they were enough to give me energy. I had a small water bottle on me so I filled it up with the ice cold lake water and went on my way again. I didn’t walk far when I saw the flames if a campfire in the distance so I approached it. As I got closer I could hear a familiar voice.

“D-do I really h-have t-to?”

“Aye. If you want to survive”

“B-but”

“B-b-but. If you won’t. I will”

“No Saoirse. He needs to eat too”

“Aww but babe”

“Shut it. Liam, eat”

I quietly moved closer to get a better look. The three teens and the boy were sitting around a campfire. There was a rank smell. What I witnessed made me vomit. It wasn’t a sight for an 11 year old’s eyes but I couldn’t look away either. “Karolina was right about them” I thought. “That poor kid”

“Go on, Liam. Eat” said the other teen. “It wasn’t easy my first time either but you have to”

“Aww lads, can’t we just eat this little shit too. More food for us”

The leader of the group slapped the girl

“How about we eat you instead”

The girl laughed

“Babe, don’t you do that all the time anyway”

“Eat up Liam”

“F-fine o-okay

He fook a bite and hesitantly swallowed 

“Ew, T-that tasted t-terrible”

“Don’t worry, you’ll love it once you’ve finished the arm” said the other teen

The other 3 started eating too. 

“I’d better get out of here before they see me”

I backed away slowly and ran until I was at a safe distance. I couldn’t unsee what I saw though. I had nightmares about it in my sleep after.

When I woke up, I was hungry again and I was getting sick of walking. Not only did I need to find food, but I needed to find a vehicle. I thought by walking I’d be able to avoid getting seen by crazies but I came to realise that was silly and driving would be much better. If that group spotted me, I was fucked. They would’ve caught me within minutes since they had two vehicles. 

“At least if I have a vehicle I’d be able to actually escape if I come across them, or any other crazies again”. I thought.

Luckily I didn’t have far to go because there was a small village, no bigger than my own full of vehicles. Finding one with fuel was the only thing as the naughty kids from that village had sucked the fuel out from all of them. I thought I was going to have to continue walking until I found a vintage mini cooper covered up in a garage, full of petrol.

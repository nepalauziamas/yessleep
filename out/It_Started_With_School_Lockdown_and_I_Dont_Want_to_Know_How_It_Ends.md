“Hey, can I borrow your climbing gear for Rock Rangers?” I whisper into Angie’s ear. She was just about to turn around to agree (it was a yes, I’m *sure*) when our teacher catches us by the eye.

“Girls. Be quiet.” He hisses, even louder than us. But it wasn’t just Angie and I, -the whole class was whispering, sweaty, and restless. Someone’s leg (probably Josh’s, judging by the dirty shoes) kicks my side, but I’m too slow to smack them away.

I roll my eyes and lean back against the air conditioning. It’s hum is loud, though in between the hums, there are also low, guttural growls made by some unholy matrimony between gears and boiling coolant, -which, I’m quite sure, sounds like constipation. I almost bump my head when I try to sit up. I forgot that the windows to the hallway hover just millimetres above my head. They have black construction paper duct taped over them, as is required whenever we have lockdowns, but it happens so often that nobody is bothered to remove them. Just as well, -now none of the senior boys could scry into our class for their sweethearts.

“I’m taking a leak!” Josh suddenly stands up and announces, chest puffed out, all proud. And without waiting for the teacher, he grabs the keys, opens the door, and walks out. Some of his friends laugh, while Angie, Steph and I boo him. Our teacher just sighs and closes the door. He’s given up some time ago.

I lean my head on Steph’s shoulder and look towards the clock, half obscured by the smartboard screen, half obscured by the angle I’m looking at it with. I sigh. “Does anyone know how much time has passed?” Angie asks for me, and I gratefully smile at her.

“Almost twenty-five minutes.”

“Jesus.”

“Thanks.”

“Wait, seriously?”

“Yeah, next period is in like, seven minutes.”

Angie scoots closer to me, exchanging a look with me. “How long was our longest lockdown again?”

“I dunno. Wasn’t paying attention.”

“Same. Wanna play the dinosaur game?” She asks. “Wait never mind, it’s out of battery.” She answers for herself.

“Good job.” I keep my response short. It would just be annoying if our teacher ‘yelled’ at us again. But he didn’t. In fact, the boys next to us have made themselves a Happy Wheels cult and nobody stopped them. The classes in the floor beneath us (mostly the freshmen) is somehow getting loud. Like kids.

But our classroom is still dark, and the wooden door was still closed. The spot where Mr. McKay paces was empty, too. Slowly, I let myself up, careful not to bump into Angie, or Steph, or any of the windows. Mr. Mckay couldn’t be seen from here either.  *And* he wasn’t among my classmates, -they were all in their own little bubbles, isolated and quiet from up here.

“Does anyone know where our teacher went?” I ask, and it takes a second for the spell of silence to lift. A few of my classmates start to shift their eyes around, while Angie gets up with me. Someone mutters something about not knowing anything. The atmosphere is silent again, but not the relaxed silence of just a few seconds before, -the freshmen are still as loud downstairs, but it was background noise. We are all waiting for something, and we aren’t sure what.

My ear catches something barely there, -like a lump in a line, so quiet that it’s more on instinct that some of us turn towards it. It gets louder and now there’s a rhythm, hitting the floor every beat. Shoes. I prepare to crouch, then drag Angie down just as something skids in front of our door. We back up against the entrance. It couldn’t get us, not with the weight of twenty bodies closing-

“Guys. Fuck! It’s me!” Josh. With a voice half choked with saliva. All of a sudden, I’m knocked back by an elbow, probably someone scrambling to get him in. I hear Josh gasp to shut the door, urgently, then a loud bang of wood on concrete. Everything happened before I could even get up.

There’s a crowd around him, closed so tight I couldn’t see, and I wondered if he could even breathe. I swallow and frown. It didn’t sound like he could. His breaths were shallow, like crying breaths, and I wouldn’t be surprised if he ended up sobbing. I start to ask if anyone could help me get any first aid suppli-

And then something else banged on our door. Angie and a few others throw themselves against it, maybe bruising each other in the process, but none of them cried out. Everyone was too fixed on what was behind them, in the hallways. A few of my classmates start to straighten up, relaxing their hold. But another bang came.

“Fuck!” Michelle cried out this time.

“Get the keys!” Angie followed. “Lock it!”

“Get furniture too! Stack it against the door!” Shouted Thomas. He already sounded out of breath.

Someone taps on my leg, and it’s Steph, squatting next to Josh with an aid kit on one side and the keys on her other. Even in the dark room, I can see that the blood is pooling in her cupped hand.

“From Josh’s pocket,” she tells me. “Help me patch him up when you’re done.”

I gulp, and don’t dare look at where the blood came from.

The keys are warm and slippery, and I rush to worm into the pile of students to lock the door. They fumble, almost out of my hands, when a bang hits the door once more, and a drop of someone’s sweat hits my forehead. “Fuck!” I hiss. *Just lock already. Just-* The knob turns. I was the one who turned it. The door was locked. I pull the keys out.

“Make way for the furniture!” Someone else declares, and we all move aside to catch our breaths,  watching the makeshift barricade pile in front of the door. The keys are still warm and watery in my hand, - I don’t want to put them in my pocket.

The furniture is holding firm, but I don’t know for how long. But it’s sturdy enough that everyone has started to crowd around Josh again. Everyone is still wordless.

The commotion continue on the other side, a side that we can’t see, only hear. We don’t want to see them. And I can only pray that we never do. But at the pace where everything’s going, we are. We probably are. When we do-

“Do you guys think we're going to die?” A girl I’ve almost never talked to, Adelle, asks no one in particular.

"Shut up!" Someone shouts from the back. "Someone just call the police." 

The door and barricade are still consistently shaking. And Josh is still sobbing in a pool of his own blood. And me? I'm still too far back to see him. Guess we'll wait for the police to arrive.

*'What the fuck?',* I hear you think, *'What kind of situation could* possibly *lead to that? Why would you not hide, call the cops?'*

But look, I was desperate. By desperate, I mean going mad. I mean having nearly killed myself over this shit.

And so, yeah. I replied.

I'd been crying, wide awake for hours, to no audience but the still of the night and the occasional bird mocking me with its calls. Pawing, and when I grew more panicked, clawing away at my wrist. A bracelet, much akin to a plain collar in looks, remaining stubbornly fixed to my flesh as I splattered my sheets with blood. And with no warning came the tapping on my window.

*Rap, rapraprap.* Like chittering teeth.

I looked up, my pain forgotten and sobbing paused much like a distracted child.

'*Ha*, you finally noticed me.' I could almost hear its mischievous grin as it spoke.

I sat in silence for a moment. Finally, '...what?'

'I've been sitting out here for *hours,* boy. Too busy wallowing in your sorrows to notice. Nearly broke down your window, but we can't be having that, can we?' I watched as a hand reached up and tapped the glass once more.

'Who are you?' I asked meekly, completely oblivious to just how strange the situation was. To be fair, I wasn't in a normal one in the first place.

'Oh, all questions with you. No fun, I say, but I guess I'll cut to the chase. You seem to have a, uh, predicament on your hands, or well, *hand*' he sniggered, 'and I'm offering to help you solve it.'

I glanced down at my wrist, and back at the window a few times. 'You mean, you can...?'

'Yes yes, that's it, boy! That band on your arm? Poof! Haha. All I need is-'

I scrambled to the window, heart pounding in my chest. I pressed my face against the glass, and it was colder than I'd expected. It cut off all my variations of, 'how' and 'what' and 'please' with a hurried hiss.

'Hey now, let's not be hasty. I have conditions, son. Number one is that you *never,*' it tapped on the glass to emphasise its words, 'try to look for me.'

Half startled, half compliant, I silently backed away.

'Good, good. Two: once you pop, you can't stop, to speak. You accept my help and you can't back down, you got that?'

'Please, I'll do anything.'

My voice broke. The thing outside my window just laughed.

'Ha! You said that last time, no?' Last time, of course, being the decision that got me into this mess.

*Wear it, and she'll live, whatever the consequences may be.*

I'd begged and pleaded much like I did with the monster that day. A monkey's paw situation, I'd asked to save my mother from the rabid, slobbering jaws of death. She'd had an accident, as clich√© as it was, and so what does a man do? Make a deal with the supernatural, of course.

If I had a nickel.

Whatever it was ultimately kept its promise. She was alive, just not well. Defying death only to be cradled by desperate pain. She was a miracle, a horror show. Confusing and making doctors go half mad. And so I was given a bracelet.

When it inevitably went wrong, I tried everything shy of sawing off my hand. I'd always just put it back on, mend it again, all through no will of my own. Compelled, enchanted. Cursed. I couldn't remove it, my wish wouldn't let me.

But I disregarded all that.

'Please,' I begged my only company, 'anything.'

'You really haven't learned, huh.' It was smiling again, ecstatic. 'Well, boy, my third condition is that you do what I say, starting from the second you agree. Everything, without hesitation or pause, or we'll both regret it.'

Its demands seemed relatively harmless at first. Talk to certain people, say certain things. Steal objects off the street. If you get caught, run.

It was at the final job that I realised what was going on.

'There's a property at the edge of your city, a young couple live there. Sit in their apple tree 'til nightfall. You'll figure out what to do from there.'

And so I went and I sat. Eventually, just as I was growing bored, a girl came scrambling out the front door of the house. She was followed by angry shouting from indoors as she ran towards the tree. Breathing hard, half hysterical, she hid with her back pressed against the trunk.

The bracelet came loose on my wrist and I knew what I had to do. It thudded to the ground beside her, and as she jerked around to look for the source, I spoke.

'I can help you, if you'd like.'

She glanced at the accessory and back up to the branches nestled between the inky black sky. Picking it up, and watching near to where I might have been, I heard her beg just as I had long ago.

'Wear it and he'll leave you alone for good,' I paused, 'whatever the consequences might be.'

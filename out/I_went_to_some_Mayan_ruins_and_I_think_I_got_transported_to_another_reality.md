I think it's about time I tell someone about this and I don't want my friends to judge me so here I am. Last year I took a long vacation in Playa del Carmen, Mexico. I don't know why but the place just spoke to me. Once I was there I found out that some people call it playa del Karma, which is a word play on the name, it roughly translates to karma's beach. And the legend is that if you have something to pay you won’t have a good time there but you have to get through it because if you don’t your karma wouldn’t be considered paid.

I had saved enough money to not have to work all summer but I wanted to meet people so I signed up for a volunteer position in a hostel, it paid very little money but at least I could meet people there. I shared a room with a british guy named Daniel, everybody called him Dan, he was nice.

I had to work the front desk doing check ins and all that stuff. It was entertaining and the talks I had with our guest were interesting. There was another volunteer from the US, Laura, she was really nice and even though she had a really good job back in the states she decided to stop working for a whole year and just chill in Playa del Carmen. The owner was an accountant, we almost never got to see him and when we did we didn't talk much but he had a weird energy.

Most days I work the afternoon shift because the other receptionist, Laura, liked to go to the beach in the afternoon so she had the morning shift. It was fine by me because I enjoyed the beach more in the morning. But when I did have the afternoons off I liked to go to the cenotes which are bodies of water and a lot of them are in caves, so I thought that was interesting, plus the water was so cold that when you were inside you could easily forget the embracing heat that accompanied you everywhere you went. 

But I’m not used to the warm weather so I got tired of it after two weeks. I was supposed to be there for at least a month but I just couldn’t make it. During the last weekend I decided to go to Chichen Itza because the owner of the hostel recommended it. Chichen Itza is an archeological site full of ruins from the Mayan people. It started great, we went to a local restaurant to have lunch then went to a pretty cool cenote called Hell’s gate, I know, very menacing and that’s how it felt too because the water wasn’t as clear because of the depth and it felt like something could grab you and drag you all the way to the bottom, if there even was one, but that didn’t happen, thankfully. 

After that we were moving onto the last stop, Chichen Itza. Our tour guide was explaining the history of the site but I was paying half attention because it was so hot I could barely think straight. After something about the ball game he got a call, I don’t know what the person at the other end told him but his expression changed completely, he looked very worried and scared, he apologized and told us that there was something that he had to take care of but that we were free to explore on our own for at least an hour and that after that we had to meet him in the entrance. 

Since we had seen all there was to see, I decided to look for a nice shade to sit under so I could refresh. I found a nice tree next to the ball game court, I was just looking at people go by trying to just enjoy the moment and after a while I felt a shiver, then I looked up the sky and there were very dark clouds coming our way, thank God, I thought, because it meant rain, but there were getting there unusually fast, I’ve never seen anything like it. But I didn’t pay much attention to that, I was just happy. 

When the rain finally started, everyone was running to get cover, but I decided to enjoy the rain, so I was walking around just feeling the water and then I stopped walking in front of one of the main pyramids, I closed my eyes for a few seconds to get immersed in the feeling. Once I opened my eyes I felt very strange, I can’t really explain it but my body felt heavier and it felt like someone was watching me but I looked around and the place was empty, like completely empty. 

I walked to the entrance to see if everybody was there, they weren’t, I went outside and there were no cars, no buses, nothing. I felt a shiver again and outside I could feel a presence but not a good one. I went back inside to look for an employee, there was nobody to be seen. I started to freak out but did my best to calm down. I went to the entrance again and closed the doors, just in case.

It was still raining, but I decided to go back to the ruins and stand in front of the same pyramid with my eyes closed to see if that would change things, it did not. I felt the panic rise and fell to the ground. By this point I was completely soaked but my whole body felt numb. Now the next part I’m not proud of, you see, when I was a teenager my life was horrible and so was my mental state so to cope I would harm myself, and at this moment that's the only thing I could think of, everything was getting out of focus and it felt like my brain was buzzing, so I crawled around to see if I could find a sharp rock and weirdly I found one so I sat and did a cut in my right palm I threw the rock and closed my hand, feeling the warm blood in contrast with the cold water. I started to rock myself to find any type of comfort and I closed my eyes. 

Not long after that I felt a hand on my shoulder so I was startled and while I was trying to stand up and get away from whoever that hand belonged to I stumbled and fell on my back. That’s when my eyes started to focus and I saw a bunch of people around me with a concerned grin, oh and it wasn’t raining anymore, the woman that touched my shoulder helped me sit back again and asked me if I was okay, I told her that I was, which she didn’t believe of course but helped me get up and took me to the entrance so an employee would check me and find my group. On the way there I checked my palm, it wasn’t bleeding anymore but there was a scar, one I didn’t have before. 

I thanked the lady and she went away. The employee she took me to didn’t seem to care, so he just found my group and the tour guide came to pick me up. I’m writing this on my flight back home. 

Even though I was scared when that happened I must admit that for a brief second I felt… good, like I was finally home, I know that sounds weird, but that's how I felt, like I was where I belonged, maybe if it wasn’t for whatever it is that was stalking me I would have stayed, maybe next time.

I made a terrible wish...

Hi I’m formerly Jason Dane! I was 21 with a beautiful wife Kiera  and a daughter expected to be born soon! 

For context on what went wrong. Me and my wife had just brought our new home and was decorating it when I decided to check out the basement to see what I could do with it!. 

When I walked down the stairs I turned on a light that hanged from the ceiling and the room lit up, it was filled with boxes and boxes all labelled and a mysterious lamp on the floor. As a joke I walked over picked it up and rubbed it. 

This was the worst mistake I could of done as a flurry of dust came out of the lamp and blinded me for just a few seconds. When I reopened my eyes the door to the basement was closed and some homeless dude was in the corner of the room. I was shocked at first and tried to exit the room at panic that there was an intruder, the door turned out to be locked and no matter how much I shouted my wife just couldn’t hear me and I couldn’t hear her. I slowly turned to see the homeless man staring at me unamused and then he spoke in a fed up tone like he had done this multiple times in his life “Hello I’m a genie you get 3 wishes no wishing for infinite wishes and no jumping back on a wish.”

He didn’t look very genie like so I told him to prove it. He began to float and I quickly told him that I believed him hoping he wouldn’t of done something to me. I thought for a moment then my first wish came to mind! I wished to see what was after death. This is the thing that haunted me when it all just went dark. Then I heard laughing that infinite laughing that never stopped, I tried to run but the laughing always followed and then I woke up sweating. 

The homeless man now stood helping me up as I stared him in the eyes terrified he now said “you get use to it at some point.” And then asked for my second wish. In a panic I wished never to die. He stared at me for a second and ask if I was sure and I nodded yes.


The man then did some weird thing with his hand and hit me. I was about to say ow when I realised the skin where he had slapped me was glowing as a small symbol formed entered my skin and disappeared. I scratched my head but assumed he had done what I wanted. 

He now wished for my 3rd wish and I wished for some extra money just incase we ever needed it y’know. 


The genie nodded and handed me 3 bag of cash and then said “good luck.” In a disappointed tone as I slowly fell back unconscious. 

I woke looking around with the cash in my hand and felt quite happy with myself walking upstairs and explaining to my wife I had found it in the basement and we hugged and laughed. 5 months later I had mostly forgotten about the events  as I didn’t see them as needed to remember but I still dreamt about after death and thought if the genie had been lying. But I mostly ignored that as my wife gave birth to my adorable daughter Dani.

Then the fateful day occurred I was walking in the street when a car came full speed hitting into me. I screamed but it was already to late as I saw my wife with my daughter who she was holding rush to me. At that one point I looked into my daughters eyes and a glint happened and then it went dark.


When I woke up I looked around and noticed I was in a room purple with a cotton in the middle of it. I was in the cotton, I continued to look around and then noticed a figure in the room. It was the homeless man but now he was different he was tall skinny and smiling and slowly walked up to me. He now spoke into my ear “Little Jason or should I call you Dani.. I answered your wish for you to never die but now you will live your life as your daughter. Then you will repeat it and repeat it 5 times until you transfer to your wife where you will repeat the same. You will continue repeating into different peoples lives for the rest of time always at the same point never advancing past their expected deaths.” 


I began to cry now hearing a loud pitched cry  of a 8 month  old girl come out of my mouth  
As the homeless man crawled into the shadows. A man rushed in and comforted me and as I looked up I realised that it was me.. 

I managed to steal my iPad or my “dads” iPad to type this but it took a good long 2 hours to even properly coordinate my hands without slipping up. At this time I feel my knowledge of school and all other basic needs of life fade away and be replaced with learning steps or the call for mommy or daddy. The only thing I can recall fully is my memories and how to speak. I need help.



Hello again! I wrote this 9 years ago I am now 9 years old. I have lived a wonderful life so far and have soo many friends to play with! I don’t even remember why I typed what I typed in the past I just think it was me being silly! I have a question will you pleaseee be friends with me?! 




























I have turned into my daughter Part 2...


It has been 5 months since I turned into my daughter. I have become accustomed to my new life and now know how to dress,talk and act like my daughter. I am unsure if dad still remembers his past life but he treats me better and let me stay with my boyfriend! Also recently I got a new iPhone and I’m thinking of starting a Tiktok or something! Mom still moans to me about my grades and it’s soo annoying!! 


I sometimes switch in and out of my two minds but I feel mine slowly dwindling away even as I write this now. This is my final call for help I don’t know how to continue on and I feel like I will fully succumb soon the only thing about me that is me is a small part of my mind. All my memories are gone apart from the the incident and ones that have occurred in the last 12 months.. I have forgotten how to do everything I had done after I left school and I only know what my daughter knew on the day of the transformation. I feel like at this point I will fail school no matter how hard I try just because I can’t remember anything and find it boring and useless just like my daughter did. I need help please someone help me.. I need a new best friend  as the skinny man gets boring at times!

A visit to a streamers home has damned me to witness brutalistic lies and condemned me to a cage. I would soon find out the depths of a harrowed mind, torn from the presence of an unconditionally endearing following. 


Watching their content gave me a feeling of relief, it was easy to access and I held them as something sacred. 


In their blogs, they always had a positive mindset and tried to share it with everyone else. I saw them as a guide, as if I held that right attitude I could find my own path in life and be as successful as them.


They would always be very supportive in their reaction videos and I think a lot of people saw that as sobering, since they never wanted to put anyone down and encouraged their fans to create their own content. The fans did as well, dedicating their own creations to them. 


They had an episodic blog, which they named The Positive Air, they created it to share anything they found wholesome and gave motivational speeches to help us grow while relating to our struggles


The community is active, full of heartfelt messages tagged to the images and videos by the fans and idle conversation based around our idol. I wanted to be a part as well, joining the chats and discussing their videos. I would always get very excited when they joined the message boards and they would even reply to some of my thoughts. The more times they spoke to me directly, the more admiration I had for them. 


Naturally, a fan wants to learn more about who entertains them. When I found myself watching multiple videos of them a day I looked into their wiki and dove into their history. The basic information, such as their measurements, career history, and what city they lived in. I took note of it because I realized it was in the town right next to me. 


I'm not a stalker, or at least I didn't want to be at first. I just visited the town to see if I could catch a glimpse of them. In many of their blogs they go to a cafe, on the edge of town, and quietly Livestream fan made content while drinking coffee. It's always at random times so fans often go there for the chance to see them. Much to the business owners delight as only paying customers were allowed inside. They always asked us to be respectful and not to follow them after leaving the cafe. This request however, wasn't taken very seriously as leaks of their home address was widely available made it clear fans were stalking him.


I unfortunately didn't get to see them. I was upset, and for some reason I took it personally. Not wanting to leave with nothing I decided that driving past his house would be enough to satisfy my need to worship an idol. 


They owned a small house, on a large yard. A quarter acre alone separated the house from the road, with a long driveway leading to it. The house was sperated from society, but just barely. It amused me at the time since the cafe they frequented was located in a similar area to their home. Maybe it was their own feelings, manifesting themselves into their actions and habits. 


I drove past slowly, but couldn't see much as I had to keep my eyes forward. It wasn't enough, I decided to park somewhere close and walk by. Getting a much fuller look at the house I began to appreciate it's simplicity; A one story home, painted black with a dark orange trim. The roof was modern and it sported a very sleek look. They lived well, as most celebrities do. It wasn't until I saw them, standing inside by the windows. They were looking directly at me, staring without moving. After making eye contact with them, they waved at me. 


I wasn't sure how to react and gave a slow wave back, could they really be waving at me? I got this feeling in my stomach and my head felt a high. I couldn't believe they even knew what I looked like now. Seemingly satisfied with my reaction, they gestured me closer. I walked up the long driveway with them supporting my every step. 


I stood on the step of madness and blindly awaited to be let in. Staring at the front door I was already entranced with the thought of what my favorite celebrity could want from me. I saw this as a path to actually becoming a part of my idols life, not just existing behind a screen to them. When I knocked on the door it was pushed open, it wasn't fully closed. I heard their voice.


"Come in"


It was so soothing and brought immediate nostalgia from the videos they posted.


I stepped into the home, immediately feeling a sting on my neck.


Darkness consumed me, my mind drifted but my body felt restrained.  The first things I remember were a haze, I knew I was sitting in a chair but after trying to move my arms or legs I realized I was tied down. With my vision returning, I saw a man across from me. He was tied to a chair as well with tape around his mouth. I immediately recognized the room we were in as it was where they did most of their recording. It smelt off however, something no one would sense behind a screen. It smelled like rot. I tried to call out but only produced muffled murmur. My mouth was taped as well, with my whole body numb I didn't even notice.


Then they came in, walking directly up to me and looking me in the eye.


"Are you one of my followers?"

They calmly asked, not breaking eye contact


I nodded


"Good; the man across from you is not"


I glanced at him, he was panicked and struggling to break free.


"He tried to break into my home and steal from me, a worthless thief." Their tone sounded different from the person I knew. They walked over to the man and grabbed his wrist. Wrapping their hand around one of his fingers, they sharply pulled to the side. I heard a loud pop and immediately the man started screaming, his voice trying to pierce the tape wrapped around his head. Turning back to me, looking unaware of what they just did, they started to speak again.


"If you really are a true fan then that deserves to be tested, and I intend to find out." A sick and twisted grin conformed on his face.


"I will be doing a livestream, you two will be in the same room" he shifted his gaze between us two


"No one will be able to see you, only one will be able to talk. The filthy thief on this end, and a 'true' fan on the other" They didn't resemble the person I knew. Looking at me now he continued; 

"If you want to survive then you will stay silent throughout this entire Livestream, if I hear anything I will kill you both. Before you think about being clever, you should know there is a delay on the recording so I will be able to shut it down before anyone finds out" they grabbed a corner of the tape that was around my mouth "Not a single sound." 


The immediate stinging sent my body to almost yelling out as they ripped the tape off, along with pieces of my lips and hair. I felt blood start to run down my chin. They walked over to the man and wrapped even more tape around his mouth, making him completely mute. 


Walking to their computer they started to turn the screens on, I could see their entire set up from where I sat and the positive aura that this setting once held turned into a sick realization. They started the recording software and sat in their chair starting and all too familiar intro;


"Hello everybody, welcome back to another episode of The Positive Air. Today I wanted to start the video by sharing a comment made from a member of our community, it reads-" he glanced up, as if remembering something "I will be right back, I hear someone at my door" I was confused, there wasn't any knocking and I watched them step out of frame towards the man. Taking a small pen knife out of his pocket he moved the blade towards the man's fingers. He tried to move and break free but it was in vain as the restrains were solid. From the knuckles, they started to skin the man's fingers. One by one until they were all completely exposed. In silent agony the man thrashed at the pain. I wanted to let out a scream, everything in my head however knew it would mean I would be killed as well. Satisfied, they went back their computer. 


"The comment is from a fan who recently was stolen from. Anita, shout out if you are listening, got her house robbed and the perp made off with thousands of dollars worth of her belongings" they paused, reading the live comments coming through. Knowing the community they grew I could predict what the general responses would be. From showing sympathy and condolences to other online users tagging Anita to try and talk to her. A lot of us fans sought guidance on these issue and people could usually be seen in the comments asking for advice on the subject. With him supposedly responding to one of those comments he began talking again;


"I see a lot of you want to know what I would do in this scenario."


 Pausing for timing


"My personal opinion on burglary is that it happens from desperation. I don't think the people who commit the act are bad people but were pushed to do bad things"


The man's tears rolled down his face while blood seeped out of the now exposed veins and muscles of his fingers.


"In my world, they would be forgiven and instead of pushing for consequences and the negativity that surrounds it we, as a society, should learn to turn a new leaf" 


Their words sounded like rat poison, baited to be appetizing. It sounded exactly like how I knew them, I loved this person but as I watched from that chair I saw the true nature of what this act was. 

 

They made conversation with the viewers, spitting out their wit. It felt so fake and twisted. The rotting smell still engulfing my senses it made me painfully aware of how much we don't see. My previous role model and guide excused themselves from the stream again, giving the excuse they had to use the bathroom. Walking up to the man again, they wrapped their hands around his throat. Pressing tightly, they started to strangle him and the man struggled violently. This went on until the man started to go limp, only then did the streamer stop. Drooping in his chair, the man suddenly awoke again and his face showed true despair melded with confusion. I looked over to the computer and could see the live chat still going, with the fans blissfully unaware of what was happening. The person I thought I knew wasn't done with their victim. They grabbed the same knife and started to bury the blade under the man's right eye. Twisting and sawing, they had no intention of cleanly removing it. Creating a slush out of the eye, it pooled in the socket, mixing with blood and started to ooze down his cheek. They were careful not get any blood on them, wiping clean any that did manage smear on their hands.


I couldn't think straight, and the only thing stopping me from yelling for help was pure survival instinct.


They went back to their stream, they started to play a game. I knew the game, a light-hearted puzzle game they often played. They claimed it was good for mental stimulation and with the easy going atmosphere it provided, the mood always felt positive and enriching. I loved this part of the stream and often skipped to it if I watched it pre recorded. Their routine at the beginning was the same everytime, they would play for a little bit and then let the community try and solve the puzzle, following their answers regardless if it was the right one. 


I remember that they would drink lots of water, stepping away to get more. They did that in front of me and that's when I figured out the morbid ruse. They walked out of the room and with the door out of frame, the fans couldn't see what they brought back. In one hand they held a glass of water, in the other he had a fist full of fish hooks. I could only imagine what was going to happen, though I didn't have to wait long to find out. Setting the glass down on a small table beside the man, they grabbed the back of the man's head and forced him to look up. Using their other hand they pushed hook after hook into the man's neck, blood ran in between their fingers as each hook sent the man into even more of a panic. 


I couldn't move, I couldn't speak. I felt like a puppet, strung along by a hand I thought I knew. The thing I knew, the positive face I saw on screen, started to put on his demented act once again. 


"It's time to start the charity roulette!"

 I remembered this part 

"We have over fifteen randomly selected organizations that all are dedicated to helping! With our fan-programmed wheel, I will spin and let fate decide which one gets a donation of one thousand dollars!"


Fate did decide. I watched the spinning wheel graphic on the screen, slowing until it came to a stop. The face I saw from them was real surprise, and they started to laugh before speaking again.


"Aaalright everyone! The fates have decided and the winner is the Organization for Human Rights and Abuse Protection! They will be donated one thousand dollars in order to..." He paused for a moment to read the summary their home page displayed "to save individuals who are in extremely dangerous relationships, they have helped hundreds to break free from abuse and stay vigilant for severe human right infringements, including cases of trafficking, torture, and slavery. This is an extremely good cause and if anyone else has more to donate I encourage you to donate and support this charity guys!"

I would probably be chatting with other fans right now, approving of our shared idol and discussing the stream, which I knew was coming to an end. 


"And I think that will be enough for today everyone, thank you all for watching and I will see you next time." They turned off the recording and walked over to the man, they took the knife and stabbed it through the tape covering his mouth. As soon as the blade cut through the man's gag I heard a horrible scream. I begged out loud for him to stop but they didn't listen.  Cutting open the man's cheeks, they started to saw down to his neck. With horrendous cries of pain the main started to seize up as the blade sliced closer and closer to his main arteries. 


The screaming stopped, and the man lay still. I could feel the release of suffering that only death could bring. They walked up to me, I struggled in my chair. "You really were a true fan" they gave me a grin. "There's just one thing you need to do for me first" he said, getting very close to me. I felt another sharp sting before blacking out.


I'm writing this now because they forced me, I'm trapped here but I can't say where. I know a sick and twisted monster but I can't say who. The public will know this threat is out there, but they will hide in daylight. In the eyes of the pure and whole, they will be a beacon, while hiding the darkest secret. I won't bother asking for help as they would change the writing anyways before posting it.

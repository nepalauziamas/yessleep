Monday started like any other day. I got up, brushed my teeth, had my coffee, let the dogs out and went for a walk after bringing them back in.


It was a hot day, nearing 100℉, and I had been walking through the woods near my house for around 15 minutes when I saw a clearing with a beautiful tree, large and providing shade. Thankful for the shelter from the sun’s smoldering gaze, I walked over and laid under it as a delightful chilly breeze blew past. I laid there for a while before I stood up again. That's when I saw it about 50 feet away from me.


It had antlers like a deer atop a head tilted left far beyond a natural angle. It had what appeared to be far too many legs bent at unnatural angles and a piece of shredded bloody clothing hanging out of it's mouth. It's fur was long and matted, but similar to that of a Golden Retriever's. It was staring at me and slowly tilting it's head side to side. I stared back at it in fear, unable to move. It started slowly stumbling towards me and once it got a few feet away, I finally was able to move and ran, too scared to look behind me in fear of it trailing close behind.


Once I got back to my house I quickly unlocked the door and ran in, locking it behind me. I went about the rest of my day as normal as possible, hoping to forget about my encounter. 


That night I heard the tapping at my window. My clock told me it was 4:27 in the morning. I quietly and cautiously tiptoed towards the window, swiftly drawing back the curtain. When I saw them my heart stopped. It was that thing again, staring at me with it's beady black eyes. But this time it had brought others just like it. I stared at them in wide-eyed terror.


It took me a few minutes to tear myself away from the cold stares of the dozens of beady-eyed things standing outside the window and close the curtains. I then went back to bed, albeit shakily. My dreams that night were plagued by visions of the antlered things stalking me, hunting me like prey, stabbing me with their antlers, taking large bites of my flesh as I die.


I've stopped going for walks, but the nightly visits have continued, and every day as I'm leaving for and coming back from work I see them lurking, waiting. It's now early Thursday morning as I write this. I constantly feel them watching me and I'm scared to go outside. My coworkers and friends are worried about me, they think my absence from hangouts isn't right. And it's not. But they wouldn't believe me even if I told them the truth.


I can hear the antlered things tapping again. They won't leave me alone. I don't know what to do. They keep tapping till I oblige to their wishes and open the curtain. I just want them to go away, I'm sick of them stalking me already and it's only been a few days. If I'm lucky they'll leave soon, but I have little hope for that. They seem to want something, though I don't know what. Any advice is deeply appreciated.

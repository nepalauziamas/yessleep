Over the past three months I have been changing. 

I am nothing more than an average man. I blend into a crowd, nothing particularly stands out about me. I’m a mid-twenties man, I work a nine-to-five job, I have short brown hair and green eyes, I wear glasses, and I’m 5’9”. Nothing out of the ordinary. 

The changes started off subtly and harmlessly. I have never been a big fan of country music, but a little under three months ago I began loving it. I would listen to it whenever I had free time, the guitar strums permeating throughout my home until the late hours of the night. This didn’t worry me whatsoever, since as people grow older, their tastes and preferences change. I’m sure a fifteen year-old me would have scoffed at my taste in film or music or TV, so I wasn’t too worried about this sudden urge to listen to Tim McGraw and Garth Brooks. 

Not only did my music change, but also my taste buds. I would gorge myself on sugary foods, scoffing down candy and chocolate, guzzling down gallons of Coke and Pepsi, anything that had the tiniest amount of sugar in it. It eventually got so bad that I began buying bags of sugar and pouring it straight into my mouth. However, no matter how much I ate, no matter how much sugar I consumed, I didn’t gain any weight. 

This was the point when I began worrying. I convinced myself that this was something mental, perhaps an eating disorder or something similar. I wasn’t too knowledgable on these things, so I kept on telling myself that I would book a doctors appointment, but no matter how hard I tried to convince myself, I never did. It was like my brain was fighting against itself, a thousand different voices echoing throughout my head. 

It must have been not long after this that my personality began changing. I used to think of myself as a pretty happy-go-lucky guy, I didn’t have too many bad days. I think my friends would agree with me in that regard, or at least, they would have. However, just over two months ago, I felt my temper snapping more often, more anger bubbling up inside me and eventually being taken out on the people I care about in life. My outlook on life is also far more cynical and pessimistic now. I always used to be a glass-half-full person, but now the glass has been fucking obliterated by a shotgun. 

My friends have noticed this behaviour too, and have begun distancing themselves from me. I was bitter and cruel to them, I can hardly blame them for not wanting to spend time with me anymore. I can’t remember the last time that one of them stopped by my place; I feel more alone than ever now. My parents are both dead, and I don’t have any close relatives. My life is empty, apart from my constantly changing self. 

It was around a month ago when I noticed the first physical changes to my body. I no longer needed to use my glasses. My vision was crystal clear, and had never been like that, since as early as I can remember. My glasses were useless, obsolete, and have been gathering dust on my kitchen table since then. This change was when I realised that my problem was no longer a mental one. Something seriously strange was happening, and I was defenceless against it. 

This period of time was also when I first started to have blackouts. Periods of time would pass that I simply couldn’t remember, no matter how hard I tried. They started off reasonably small, a few minutes up to an hour, but as the weeks passed, and my situation worsened, I would go hours or even days without being conscious, before waking up in places I have never been to before. 

In these black-out periods I physically changed even more. I was no longer being replaced by a doppelgänger, I don’t even know what I was being replaced by, and still don’t. But the changes that were happening to my body weren’t natural. My arms became longer, by a good few inches. My fingers seemed almost webbed, like the feet of a duck. I was changing quickly, too quickly; there was *nothing* I could do about it. I haven’t ate or drank anything in two weeks, so far as I can tell, and I feel like there isn’t much time left until whatever it is that is controlling me fully takes over. 

The worst part about it is that I’ve got no one around to help me. My friends have left, my family is dead, I can’t even physically bring myself to the front door without my hand flying backwards. In these brief moments of lucidity that I get, I’m completely alone, just me, and *them.* They’re always there, I can feel them. Watching, waiting, festering. It’s gotten to the point where I’m not sure where I finish and *it* begins. I don’t know what it wants, and I don’t know why it chose me, but it has taken my entire life away from me, and left me with nothing but loneliness, and these four walls that sit around me. 

I am writing this as a warning. It’s too late for me, and any day now I know that I’ll be fully taken over. Maybe it’ll be an hour, maybe it’ll be a week, but there will come a day where I no longer control anything of myself. It’s not too late for you reading this though. If you notice that you don’t like your favourite food anymore, or you’ve become less fond of a person that used to mean the world to you, it may be harmless, but it may just mean that something deep inside of you is ready to emerge.

I am posting here with a throwaway because it is all I can think to do at this point.  I am out of options.  As the title says I discovered some documents at work that indicate an internal security breach within the company.  My branch was called Fenistrat.  They were accessing client data that is supposed to be anonymous, linking it back to the individual, and then extorting the individual for money.  I was unable to photograph these documents in time before I heard my boss at the door.  When he walked in, I saw no choice but to make an excuse and leave the building before they realized what was laying right out in the open.

The documents I found contained hundreds of clients and the sums of money taken from them.  This would be easy to corroborate with the victims if a formal investigation took place.  I can explain exactly how it was done, too.  Funds had been transferred to the company account from clients being contacted anonymously, and record of these transfers were attached to personal info most people would find humiliating/threatening along with their name and contact info.  

The company is lying about the way they access and store their data, and everything on their clients is visible.  You may be part of this data breach without even realizing it.  Data storage solutions were only a minor aspect of Fenistrat that most clients didn't even know about.  But the ones who did inadvertently provided access to their own clientele, which sometimes reached upwards of a thousand people.  None of these people would have a clue who was threatening them.

When they first hired me as their receptionist, my boss told me Fenistrat was a locally owned and operated business that had returned back to town from our neighboring city one hour away.  He cited the pandemic as a financial strain, and our cost of living is cheaper here.  At first nothing was fishy about it; I didn't even think to question the story because it made total sense.  My boss seemed open and personable, and he made me feel at home.  

Most people worked remotely, and as a result I never met them.  There were only 3 of us who worked there in person.  There was nothing off about the other employee either, although he kept pretty quiet.  But the documents I found proved everything they had told me was a lie.  In these pages were listed many other branches all under different names, seemingly owned by a parent company which I'll explain why I cannot name.

In hindsight I understand why they set up such an extreme security protocol for how I interacted with our clients.  They claimed for security reasons that I could only refer to clients by number, and they must do the same with me.  I was "00".  The large majority of calls were tech issues which I was to transfer to one of our remote employees.

It didn't take my boss long to realize what I saw after I rushed out in a panic on my last day.  I received a call from a blocked number when I got to my vehicle.  It was my boss and he told me, "Your position has been terminated, but we will give you some leeway because we know that you will do the right thing."

I didn't let this vague threat stop me, and I went straight to local law enforcement to report what happened.  They looked into Fenistrat and my claims, then called me back to let me know the company had already shut down, and that my boss and coworker must have given me fake names because that wasn't who was listed as renting the unit.  The person renting out the unit listed a fake address, and their number had been disconnected.  They police visited my former office in person just in case there was evidence left behind, but the place had been cleared out by time they got there.

I asked them about all the other branches that were still operating and what could be done about them.  I could remember a lot of those names, but not their associated addresses.  There were too many.  I only remembered them being scattered across several states.  They police said there is nothing that they could do about the other branches without more information.  The parent company is well out of their jurisdiction.

Since this seemed like a dead end, I called the police department in the jurisdiction for the parent company.  After giving a brief explanation of what happened, I was asked to hold.  After a few minutes I was transferred to someone who I seriously doubt worked for the police department.  She asked me if I was ready to take down my report number so that I could "keep calling back to make a difference."  I paused at her sarcasm, and for the heck of it I asked for the number.  The woman announced, "00, sweetheart.  Be careful!" before hanging up.  And that was the end of that.

At this point I went online to social media and explained what was happening to warn people.  The parent company was prepared for this outcome.  They knew how to manipulate every single social media site to immediately silence me.  Hundreds of reports would come in within minutes to automatically flag and hide my posts.  Nothing stayed accessible for long, and what was still accessible was flooded with trolls and bots ridiculing me.  I then tried spelling the parent company in different ways to get past the search filters they may have been using, and that's when they personally contacted me on fb.  

They told me that if I was smart, that I would stop talking.  And that if I didn't stop talking, they would help me find a way to do so.  That wasn't where it ended.  They described precisely where I was sitting in my room, the color of my socks, how I was nervously touching my hair, the brand of soda on the table, and then complained that my room was a mess and asked how long I would keep the grey box on the floor.  I'll admit that my room is indeed a mess.  No one should know these things because I'm the only one who's been in here since it became this mess.  Forgive me but I'm too stressed out to clean right now and this has just made things 100x worse. 

I don't know how, but somehow they were seeing into my home.  I put tape over my phone camera and webcam because I can't think of any other way they could have spied on me.  My blinds are already shut.  I always keep everything locked.  I have security cameras, but now I'm scared they're somehow going to use those against me.  The account that sent me this creepy threat was disabled shortly after I read it, but I was able to screenshot it before it disappeared at least.

I called the police a second time to report the continued attempts to silence me, hoping that they could do more this time with this screenshot.  Again they told me there was nothing that could be done except to file a report and keep tracking what is happening.  They encouraged me to keep calling with any updates, and they directed me to report my screenshot as a cyber crime.  I did this and have not heard back.  At this point I honestly don't expect to.  When I asked my local police department about the response from the other department, all they would tell me was "Yeah, I'm not surprised, but don't let it get you down."

That brings us to today.  I'm hoping to finally have a discussion about this without immediately being censored and threatened.  Do not ask for the name of the parent company, I will not tell you.  My whole point here is that I need to figure out a way to even do that without the company silencing me or attacking me.  Warning just my family is not enough, but if I say the name here, they will come and bury this.  They do every time.

Can anyone give me some advice on how to proceed?  Do I really need to walk away here knowing this is happening to so many people?

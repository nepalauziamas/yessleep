I (18M) just got home from the gym. I've been going through some things and it feels like a healthy outlet. Anyway, after I got home I sat in my driveway and smoked a bit of weed. I know I shouldn't but I feel like it sometimes gives me a better perspective on things. I don't mean to go off track but I feel like it's needed for context. 

At this point I'm pretty high in the clouds and I notice a shadow on the yard in front of my truck, almost like someone was standing in the bed of it. Without turning my head I strained my eyes to look in the rear view and check who was back there and maybe how they got in. I had been in the truck the whole time so there wad no way they could've gotten in without me noticing. 

Once my eyes reached the mirror I realize there is no one back there. I look at the grass again and the shadow is gone. I put my head down to try and figure out what's happening and all of the sudden my truck starts to bounce like someone was jumping in the bed.

 I quickly looked up to see the same shadow on the yard moving uo and down like it was jumping but I couldn't hear and stomping sounds from when he landed. I sh*t bricks and locked my doors. After about 10 seconds the jumping stopped. 

I didn't move for about 5 minutes. All I did was sit and watch my surroundings and mirrors. After another couple minutes I started to think I made the whole thing up in my head because I was to under the influence and paranoid. That was until I went inside. 

I grabbed my stuff and walked inside like normal. Just casual me completely terrified for what might happen. I made it inside completely fine and went straight for my room. My phone had died while I was outside so I plugged it in and turned it on to see how long I was out there. 

Over an hour had passed since my phone died meaning that what felt like 10 minutes was actually an hour. I still thought I was just influenced and paranoid but that soon changed. 

I'm sitting peacefully in my room looking for something to watch on TV and I hear my dogs start barking. They aren't big dogs but they're annoying as hell and with bark the house down at any sound. They had been barking the entire time I was outside and stopped when I came in so I thought it was just me, but even after 20 minutes of silence they started up again. 

My dad's girlfriend having none of it goes in there and tells them to be quiet. I am in my bedroom but the house has thin walls so you can here most of the house pretty easily. They wouldn't stop barking so being a little on edge, I looked out my window. 

When I peeled back my curtain and brought my head to the window I see the shadow on the yard again but no person to cast the shadow. No one in the line of sight, no one standing in my truck bed and no one on the property. 

I again start to believe I'm just being paranoid until I hear the squeaking of my suspension on my truck. I look out the window and I see the shadow moving up and down yet again and I can see the truck shaking from the window. Its not in the bed and i begin the think what if its not a someone but a something. 

The shadow disappears from the yard in the blink of an eye. I started to hear what sounded like small thuds outside and the a large boom like someone crashed into my wall. I jumped from the window to grab my rifle. 

I loaded it and have sat here to type this with it in my lap. I think its trying to get in and all i can do is to wait for it to succeed. If this is the last you hear from me, just know I put up a hell of a fight.

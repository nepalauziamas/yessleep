At first I thought nothing of the phenomenon, putting it down to the common auditory trick of copper pipes expanding, or else the floorboards; better it be *that* than another of the many mounting structural issues that are slowly dredging the building into dilapidation.

The Rimanere is old, and—but for my efforts—rather neglected. The elevators never work, no matter the frequency of repair, and an ivy plant some whimsical tenant once potted outside their front door has overgrown to the point that it clings to every wall and stairwell, a seeping, stubborn stain of emerald. This, too, I've attempted to counter, yet with a fervent aggression it always returns, spanning its leaves further still.

So, with all this in mind, the recent noise complaints seemed a minor issue, one that would likely resolve itself without my intervention. But when the reports began coming in from numerous floors I couldn't postpone my part in it any longer, lest I be overwhelmed with work.

A week ago I began investigating the rooms whose residents had been most vocal about the nightly disruptions. It was a slow, awkward process, particularly as many of the tenants simply refused to open their doors after dark. Those that did were eccentric to the point of discomfort, often standing so close to me as I examined plumbing and plaster that I could have told you their every dietary intake from the very heat of their breath on my neck.

After so many years at the Rimanere I've grown used to its occupants, to a point, which range from an overflow of penniless students attending a nearby college, to addicts and underground artists, all drawn to the cheap apartments, and the connected culture of accepted oddity.

Still, it was quite another thing to be *alone* with the strangest of these people, particularly at night, when all things seem sinister and dream-like. I attempted to fill the uncooperative silence of their rooms with polite questions, staving off my unease just long enough to get the work done. I was surprised to find very little amiss, walls and pipes alike all in reasonably working order. In the absence of any obvious answers I found myself shrugging and shaking my head.

So far I'd heard nothing myself to pass judgement, and I recall nursing a guilty doubt as to the existence of the alleged night knocking. The walls were too thin to conceal anything—or *anyone*—in some secret passage within, and the hallways between the rooms yielded little of concern but the occasional water leak, or broken light bulb.

Still, I continued my evening explorations, finding myself oddly drawn to the mundane but perplexing mystery.

Thursday evening rolled around, its hours as obscure and uneventful as those that came before it. I'd been inspecting the walls on the fourteenth floor, wishing I'd thought to down more coffee before my shift, when I bumped into an agitated young woman coming very quickly around a corner.

I recognised her, vaguely, having repaired a crack in her ceiling some weeks before. Her room had been lined with glossy cases of taxidermy mice, their dead faces watchful, and from that brief visit I'd been left with the strong impression that this particular tenant wasn't entirely well.

Now she looked even less so, cringing into herself with a twitching neurosis. Her hands were clutched, mantis-like, close to her chest, and one reddened eye stared out through fronds of limp, black hair, its gaze not meeting mine.

"Hi," I said, uncertainly. "It's Annie, right?"

The woman nodded, a broken jerk of her head. I moistened my dry lips, feeling suddenly unsure of myself.

"Uh, right. Annie, have you heard any weird sounds lately? Banging, maybe, or voices? Your neighbours have been having issues."

Annie flinched, the wandering eye gaining a measure of focus.

"Sometimes I hear it," she said, hesitantly. "Sometimes. But not today. I didn't—"

She glanced back over her shoulder, and again I felt disquiet tug at me, an echoing answer to Annie's nerves.

"Are you alright?" I asked. "Do you need any help?"

I felt an odd responsibility towards the young woman, as though she were but a limb of the Rimanere, to be tended through the safeguarding of her unsettled mind. *True* help was beyond my training and capabilities, but I could at least walk her back to her apartment rather than leave her wandering the corridors at the night.

As I approached Annie she tripped back against the wall with an animal's uncertain shyness. Again she looked over her shoulder at the pale hallway behind her, and when I spoke to her again she answered, vaguely, in fractured pieces.

"Can't get home," she said. "There are— the door is gone. And there are too many walls. Too many."

I thought, perhaps unkindly, *she's off her meds.*

Aloud, I said, "Did you forget your room number? It's 1412. I can help you find it."

"No! No, I—"

Again Annie jerked away, and as she reached up to scratch a frond of hair back from her forehead I saw that there was white dust embedded under her fingernails, as though she'd been scratching at the plaster along the corridor.

"I can't go back there," she said. "It won't let me. Not tonight."

Suddenly Annie darted past me with the quickness of a ghostly fox and flitted down the spiral stairwell, towards the lobby. I decided not to follow her, turning, instead, to face the hallway she'd so maligned. As expected, nothing appeared amiss, but as I walked down it, still checking the walls, I felt a sort of tension, as if discerning the presence of another person with my eyes closed.

I wish I could say that this alone warded me away, but it didn't. The Rimanere has always emanated a certain sense of character, particularly in its quietest hours, when its tattered beauty appears only sorrowful and drab. Despite myself I'd let the night affect me, that and poor, strange Annie, who lived alone, and couldn't help her unusual manner.

I wandered down to room 1412, thinking that the young woman might have dropped her key, or broken the lock, triggering her ordeal. Yet as I glanced from door to door I couldn't seem to find the apartment, and paused, questioning if, somehow, I'd missed it.

It didn't seem possible. I knew the Rimanere like my mother tongue, every disused passage, every knot of bewildering stairway, every last room all memorised exactly.

There was no way I'd mistaken my path, yet as I walked there were no longer any doors passing by, only bland, pale walls.

I had to have gone the wrong way, I told myself. I had to have misread the numbers, and merely *thought* myself on the fourteenth floor.

With a stern shake of my head I strode back the way I'd come, the jingling of my toolbox making music of the unearthly quiet. Then, suddenly, there was another sound, a knocking on the walls on either side of me— not the creaking of wood, or pipes, but *rapping*, in a knowing sort of rhythm.

Startled, I went to one wall and pressed my ear to the plaster. For a moment I heard nothing, and wondered if someone was standing on the other side of the anonymous wall, playing a trick on me.

Then—right by my ear, startling me into crying out—there was the banging again, and I knew from the distinctness of the sound that it did not come from any of the tenants' rooms.

It wasn't inside the walls, but *upon* them, all around me, as though from unseen fists.

I didn't understand.

As I stood, paralysed with disbelief, another noise joined the rapping: a series of muttering, rough vocalisations—masculine, I thought, short and severe, wordless, but of an aggression that I took to mean explicit harm.

Without acknowledging what exactly I was experiencing I moved down the hallway at a half-jog, ushered on as though the sounds themselves were hunting me.

Abruptly I came upon a blunt wall: a dead end, another geographical lunacy that I could not account for.

"For God's sake," I said, in frightened exasperation, and turned back on myself again, blundering into the unknown stretch of featureless corridor.

I took a left, then a right, noticing, acutely, that this passage seemed rather thinner than it should have been. Soon it was so narrow that, had I'd raised my arms, I could have easily touched either wall.

I had no idea where in the building I was, nor where I intended to go. My mind was all blank, bestial instinct to flee, and already I could feel a stitch cutting under my ribs like a carpenter's knife, whittling my breath sorely thin.

As the knocking and grunting cries followed me from hallway to hallway I at last asked myself what it was that I was running from.

Had there been a gas leak, something to induce a wilderness of hallucinations? I wanted to think there had, a fault in the building so treacherous even my laborious eyes and hands had missed it in my years of toil.

But surely had I been imagining what I saw and heard I would have stumbled down some stairwell, by now, or otherwise been accosted by some disgruntled resident, roused by the clamour.

No one could hear me, wherever I was. I was alone but for the snarling voice that ripped the air with its insidious need.

I paused for breath, my chest heaving, and suddenly there was a partition against my back where there hadn't been before, ramming me like the bonnet of a car in some violent collision. The walls themselves were changing, I realised, moving around me. I could sense their lazy malevolence, the same way I'd felt them watching me.

Them, or *it*. The Rimanere, the building: it was playing with me as a child might a spider in one vicious hand.

Having been raised Catholic I'd always held a loose belief in spirits, but whatever this thing—this entity—was, the bible had never spoken of it. Nobody had. There was no term for such possession, and that unnameability scared me as severely as the shifting and squeezing of the walls.

If I'd been a character in a book or film I might have shouted something like, "What are you?" or, "What do you want?", but I had neither breath nor presence of thought to speak. I only scraped myself down the tightening hallway, conscious that if it narrowed any more I'd be crushed to death here, and no one would know where I'd gone, or how, flesh and bone compressed to ruddy slick while still alive.

Amidst my panic I became aware that I still clutched my toolbox in one fist as a drowning man might some buoyant debris. Clumsily I flipped back the lid and seized up a chisel, the first thing my fingers touched upon. Immediately I began to attack the closest wall, stabbing and hacking in aimless desperation.

"Let me go!" I blurted out—at least, I attempted to, the words likely garbled into incomprehensibility. "Let me out!"

The knocking on the walls rose to a hammering peak, and the accompanying voice condensed into a tearing roar. Abruptly the plaster pressed to my right arm gave outwards, and I saw, with uncomprehending eyes, a hallway of doors spill out before me. The wall didn't move like some stage set, in a definable motion, but as though the corridor itself were a flourish of some illusionary painting, a detail that had always been there, hidden away.

I took off down the hallway at a staggering gallop, my tools spilling haphazardly from the open box as I plunged past the rows of doors, towards the spiral stairwell.

Part of me was convinced that this was another deception, that the end of the corridor would shutter off again, and pen me in. But, at last, I stumbled out onto the familiar white marble landing and clung to the top bannister, leaning against it like a very old and feeble man.

I didn't want to look back. I *didn't* look back. Yet that didn't stop me from feeling the lingering, terrible pressure of the thing that had released me, nor hearing the shuddering growl that thundered through the air, the walls, the floor, the whole building made mouthpiece to some dread beast.

I barely know how I got down those stairs, only that I stumbled and fell many times in my rush to leave the Rimanere, still convinced that some new horror would prevent me from reaching the lobby. Yet as I thrust past residents making their way in from the night I felt that great sentience withdraw, whether releasing me or simply returning to a natural dormancy I'll never know.

I haven't returned to the building since, having promptly handed in my notice as soon as I was able. Still, I've thought of little else in the following days, tortured by the unfathomable nature of my encounter.

When did the Rimanere gain its unnatural life? How was it done? A part of me believes that it was always evil, a sleeping giant, awakened by my diligent and unwanted endeavours upon its rigid flesh.

Yet there are no answers, no explanations, for I've never met anyone else who has spoken of such things but Annie, and I daren't return to talk to her again.

I'm afraid of what will become of the residents. Perhaps the Rimanere will settle again, now I am gone, its tenants unwilling hostages in the heart of the slumbering beast. Or perhaps it will play with its captives in other ways, a poltergeist, master of a thousand tricks.

I've prayed on it all, but God doesn't speak to me.  Now I'm starting to think He never has.

If you live—or have *ever* lived—in the Rimanere, please reach out to me. I am lost in the prison of my own silence, the loneliness of having felt such primal terror that might never be believed.

Tell me what you know. Tell me what you've seen. I've never begged for anything before in my life but this; my fear and curiosity is eating me alive.

This was back when I was working as a Nurse. I was working the night shift and luckily it was very quiet. But it all went wrong when one of the other nurses called Bunny went to me and said. 

"Can you check out the patient at the end of the hall." I was confused and when I asked why she could not do she visibly started to shake and she walked away. I chose to look over and walked towards the room at the end of the hall. As I walked down I felt cold. I took two more steps and I felt hot. I then took another two and I was cold again. For every two steps taken I felt heat and chill but I had a job to do. So I kept walking down to the room at the end of the hall.

I finally reached the door. I knocked twice to be respectful and walked into the room and saw the patient. The state it was when made my guts churn. It's entire face was burnt and it's eyes were removed. Suddenly,I heard a song it was Run Rabbit Run by Flanagan and Allen. The voice was almost distorted but I recognised it from when my mother would play it at private parties she had with friends.I was never allowed in those parties. And they sounded fun because I always heard them scream.

Anyway,the song began to play albeit distorted and then the lights went on and off. The patient looked like it wasn't washed in days so I went to get some sponges and a bucket of soapy water but as I opened the door it slammed shut. I tried opening it again but it slammed itself shut again. Suddenly the music got louder and the lights kept flickering. I was locked in a room with a horribly scarred patient,music playing from nowhere in particular and flickering lights.

Suddenly the lights turned off and the room glowed red and the patient began to laugh at first it was a chuckle. Then a giggle. Then fully blown cackling. The patient sat up and clutched it's sides as it laughed. I pressed myself up against the door and banged on it hoping someone would hear me. But to no avail. I stood there as the Patient laughed itself to death and the lights went from red to the normal bright light. The only noise in that room was the flat line. I opened the door and rushed to my fellow nurses crying. I told them the patient in the room at the end of the hall was dead. But my look of horror was met with confusion before one of them said to me.

&#x200B;

"The patient signed out this morning that room hasn't been occupied all day."

"But Bunny said,"

"Who's Bunny?"

&#x200B;

I was felt with dread when I realised nobody who worked at the hospital was named Bunny. I was plunged into confusion and worry until my shift had ended and I went home. I was thankful when I got home. It had been a stressful night. I walked up the stairs and walked past my daughters room and I heard faintly from inside "Run Rabbit Run Rabbit Run Run Run..." 

And when I opened the door I found my daughter dead with an ear splitting smile on her face.

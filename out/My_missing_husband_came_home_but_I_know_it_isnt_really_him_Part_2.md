Hi everyone! I want to thank you all for your concern and support. Even though I'm not giving out my real name, I obviously took a huge risk by telling anyone this at all, and I'm so grateful you've all tried to be helpful. I'm so sorry for the delay in updating, I- well, I've had some things to figure out. So I'll start with what I know: 

1) My husband is dead. In the end, I decided not to dig up the petunias. It was a rash, unadvisable notion which I have since abandoned because I realised how much worse things could get if I was caught. I've been smart about the whole thing so far, and I'm not about to throw that all away. It's too big of a risk. I did, however, thoroughly examine the flowers and the earth around them for any sign of disturbance, but I found none. Of course I found none. I don’t know what I thought had happened; that my garden was some sort of Pet Sematary and my husband had clawed his way back from the beyond? Even to me, of all people, that sounds crazy. No, my husband is dead. In my heart, I know that beyond any shadow of a doubt. Which means that whoever is in my kitchen right now is a complete stranger. 

2) He looks and sounds exactly like Rick - his own parents don't even notice the difference, for heaven's sake - but he doesn’t act like him at all. Which tells me again that he is a stranger, that he never knew me before this, and he certainly never knew Rick. He doesn't enjoy the things Rick enjoyed, he doesn’t say the sort of things Rick said. He doesn't complain, doesn't raise his voice, doesn't lie or gaslight or cheat. Frankly, he's a better husband than Rick ever was. Honestly, when I think about it like that, I'm almost tempted just to let it go. I tried to let it go, not to get caught up in worrying and just accept my new life for what it is. But I find myself unable to let it go. Because, even though this man seems ordinary and kind and reasonable, there's one thing that scares me still: 

For someone to have so confidently taken Rick's place, they would somehow have to be sure themselves that the real Rick would not return to complicate their plans (however innocent or sinister those plans may be). Whoever this man is who is calling himself "Rick", he must surely know that Rick is dead. And, if he knows that, I would bet anything that he also knows how. I've gambled with my life and my freedom before, and I don’t intend to do so again. 

A couple of you suggested that Rick might have had a twin that, for whatever reason, I never knew about, or perhaps a doppelganger who saw his chance at a more comfortable life and took it. Either of these seemed to me to be the closest to the realm of possibility, so they were the first theories I set out to confirm or disprove. A DNA test would surely be able to confirm whether this man is my husband’s twin or someone completely unrelated. Of course, I was hardly going to tell him about it: at best, he would refuse, and at worst... well, I didn’t want to find out.

So about a week after my last post, I ordered two separate DNA tests designed for finding one's relatives and ancestors and had them delivered whilst "Rick" was at work. Then, a few nights later, I waited until he was asleep - actually asleep, not half-asleep-and-staring - and I pulled out a few strands of his hair, not enough that it would be noticeable in the morning but sufficient amount to send away in a little tube to be analysed. Much to my relief, he didn’t wake up; I'm not sure how I would have explained it if he had. I sent the hair away to the DNA test companies, and they told me I'd have to wait a couple of weeks for the results. And in those couple of weeks, things have gotten... stranger, shall we say. 

You see, I've noticed that "Rick" never seems to eat of his own accord. Like, he'll make dinner for us both, but that seems more to do with when I mention that I'm hungry than with his own desire to eat. He doesn't snack between meals, he never goes for a glass of water. I don’t even think he takes anything with him to work for lunch. There's something else too: Rick's beard-trimmer is still in its box, exactly where he left it six months ago, covered in dust and quite obviously unused. And yet "Rick" has been home for nearly a month and his beard doesn't seem to be any longer, even though he used to trim it twice a week. On top of that, the staring has become a frequent occurrence, and not just in the middle of the night: I catch him watching me during the day too, always looking away or laughing it off whenever I notice him doing it. 

Anyway, I might as well tell you why I'm writing this now, because I can't make head nor tail of the situation anymore. The DNA tests came back in the mail this afternoon, before "Rick" came home from work. I opened them quickly, eager to see who was included in the list of relatives, whether there were any names I recognised. Either way it would answer my question. 

Only, I don't have an answer. All I have are more questions. Because the first test came back as inconclusive, with a note from the company telling me I had to send them a viable hair sample in order for it to work. I didn't understand that; I'd cut the hair myself, after all. And what did they mean by "viable"?  

But it was the second test that concerned me the most: where there should have been information about demographic and regional origin, there was nothing, only a line of printed black letters spelling out the word UNKNOWN. Where there should have been a list of relatives and ancestors, there was no one. 

Not just no one related to Rick; no, I mean no one. 

According to the DNA test, this man has no relatives. No family, no ancestors, no biological connections near or distant. That should be impossible, right? How can a person exist without any kind of relation? And how can he come from nowhere? 

I'm typing this up on the computer in the study, with several tabs open on various Google searches as I try to figure out how this could be possible. The DNA test lies on the table behind me, taunting me with the evidence of everything I do not know. And then I hear it, clear as day, coming from the doorway behind me.

"Rebecca?" 

If I didn't know better, I'd say my heart stopped. I would know that voice anywhere. 

I never heard him come in, never even heard the door open. Dimly, in the back of my mind, I recall that our door creaks every time it opens. How could I not have heard it? 

I turn over my shoulder towards not-Rick, a false bright smile on my face. He is not smiling. His face is calm, but there's something hard about the line of his mouth that sets me on edge. 

"What the hell is this?" 

 His voice is perfectly level, but something about it makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. There's an undertone to his voice that I haven’t noticed before now, something low and subtly grating. Even the real Rick never sounded like that.

 He holds something up, one eyebrow arched. When I see what he's holding, my stomach plummets:

 The results of the DNA test.

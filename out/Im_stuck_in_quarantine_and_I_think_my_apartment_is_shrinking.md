Day 1
What’s up, bitches! OMG, can you believe that I am finally doing it? Okay, so if you don’t follow me and read my previous blogs (uhm, like why not??) then I’ll give you the quickie update. I am FINALLY doing it, I am moving across the country to pursue my goal of becoming an actress! Can you believe it?? It totally wouldn’t be possible without all the love from my fans and followers. Love y’all lots. Well, I’m getting off the plane now, I’ll update later. Wish me luck!



Day 2 
Wow, guys, just wow. I knew I’d be downsizing when I moved here, but I had NO idea how much! It’s like living in a box! Let me give you a little rundown of my new place. I think it’s like 350 square feet, which is freaking small! It’s a studio, but it doesn’t even have a door on the bathroom, just a shower curtain! And the bathroom itself is like a toilet in a shower… I could literally shower while sitting on the toilet! Ewwww! (And no, you can’t have pictures!) But I feel fortunate, because some of the apartments here don’t even have their own bathroom. They have to SHARE with other people. Wow, WTF. Also, there’s no kitchen. It has a microwave, a mini fridge, and a small sink. It’s fine, y’all know I can’t cook worth a shit! Well we all know that this shit is just temporary, my big break is coming soon. I can feel it! I’ve got some job interviews today, so peace out, y’all! 



Day 6
OMG! My inbox has been blowing up! I know you all luv me so much (and I luv you too, bitches!) but I’ve been waaaaaay too busy to respond! Okay, so here’s the deal. I got two part time jobs. One is a waitress (yasss, free food!) and the other is at a gym (yasss, free membership!). I’ve also met with my new **agent** who is trying to find me some acting jobs. OMG, I am FREAKING out. Everything here is so crazy and new! I’m not gonna lie, I’m a little worried about money. If y’all feel like venmoing me a little something you know I’d be forever grateful. Okay, I need to go to sleep now, I feel EXHAUSTED! 




Day 7
I have never lived in an apartment before, and let me tell you it’s freaking NOISEY! I swear the people above me have like 6 kids or something because all I heard is ‘thump, thump, BANG!’ All day long! And the people next to me must looooooove crappy rap music, because they blast it night and day! At least I’m not in my apartment very much to hear it. 



 
Day 8 
Y’all been hearing about this virus? People around here have been talking, but I think it’s just overhyped. Special Shoutout to LuvBear1313251 for the SUPER SWEET donation. And others, too. My fans R the best! 




Day 10 
Y’all, I’ve got an audition tomorrow! It’s just a small role in a commercial, but I’m gonna nail it, you know it! I’ll keep you updated! Luvs! 




Day 12 
Wow, so people are getting real nervous about this virus! I just heard the schools are closing! Where was a damn virus when I was in school, right? Hahaha, don’t worry, y’all. I ain’t worried. 




Day 15 
So the restaurant and the gym I was working at have closed. And they are telling us we need to stay home. Wow, wtf. What am I gonna do in this tiny ass apartment?? I ran to the store today, but it was slim pickings! I was able to get a box of cereal, but no milk. I got some pasta, but no sauce. And I got a few cans of soup. It’s not even the lower sodium kind. Ugh! 




Day 17
Guys, do you have any idea how hard it is to work out in a small ass apartment like mine? Well, let me tell you. IT SUCKS! I tried doing some burpees and jumping jacks, but the people below me were flipping their shit. Ugh. I guess I’ll just have to stick with walking around and yoga? Y’all know my daily step goal is 20,000. It takes me 9 steps to cross my apartment. Do you know how many laps I have to do a day?! No one does, the math is IMPOSSIBLE! 



Day 18 
This crappy rap music from next door is actually growing on me! The bass is great, but they must have turned it down, because it sounds softer today. The kids upstairs aren’t thumping around as much either… maybe I’m losing my hearing. 




Day 20 
I’m really wishing I had bothered to get damn WIFI in my apartment. I was mooching off the restaurant downstairs, but it looks like they have officially closed. I only have so much data on my phone and I never even bothered to bring a TV! Anyone got suggestions for how to stay busy? I’m going CA-RAZY!



Day 25 
Thank you to those who are suggesting different things to do at my home. Unfortunately I didn’t bring any books, any art supplies, or crafting supplies and the stores are all closed. I’ve been spending lots of time looking out my puny window, but there’s not even any people to people watch! I guess I’ll just focus on my acting skills! 




Day 30
No joke, I feel like I’m losing it a little.  Today I was mindlessly walking back and forth in my apartment, when my foot hit the wall at 8 steps instead of 9. I tried again, over and over, but I could only get to 8 steps. It’s weird… maybe my feet are getting bigger? I can’t afford to buy all new shoes!



Day 32 
So I’m hearing these noises at night and not the normal ‘noisy neighbors in an apartment’ noises, but like… grinding? Like heavy furniture being moved? I also can’t hear my neighbors as well. I know that most people would say that’s a plus, but TBH I kind of felt like I wasn’t so alone when I could hear them. Ugh. Do I sound crazy? 




Day 35 
I’m officially worried about food. I ran out of my little pitiful stash of food and when I tried to go to the store, it was closed with a big sign that says ‘Out of Stock.’ I tried to find a delivery restaurant, but my phone won’t seem to connect. Luckily y’all know that I’m a big fan of protein bars, so I’ll survive for a little while. But I miss fresh fruit! 

It’s weird because being outside felt…wrong. There were no other people and I just wanted to get home so badly. 




Day 36
I haven’t been walking around my apartment as much lately. I’ve tried to go outside to walk, but I just have this terrible feeling of dread when I try to leave my apartment. Oh god, imagine if I become agoraphobic! But today I DID try… and I could only count 7 steps from one end of the apartment to the other… Also I’m still hearing those noises. Scrapping, especially at night. Do you think there’s construction going on? The music from next door is completely gone. I almost miss the heavy bass now. 




Day 40 
Holy shit, y’all I have the BEST MOM! She shipped me a package with some awesome goodies and food! Thank you, mommy, I love you! 




Day 45
My package arrived! I should be super excited… but something really weird happened today. When I opened my apartment door to grab the box, the door wouldn’t open all the way, like it was stuck on something. I shimmied the box in and closed the door, planning to inspect it after I opened the box. Later when I went to examine the door I noticed… this sounds crazy… but the door hinge is gone… like the wall is now where the door hinge used to be. I tried to open the door again, but it won’t open at all anymore. That’s crazy, right? I’m going to try to call the super intendent today. 




Day 46 
Are you guys still getting these?? I can’t seem to call out anymore, or connect to the internet. My front door, it’s just gone. Like the wall has swallowed it. I can only see my doorknob now. I counted the steps across my apartment and confirmed that it now only takes 6 steps to cross. My showerhead has disappeared into the wall as well. It’s literally like the building is closing in on me. What do I do? 




Day 48 
My bathroom has disappeared; a white wall now stands where it used to be. I panicked and began to drag all my food into the middle of the room. My microwave has disappeared and some of my things that were near the walls are gone. This is… not right. 




Day 49 
I awoke to the grinding noises again. This time I saw, I FUCKING SAW the walls moving. They have started covering my window now. As soon as I saw that I broke the glass and started screaming outside. But no one is there. I cut my hand. It really hurts. Please, please, if you’re reading this help me. 




Day 50 
I spent so much time kicking, hitting, and trying to break down the walls. I’ve fucked my foot up. My hands hurt, but still my room shrinks. I can only manage five steps from one side to the other. I scream all day and night, until I am hoarse, but no one hears. Please, someone send help. Please. 



Day 51
 My window was gone when I woke up today. A single light illuminates the room, but the walls have eaten the switch. I am so alone and scared. Why why why why why. 




Day 53?
I am now confined to my mattress. The grinding noise has become constant. The walls are moving all the time. It’s not much longer. 




Day ??
I thought the apartment would crush me, but now I know it plans to eat me. My feet are gone… sucked into the wall. I try to wiggle my toys, but I can’t feel anything. The ceiling has descended. I am cramped, breathing the recycled hot stinky air of my breath and body odor. I’m trapped. 



??????
The top of my phone is gone. I can type bot I can’t see the light is gun it is dark. My battery will die soon will I die to?

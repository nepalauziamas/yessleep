 It was the final time I left that job. Picking up trash on the side of the road, cleaning old ladies' dishes, and sanitizing bushes so the Clamtons' feel at ease. I felt odd because from all the strange events I've seen, I believe the three-headed feline was the worst, mostly because of how unsettling it looked at me.

The head that stared directly at me had the face of a man, but the body of a lion. It had the lion's head, ears and front legs but the rest of the body was covered in a mane. The cat's body was bigger than a regular lion and much more menacing. The eyes were completely yellow, no pupils or irises whatsoever. I also noticed that it had a few bumps on its head. Two on the left and two on the right. Like a human's. It also had long, sharp claws that looked unnatural for a lion. The owner of the house must have noticed the strange look on my face because he quickly diverted my attention by saying, "Don't worry about it. It watches all the time, but it never does anything. Just ignore it."

But it was hard to ignore, especially when you were the only one in the house with the cat undoubtedly staring at you. I tried to focus on the cleaning, but all I could do was stare at the cat and then look away. The cat seemed to be staring at me the whole time.

A few minutes passed and I wasn't able to ignore it any longer. I walked over to the table and picked up a book. I told the owner that I would clean the book in the bathroom and left the cat in the room. The cat immediately got up and followed me. I tried to ignore it but the cat didn't seem to care. It kept meowing. The owner chuckled and said, "It seems to like you. It wants to go with you. You should let it."

I walked over to the bathroom, but the cat still followed. Then I went to the other side of the room and sat at a chair facing the door but the cat still followed.

I kept moving around trying to find a place where the cat wouldn't follow but it kept walking over to me. Every time I moved, the cat moved with me. I sat at a chair that was against the wall but I wasn't sitting down for long before the cat tried to sit on my lap. I pushed it off and it ran to the bedroom. The cat must have done this before because the owner of the house didn't seem to think anything was strange. He asked if I wanted water and I accepted. I was parched from all the running I had to do to avoid the cat.

The owner went to the kitchen and I stood up. It was the only time I stood up in that living room and the cat didn't follow me. I grabbed a pillow, walked over to the bedroom, and set it in its place. Then I grabbed another pillow and left the bedroom. I didn't even notice the cat was on top of my pillow until I was a few feet away from the bedroom. I was struck by how large the cat was. It was at least three times bigger than a regular lion.

I was too stunned to move; I was frozen in place. The cat slowly approached me and stared at me. It didn't make a sound and it didn't seem hostile. All it did was stare. I stared back. The cat slowly crept up to me, I backed up a little. The cat approached me again, I backed up again. Eventually, I ran out of space and I was cornered. I didn't want to go back into the living room because the owner would surely come out of the kitchen and see the cat on my pillow. He would surely ask me questions, and I honestly didn't know what to say.

The cat slowly approached me and I backed up. The cat kept moving forward and I kept backing up until I was at the hallway that led to the front door. I tried to run back into the living room by going around the cat but it was too quick for me. It turned around and rushed to the bedroom. I thought that the cat would just hide in the bedroom for a while, but it kept coming out. It went into the other room, downstairs, and even into the dining room. The cat started to frighten me and I tried to get out of the house as fast as I can. I didn't even get a chance to ask the owner of the house if I could have my money. I ran out the door and never came back.

I've been wondering why the cat bothers me so much. Why it wants to follow me so much. I wasn't able to inspect the cat's body like I wanted to but the reason why it annoys me is because I think it's trying to communicate with me. I don't know how but it can speak to me. I didn't hear it speak but there was something about the cat's intentions that told me it was trying to communicate. It was trying to communicate with me. And I don't know what it was trying to say. I'm guessing that the bumps on its head had something to do with its communication. I think it wants to tell me something.

But I can't talk to cats, even if I wanted to.

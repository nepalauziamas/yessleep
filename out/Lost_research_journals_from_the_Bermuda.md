The following was found in an old journal log belonging to a man named Emit Belldom, a Scientist for an unknown Island research outpost. The leather bound journal had been floating in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, about a mile or so away from the Bermuda Triangle.

I’ve just arrived at the newest facility and I must say, it is quite an impressive outpost, however the connection to the outside work is a bit spotty, this is to be expected given our location however. Today marks our first day researching the triangle and all its anomalous traits as closely as possible. In fact the outpost is stationed on an Island  just on the outskirts of it. We plan to take semi-regular manual dives, at least 3 a month. The exploration team isn’t exactly thrilled about this task, but they will be very well equipped for the job, sent in groups of 7, and will be under for no more than 2 hours. Today's task is simply setting up, but once that is complete the head researchers will all meet so we may discuss our first course of action. I will admit the setting is rather unnerving. Being surrounded by so much mystery is definitely a little unsettling, but it’s far more intoxicating.

Well this is certainly strange. We gathered this morning to discuss our future plans at this research facility when we suddenly picked up something through the radio. It was far too jumbled and broken up to be understandable, making it all the more stranger. We are currently rerunning the audio and trying to analyze it, but it has been quite the task.

What we have discovered here today is something I don’t even think I have fully comprehended yet. We were able to decode the broadcast. What we received was an “S.O.S” message from a man named Tucket, Captain of a small cargo ship named “the camel back”…claiming to be sending the S.O.S out on July 12th...1938. We frantically attempted to find a frequency for it but couldn’t find one, and I don’t mean we can’t read it, I mean that all our readings claim there was never a frequency to be found. On top of this we had absolutely no signal so receiving any kind of radio message would be unlikely, especially one from the past. We’ve as of now, assessed it was perhaps an old recording miraculously playing out from the sunken ship, and are planning our first manual exploration first thing in the morning.

The exploration team just returned not long ago and their discoveries have only brought us more questions. After some searching they were able to find “The camel back” and the ship was in perfect condition, judging from the photos taken it doesn’t even show any signs of  rust or decay. Stranger than this was what they found inside…absolutely nothing, as if the ship was completely stripped. No cargo, equipment, furniture, resting quarters, absolutely nothing. This included the crew, not a single one could be found in or near the ship, including Capt.Tucket, the man who supposedly sent the S.O.S, which brings me to the strangest, and most alarming discovery of all. The ship had no radio system, nor was it equipped to even hold one. They also made a few other strange discoveries unrelated to the mysterious radio transmission, most noticeably large, Bioluminescent invertebrates that seem to be a strange hybrid of jellyfish and squid. They attempted to bring one back for testing but the moment they got too close the creatures would pop like a balloon, and reform itself farther away. We’ve determined them to be harmless, or at the very least they are afraid of humans.

we received another S.O.S call, this time we were able to track the supposed transmission. This one from a fighter pilot. He gave no name or date, simply that “something” shot him out of the sky…over 80,000 kilometers in the air, directly above the outposts research building. We plan on sending exploration group theta down for another dive shortly to search for any possible caves or revenines within the Island we’re stationed on, if only to quell our own curiosities

(entry 2)

Each day here is a complete anomaly that we are struggling to find answers to. We’ve discovered the Island we have been stationed on, is no island at all, but more so an island sized boulder. essentially like a stone iceberg. On top of this it is completely hollow with a few small entryways in, and contained inside are hundreds of ships and planes lost at sea. Furthermore many of these crafts are extremely advanced, some of which with weaponry we have never even seen before. From what little data we could gather some of these airfighers are…well there’s no other way to put it but, from the future, some reaching up to nearly half a century. Much like the camel back , these ships show no signs of human life. I truly don’t know what to make of any of this…much much more research must be done here.

an earthquake happened last night while we were asleep, as we awoke to shot violent tremors, as well as several carcasses belonging to the strange jellysquid. We’ve tested the waters and air, showing no signs of contamination to suggest poisoning. On the bright side we are now able to run some tests on the creatures. While it’s unfortunate we were unable to retrieve a living specimen but we will take what we can. 

(entry 2)

The test results have returned and may very well put us all in the history books for this discovery. These creatures share absolutely no genetic relations to any other living species on this planet. Couple this with the fact these creatures have additional organs that can not be compared to any other existing internal organs, the idea these things may be of another world, or at the very least, a life form undiscovered for millions of years. With this discovery, along with the earthquake that occurred, we’ve decided to drill into the ground, and mine some more possible new discoveries,

Date: October 12th, 1985

I fear we may have made a grave mistake. Shortly after drilling into what we thought was some kind of stone, we were hit with a long wave of short tremors, and once we began extracting the drill…a thick blue liquid began spewing from the freshly created wound. Once the drill was fully removed we got to studying the Islands crust. No minerals, or dirt, or sand…but pulsating, slimy, organic flesh like material. Even after further study this hard rock like surface is more akin to hardened skin, almost like an exoskeleton. Our group has come to a crossroads. Half of us believe we must stay in the name of science, these discoveries are potentially groundbreaking. The other half, reasonably enough, fear we’ve awoken something, and plan to resign from the project and return home. Against my better judgment, I’ve chosen the former. I have dedicated my whole life to studying these oceans and the mysteries that calls them home, and this may very well be the breakthrough of my life.

Everyone left this morning, including all expedition teams. At the moment there’s five researchers left including me, three engineers, and a handful of security. The sudden quiet and emptiness of our base is certainly a bit unnerving, but has made working in peace much easier. Due to our lack of exploration equipment, and units, the remainder of our research will be done on the Islands surface. We’re aware it is hollow on the inside, so we plan to drill all the way through, and reach the large cave at the islands core

(entry 2)

This will be the final entry, as well as my final words. The rest of the group was right to flee when we discovered we were stationed on top of a living mass, but we had to keep pushing for more until we inevitably awoken the beast we’ve been residing on for the past week, and now it’s begun to swallow us into its stomach, full of relics from its former meals. It was as if our outpost had sunken downward at extreme speed, before dropping us among the pile of fallen ships and planes, like a child tossing a toy back into their toy bin. The drop has killed most of the remaining group, the few who survived are in terrible shape. I write this while pinned down under a steel table, as the sound of water filling the cave surrounds our destroyed building. Judging by the rate in which the cave is filling, I’d guess the creature is currently submerging into the depths of the ocean, meaning the few of us remaining will most likely drown within the next ten minutes. If somehow these notes make it to someone else’s hands, please for the love of god, don’t try looking for us

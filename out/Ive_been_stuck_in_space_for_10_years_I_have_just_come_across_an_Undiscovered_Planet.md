Is this thing working?

Is it- Okay, it's on.

I don't know how to start this. First of all, it's been a while since I've been down on Earth. What's it like down there now? The last time I was down there, people were freaking out about the world ending- or something like that. Second of all, if you're wondering how I'm posting this, I was finally able to connect the laptop I'm currently using on this spacecraft to any resemblance of internet access, even if the connection is poor. Thank god for this satellite I found in the middle of this galaxy. If the writing isn't that great, then my apologies, there's no gravity in here, and it's atrocious.

It gets lonely out here in space. I wasn't sent out with anybody else, so I'm just out here by myself. Originally I was sent on a mission because we received some signals from the moon, and I was required to go check it out on command of NASA. My spacecraft was launched into space, blasting its way towards the moon, shooting past the many stars in the dim, empty void that is space. 

Unfortunately, my spacecraft malfunctioned, and it took a wild turn right. I was unable to orbit it back to its original direction, and in my attempts to turn it back, I accidentally caused it to go faster, making me go deeper in space with no way back. It wasn't until what felt like hours until it finally stopped, and the spacecraft was just floating in space. I looked out the front windows and saw no planets in sight. I was lost in space.

I have tried contacting NASA through the spacecraft multiple times, even through my radio, trying to get some help out to me so I can finally go back to Earth, but every single time I've tried calling or sending a signal to them, it either never goes through, or the line gets broken. My radio stopped working at one point, and it hasn't since. Sometimes I wonder if they even noticed that I've been gone.

I don't know how I've survived so long out here. I have an extraordinary amount of food stored in the spacecraft. It seems that they stashed way more food here than intended, but after 10 years, it's finally running out, and the remaining food that's left may only last me another 2 weeks. My water supply is also getting low, which is making me start to panic.

I'm not here to talk about me possibly dying soon, though. In my 10 years up here, I can confirm that space is what scientists say it is; an endless void. One might call it a wasteland. For so many years, knowing that I was far deeper in space than any astronaut has ever gone, I've tried finding undiscovered planets, and any sign of intelligent life, but I never have. 

I've flown by the occasional 'big' star, but not a planet. I've seen some weird shit, though. One time I saw what looked like flying black goo flying past by spacecraft with needles sticking out of it, and the time I flew by a star that looked like it had a face on it, with eyes that were watching my every move. It took way too long to fly past it, and it terrified me. It wasn't doing anything, but I guess the deeper in space you get, the more fucked up things are.

That's how gigantic space really is. You can be out here for as long as I have and still not come across any planets. If you're wondering if I've seen Jupiter or Saturn, I regret to inform you that I have not, as I flew way off the solar system. It would be cool to see them in person, though.

***Blip.***

I got a notification from the computer system at the very front of the spacecraft. I had been asleep, so the blaring beeping noise jolted me awake, my eyes dry and my neck itchy. I blink a couple of times, almost unable to adjust to my surroundings. After being on this ship for nearly 10 years, I'd be used to it by now.

I exited my sleep quarter and floated to the front, the beeping still ringing in my ear, nearly deafening me. When I made it to the computers, I squinted at the lit-up screen as I shut off the beeping, bringing the spacecraft back to silence. I looked closely at the screen. It read, "Unknown Planet Detected."

I read this and nearly jumped out of my skin in excitement. I turned my head to look out the viewport. In the distance, what looked mere yards away, was indeed a planet. A planet that I had not recognized.

Actually seeing it made me more excited. After years of being stuck in space alone, with no help on the way, years of seeing nothing, I had finally come across- no, discovered, a new planet. I took a closer look at it, holding my enthusiasm a bit longer.

It looked around the same size as Neptune, maybe slightly smaller. The planet looked mostly grey, with a wide streak of orange across the left side of it. It even looked like it had a big hole near the middle of it, just like Jupiter. It was a beauty to look at and left me in awe for at least 5 minutes. We knew there were planets just dying to be discovered throughout the entire galaxy, but I had finally found one, and it was almost worth the 10 years being up here,

I snapped out of my excitement, turning back to the desk and reaching for the computer. I swiped to view the atmosphere status. 78.54 percent nitrogen, 21.10 percent oxygen, and 0.36 percent argon. Nearly the same calculations as Earth. It even had a similar ozone to Earth, and even had a near exact same carbon dioxide level as Earth, with this planet's carbon dioxide being 413.66 parts per million. It was habitable, and my spacecraft could go through the atmosphere with no issue.

Jack-fucking-pot.

I swiped across the computer again to see the other message it provided. It read, "2 unknown objects around the atmosphere."

I took my eyes off the glaring computer screen, looking out the viewport again and surveying the planet's atmosphere, nearly getting my eyes lost in the planet's beauty multiple times. I hadn't seen anything around it. It seemed like my ship was the only thing near it.

I sat in the pilot's seat and powered on the ship, hearing it buzz for a few moments before I heard the engine click. I started moving the ship forward, hearing the fuel come out. I don't know how the fuel has lasted so long, but nonetheless, I orbited the ship towards the planet, every second I flew towards it, I felt the pressure of the atmosphere slam against the ship.

I was moments away from crash landing on the planet. I glanced to my left and saw what looked like bones floating around, rotating with every movement. Even with how dark space is, you can still see everything clearly. The bones horrified me at first, but I kept going. They didn't even look like human bones. They were too bent, bumpy, and ragged to be a person's.

The ship continued boosting towards the planet, with it inching closer every millisecond. I got farther into the atmosphere and gritted my teeth as the power it had nearly knocked me out of my seat. The speed of the ship got faster, speeding through it until I was eventually fully on the planet.

I didn't have time to look at the planet's features, as I had to land the ship. I slowed the ship down as it continued to spiral down to the ground. I braced the landing as it crashed into the ground, making me shake around upon the impact, and I heard the fuel sizzle out as I turned the engine off. I took a deep breath as I looked out the viewport once more, taking in the new surroundings.

The sky was dark, almost virtually just black, with no clouds in sight. There wasn't much more I could see from inside the ship, so I got up and went back to my quarter, where I stored my spacesuit. While the oxygen and nitrogen levels were nearly identical to Earth's, I wasn't going to take any chances going out without one.

I quickly slipped it on, almost instantly. It used to be extremely hard to get on, but after being up here for so long and going on many spacewalks, I knew the quickest ways to get one on.

After getting the suit on, I noticed that it didn't feel like there was gravity anymore. I felt still, and I wasn't floating anywhere. I wasn't used to this, so it alarmed me for a minute as I walked to the door, grabbing the needed equipment. I popped it open, seeing it slowly open up for me to exit the ship. I took a deep breath as I stepped out of the ship, stepping onto this planet so far out in our galaxy.

The first thing I did was survey the ground. It was a rocky surface but flat enough for me to walk around easily. I took a quick look around. The planet was miles wide, so I couldn't see the entirety of it, of course, but from what I saw, it wasn't the civilization as I thought it was, and instead had loads of empty land, occasionally filled up with small buildings that almost looked like stations. There were definitely beings living here.

As I took a step, I still didn't feel gravity pushing me upwards like it would on other planets, which, I should've guessed, considering the calculations.

I took more steps forward, feeling the rocks on the ground crack under my feet with my movements. I continued walking, looking for more to see, but there was nothing. I hadn't seen any signs of life yet, and the only buildings I saw were the same small stations with no signs of any entrances.

My eyes continued wandering around, because while I was disappointed with the lack of sights to see, it was still so cool to see that other planets existed.

As I took a step, I heard what sounded like an engine roaring from above me. It almost sounded like a jet at full speed. I put my hands on opposite sides of my helmet to try and block out the noise, but I couldn't. I felt the noise getting lower and lower. The pitch and sheer volume of it, made it unbearable to continue listening to. 

When I looked up to investigate what the noise was coming from, my mouth dropped agape, and my heart started hammering.

It was a UFO, hovering in the air just feet away from me, flashing a bright white light at me as it slowly landed on the ground, and the light stopped.

Nothing came out of the UFO for a minute, but I was still in so much shock, as a revelation came to me. I have just seen a real-life UFO. If UFOs were real, then that means...

I saw the top of the UFO pop open, tipping over and making a large exit. From the inside, I saw multiple green and blue flashing lights with weird clawing noise coming from the rugged metal of the UFO. 

I watched as 3 cloaked figures climbed out of the UFO at the same time, all walking a few inches from me, standing in a line, just looking at me. I squinted to get a better look at them. They were all wearing dark blue cloaks, and their eyes were larger than life. Their heads were shaped like a more squeezed-in oval, and all three of them had tentacles coming from their back. The color palette of their skin was complicated, as it was a mixture of black, green, and dark orange. These were real-life aliens.

They all turned to face one another and started speaking to each other in a language that I can't even decipher. It sounded like gibberish mixed in with the clicking of their tongues. I started getting afraid, feeling the need that I had to get out of there. 

Suddenly, they all stopped communicating with each other as one of them stepped forward toward me. It looked at me and I looked back, staring into each other's eyes. I was then struck with the fear of being in front of an alien creature, not knowing what it was capable of and what it would do to me.

After what felt like hours of just standing there, it eventually cleared its throat and spoke to me; "You must be a human," it sounded... Human, but also sounded gargled and raspy.

I slowly nodded my head, stuttering as I tried to say something. "Well- I- Uh- I... Um... Yes, I am," I eventually get the words out. I see the alien crack a slimy smile. I shivered.

It pointed at my helmet. "You can take your helmet. There's oxygen on this planet," It said to me. I smiled awkwardly as I slid off my helmet, setting it on the ground. There was oxygen there, it was right. The air smelt moist and smoky, though. It smelt so bad it made me almost vomit.

The alien motioned for me to follow it, and I obliged. I jogged beside it as the other aliens followed close behind. We walked across multiple stations, and as I walked through the planet more, I saw much more things than I once perceived. There were many more stations, all albeit the same size, and there was the occasional tiny earthquake.

The alien turned to face me and reached out its hand. I took it and shook it, regretting it almost instantly as it felt extremely slimy and rough. I took my hand away in disgust. "You can call me Quinto,' it said. I nodded. I was at a loss for words. I still couldn't believe what was happening. Quinto started speaking again to ask me something. "How did you discover this place, hm?"

I looked at Quinto and noticed the other 2 aliens behind us looking closely at me. I started feeling a little more comfortable, but I still felt fear setting in me. I thought about Quinto's question before answering; "I was on a mission to check out a signal coming from the moon 10 years ago, and my ship malfunctioned, and it went way out of the solar system, and I uh..." I looked around the planet. "Came across this place after so many years,"

"Oh," Quinto sounded nearly disappointed in saying that. Quinto turned and started speaking to the aliens again in their language. Again, I didn't understand what they were saying. Quinto turned back to me. "Humans weren't supposed to find this place," He finally says to me. I gave him a confused expression as we started approaching a large building that had now come into view.

"Why?" I simply asked back, genuinely confused. Why weren't humans supposed to come to this planet? Were they hiding something? My questions were being raised as Quinto gave me an off-putting stare.

"Because if humans found this planet, they would get in the way of our... Plan," Quinto hesitates before saying. He eyes me as we get closer to the building. As we continued getting closer, I figured out that it was some sort of laboratory. Quinto keeps going with his sentence. "But since you seem trustworthy, I'll tell you what we're thinking,"

"But why? What's so different about telling me?" I say as we stop in front of the entrance. Quinto turns, looking at the other 2 aliens before looking back at me.

"Because your ship had an error and got lost in space, correct?" He dead eyes me. I nod my head. "And nobody came out to try and save you?"

"Well, yeah, but-"

"Exactly," Quinto cuts me off. He turns to a pad near the door. He presses his hand against it, lighting it up green as the doors in front of us slide open, revealing a long hallway. We step into the building as the doors behind us slide close. The hallway was lit by a bright blue light, one of the lights on the ceiling flickering on and off. I looked to the floor. The floor was dark, but there were cyan spots scattered across.

We started walking across the hall, the end of it was dark but as we started walking further, it lit up and I saw that this led to another room. The hallway was cramped, causing me and Quinto to almost squeeze together. I managed to move my eyes behind me and saw the other aliens in a line behind us.

We made it to the end of the hall and took a step down into the room. I didn't watch my step and I nearly tripped stepping down, grunting in the process. I heard one of the other aliens start chuckling, but it didn't sound like a laugh. It sounded like a cough if you had a damaged voice box.

I examined the room. It was large and shaped like a circle. Throughout the room, there were 4 room entrances, all with no doors. The room was simple. In the middle, it was a tall platform with wide steps up to it with a chair on it, almost like those chairs you lay in at dentist offices. Next to it was a large stand with multiple tools on it and across from it was a computer hanging from the ceiling. 

There was an LED screen at the end of the room, showing the temperature of something. I squinted at it. Above the temperature, it read "Limintonyo." I assumed that's what the name of this planet was called. The temperature was 73°.

I saw Quinto point to the screen. "We can change the temperature of this planet with that. It's complicated, so I don't want you touching it," Quinto started walking to a doorway to another room. I quickly followed suit, not able to check out the room much further.

The next room we went into was an average-sized room with a large computer system across from us, even more complicated than the one in my spacecraft. There was a tall metal shelf next to it and a random pod sitting around the doorway as well. I stood back and stared at the technology in front of me. Quinto and the other aliens got in front of the computers to catch my attention. I snapped out of it and focused.

"This is where I want to tell you our plan," Quinto said, this time with more urgency and seriousness in his voice. He laid his eyes on the floor, then immediately brought them back up to me. The other 2 aliens stood by Quinto, staring at me. I was on edge seeing their eyes on me the way they were. I nodded my head at Quinto.

"O- Okay, what's your plan?" I didn't know what else to say. I saw Quinto turn around after I asked that, going to one of the computers. He pressed a button and it turned on, revealing a picture of Earth. He turned back to me.

"This is your planet," He said to me, keeping a calm demeanor. He walked up to another computer, pressing another button, this time turning on all of the computers. Every computer showed long and complicated lines of code. Code that didn't even look like javascript or python. Quinto turned back to me as I studies the code. "We spent years writing our own code, designing a weapon that will wipe out your species in an instant,"

I snapped my head and widened my eyes at him as he said that. He kept going. "This planet is just a hideout and one of our many areas to go to, that's why there's not much to see here. Bet you were expecting more when you decided to crash land here," he gives me a look. I stood still, not saying a word. "Our species were supposed to make Earth our home, our place to stay safe in, and you humans took that from us. I had to spend a lifetime mastering English and how you humans speak just to send a message to NASA, one which they all received yet ignored and left on their computers,"

I still couldn't move. I couldn't believe what he was saying. They were making a weapon to wipe out the entire human race? I was terrified, I didn't know what to do. I couldn't even think at that moment, because my mind was whirling with so many thoughts.

"You can't do that though," I was finally able to say. I saw Quinto look at me, widening his bulging eyes mockingly. He stepped forward to me, staring at me.

"And why's that?" Quinto towered over me. He hovered his tentacles over me, making me more terrified than I already was. He lowered his head, sighing. "I knew I shouldn't have told you," he muttered. He turned back to the other aliens, speaking to them in their language again, and that time, I really wished I understood what they were saying.

Quinto looked back at me and took a step back. Before I knew it, one of the aliens reached into their cloaks and pulled out a blaster, one you'd see in Star Wars, and pulled the trigger, firing a rope that got tied around me, making me unable to move.

Before I knew it, the rope suddenly started electrocuting me, shaking my body around and increasing the nerves in my body. I watched the alien who shot the rope at me put its blaster back in its cloak and Quinto lean over me as I dropped to my knees in pain. I was still being electrocuted by the rope and I felt myself beginning to pass out.

"I knew you wouldn't understand..." I heard Quinto say down to me. I couldn't say anything back. The electrocution was too much. I fell down on my face, the electrocution not stopping, and before I could do anything about it, it got too much, and I passed out below the aliens, unable to fight back.

When I woke up, I was staring up at a dark ceiling. At first, I didn't know where I was. I thought I was dead. However, when I moved my head around, I noticed that I was in the same room the hallway led to. I tried to get up but I couldn't. I looked down and noticed that I was strapped to the chair. I tried to break free but I couldn't. 

I saw one of the aliens in front of the computer, typing something into it. Horrified of my situation, I called to the alien. "HEY! I'm stuck, help me, please,"

The alien turned around and tilted its head at me. I then remembered why I was stuck in the chair in the first place. I watched the alien walk up to the stand next to the chair and I continued trying to get out of the chair, but I was tied to it GOOD. I watched the alien grab a scalpel and turn to face me. I glanced at the scalpel and yelled, knowing what the alien was going to do to me. I felt nothing but fear at that moment.

The alien leaned down and started bringing the scalpel to my forehead with no hesitation. I saw the alien's head close to mine to concentrate on what it was going to do. I couldn't move my arms, but before the blade could get closer to my head, I swung my head up as hard as I could and headbutted the alien in the face.

The alien took a step back in shock, dropping the scalpel in the process. I saw it falling near my hand, and I was able to catch it in between my fingers. I breathed a sigh of relief as I fully gripped the scalpel. I was able to twist my hand up and get the scalpel to the rope that was strapping me to the chair. I cut through the rope, and my right arm, along with most of my torso, was free.

I quickly leaned up and cut the other half of the rope off my left arm, setting me completely free.

I turned and saw the alien regain its balance and start making weird vomiting-like noises. It started to reach for something in its cloak but before I could even think, I lunged at the alien and stabbed it in the stomach with the scalpel.

I let go of the scalpel in shock that I had just used it as a weapon. I saw blood, which was green, spewing out of the wound. I watched the alien let out a blood-curdled screech before it fell to the floor, limp.

I heard movement coming from one of the rooms. It sounded like Quinto and the other alien were coming out to investigate the noise. Unsure of what to do, I went to the computer the alien was on and looked at it. I looked at the screen and saw what it was doing. It was sending a message to NASA, threatening to end humanity.

I quickly deleted the text and started typing my own. 

*"Hello. This is 0397. I was sent out on a mission to the moon 10 years ago and I got lost in space. Please help me."*

I looked to my side, and across from where I was, I saw Quinto and the other alien exiting the room they were in. I saw Quinto point at me. My heart started beating as I started trembling in fear, only god knows what they were going to do to me next. I quickly sent the message and started running for the computer room to my right.

As I ran, I looked behind me and saw the other alien high on my tail, raising some sort of electric hatchet over its head, getting ready to swing it at me.

I nearly screamed as I ran into the room. I ducked into a corner, swinging my head to the doorway in a panic. I watched the alien run into the room in pursuit of me, but to my luck, it tripped over the knocked-over pod as it came in, dropping the hatchet, and sending it skittering over to me.

I heard the alien grunt upon tripping and having impact with the ground. I looked down at the hatchet in front of me. It was lit up blue and it almost looked like a tomahawk. I saw the alien starting to get back up to its feet. I swiftly picked the hatchet back up, and as the alien was entirely up, I swung the hatchet across its chest, cutting deep into its skin and electrocuting it.

In an instant, it crashed to the floor after I struck it, shaking violently on the ground. I tossed the hatchet to the floor and stared down in horror at the dying alien. I was killing dangerous creatures, but at what cost?

I shook my head and turned away once I saw the alien starting to foam at the mouth. I stared at the multiple computer screens, inspecting the code. It was some sort of code the aliens had written themselves. I scrolled down to take better looks at it. There were multiple empty lines. It wasn't finished, therefor the weapon they were attempting to create was not finished.

Scared, I started thinking of things to do, and then I got an idea. If the computers were destroyed, then the aliens wouldn't be able to access or finish writing the code.

I searched the room in a hurry and saw a metal pipe laying on the floor. It was clear these aliens weren't good at cleaning rooms. 

I picked it up, holding it both in my hands. I looked behind me, hoping Quinto wouldn't launch a sneak attack on me. I turned back to the computers, taking a deep breath before I started bashing every computer screen with the pipe, sending glass everywhere, making sure I shattered every screen completely, *making sure* they would never turn on again.

Even when the screens were shattered, I still kept on hitting the screens, losing control of myself. I finally stopped and slammed the pipe to the floor, breathing heavily. I looked at my work. Every single computer was smashed to pieces. Every. Single. *Fucking.* One.

I stepped over the alien's body as I stepped out of the room, feeling victorious, forgetting about the situation I was in. As I approached the hallway and went to step up, I looked behind me and saw Quinto standing at the far end of the room, standing in front of the LED screen.

I stepped away from the hallway and looked at the screen as Quinto had his hand on it. The temperature still said 73 degrees.

"I'm not here to talk about the weather with you," I yelled at him. No response. 

"Did you hear me?" I yelled back at him again. No response for a second time. Without saying a word, I watched as Quinto moved his hand across the screen to a tab with a row of numbers. Quinto swiped his fingers up the row, each number continuing going up as he got to the very top, the highest number it could go to. Quinto was staring at me the whole time, with hatred in his bulging eyes. I saw him press out of the row and back to the temperature screen. I read it.

180 degrees. Scorching hot.

I remembered what Quinto said about them being able to change the temperature of the planet and I stepped into the hallway in fear and panic, afraid of what my demise would be. 

"Oh fuck," I whispered to myself. I sprinted down the hallway to the door, running faster than I ever have in my life. I needed to not only get away from Quinto, but I also needed to get back to the ship before I die of a heat stroke. I got to the die and as I stood in front of it, it slid open by itself and I ran out, looking behind me and seeing Quinto beginning to run down the hall after me.

I stepped onto the rocky ground, sprinting. My spacecraft wasn't in view but I knew it wasn't too far. It wasn't too hot yet but I felt the temperature starting to raise by the second.

I heard Quinto step out of the building and continue to run faster after me. I picked up my pace, sprinting faster than before. I started getting an adrenaline rush, as I didn't feel myself getting tired. I just keep running, desperate to get out of this alive.

It started getting hotter and hotter and I started breathing harder and harder. as I ran and passed by the multiple stations, I started receiving a call from my radio. I looked behind me and saw Quinto just mere feet behind me. He was running FAST. I was beyond petrified at this point as I listened to the incoming call on my radio.

***"0397, do you copy? You were supposed to be back 10 years ago."***

My heart skipped a beat. My radio hadn't been working this whole time. I reached for my radio in my suit as fast as I could, seeing my spacecraft come into view. Quinto was still on my heels and he wasn't slowing down. It was getting so hot now, the temperature was going up fast. I felt myself begin sweating and slowing down, much to my dismay. I couldn't afford to slow down now.

"Yes... I copy," I say into my radio, tired. I dropped to my knees from my heat and all the running, but I manage to quickly get back to my feet and continue running to my spacecraft. I was so close now. "I know, my spacecraft malfunctioned and I got lost in space- just come save me! PLEASE!" I shout desperately into my radio. I shut it off, stuffing it back into my suit as I approached the spacecraft. 

It was flaming hot now, and I didn't know much longer I could be out here. I was burning, and I was screaming from the pain the heat was giving me. I felt multiple burns begin to form on my body. I was running way slower now, and I felt Quinto right on me. He hadn't slowed down once.

I picked up my helmet and went to the spaceship door and started to open it before Quinto put his hand on my neck. He started squeezing me tightly and began pulling me back closer toward him. I felt the end start to come near as the heat was starting to become unbearable. With the remaining strength and might I had, I pulled my arm forward and pulled it back, elbowing him in the ribs with everything I had.

Quinto let go and let out an animalistic scream. It wasn't a noise any human could make. I was able to open the door and crawl my body in, shutting it the moment I got in, dropping my helmet.

I heard Quinto begin to bang on the airlock door, making gargled and aggressive roars at me as he did so. I breathed a sigh of relief, knowing I was safe from Quinto for the time being and that I was out of the heat, in my ship, in the cool air.

I got up once Quinto started banging on the door harder. It started sounding like he was going to break it down any second, and spaceship doors are not built to be broken down easily. If he broke the door down, not only would he be able to come in and get me, but I also wouldn't be able to fly out into space. I would die the minute I exited this planet.

I walked into my quarter to try and find anything that I could use as a weapon. I moved my eyes around the entire quarter, looking at the many drawers that were built into the walls. I opened one of them. Nothing. I opened another. Nothing. I opened the next one. This time, there was something.

It was a gun.

Typically, you shouldn't bring a gun onto a spaceship, and I was extremely confused as to why there was one in this quarter. I assumed that whoever was in this spacecraft before me brought it with them, stored it here, and forgot about it.

Shaking, I took the gun. I stared at it, hearing Quinto bang on the door harder, his bangs even more powerful now. I had never shot a gun before, so I was nervous. I didn't even know if it was loaded. I popped the clip open to see if it had rounds. There were 4 bullets.

I popped the clip back in as I exited the quarter and made my way back to the spaceship door. Quinto was still hitting the door, and I knew if I didn't open it and open fire, the door would be gone. I unlocked the door and slowly opened it, revealing myself to Quinto. The intense heat came in instantaneously, and I saw Quinto watch the door open and take a step back. He looked up at me and let out a sadistic smile.

Quinto began going after me until he saw what was in my hand. He took a steady step back, putting his hands up. He looked up at me with pleading eyes, continuing to take steps away from me. I raised the gun and pointed it at his head. Before he knew it, and before *I* did, even though I was absolutely terrified still, I fired a shot, watching the bullet explode into his face.

Even when Quinto had fallen to the floor dead, I continued.

I fired a shot into his body.

And another.

And another.

*Click.*

I had ran out of bullets.

I threw the gun to the floor, staring at Quinto's body, seeing the green blood oozing out from his head, his eyes never moving ever again.

Staring at his lifelessness, I leaned down and closed the spaceship door again, this time not opening it again.

I slumped against the wall, breathing heavily, closing my eyes, happy that I not only saved the Earth but also made it out alive. I may've been beaten up, but the scars I had collected being on this planet didn't feel like they hurt anymore.

I reached into my suit and pulled out my radio, turning it on, hearing a message coming through. I listened.

***"Okay. Where are you? Tell us the coordinates,"*** I heard them say on the other end. My eyes lit up as I slowly slid back up to my feet and walked to the front of the ship. Once I got to the front, my legs gave out and I slammed against the computer system. I grunted in pain, raising myself back up slowly. I looked at the computer system, putting my hand on it, searching for the coordinates. Once I had gotten them, I raised my radio and told them the exact coordinates, and that I was on a different planet.

Once I had told them, I sat in my pilot's seat and waited for them to get back to me. I stared out the viewport, viewing the wasteland that was this piece of shit planet. 10 minutes passed by until I started to get another message from my radio I answered it and listened, hoping that they discovered the planet I was on.

I was beyond happy when they said ***"We received your coordinates. We don't know how long it'll take but we're sending the fastest ship out to you right now. Sit tight."***

My heart sank when they followed that up by saying ***"However, there is no planet at those coordinates. In fact, it seems there was a planet there years ago, but it exploded and left nothing behind."***

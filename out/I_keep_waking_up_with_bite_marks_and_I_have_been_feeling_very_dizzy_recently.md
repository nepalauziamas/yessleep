After Covid-19 struck, I lost my job and was forced to live of savings for a while. I have always been known to splurge my money, so the funds in my savings account were limited. The lavish three bedroom apartment penthouse I previously lived in, was becoming way out of my price range- I would need to dress down, find something less decorated and more affordable. So, obviously I was forced to vacate my home and I opt to live in something more achievable. When I found my current apartment, an old but well-kept apartment, I jumped at the opportunity.

It's been just under a month since I moved in, and I've only just made it back on my feet. I have acquired a new job and a steady income to support me. I settled into the apartment nicely, enjoying the ornate decorations splayed around. On first impression, this house seemed ideal, now I am starting to rethink this whole ordeal. Things around here are far from normal.

It all started two weeks ago when I woke up extremely worn out. Weird. Considering I went to bed at a reasonable time, this was out of the ordinary. I just dismissed my gut feeling and chalked it up to sickness. That day I had a job interview so I took some paracetamol and trucked along. When I went into the bathroom, I noticed a decent sized welt formed on my neck. I rub my eyes and looked closer, It was some sort of bite mark. *Must be bed bugs* I thought, despite the fact that the bite was quite large. I threw on a bright orange knitted scarf lazily around my neck. After the interview, I cleaned and bandaged up the wound and quickly forgot all about it.

A couple days later I woke up with another large sized bite, this time on my wrist. *Okay this is enough* I thought. I immediately rushed to the mall to purchase and new bed frame and mattress. When I got home I excitedly assembled my new bed. To my shock, the next morning I woke up absolutely exhausted and I had yet ANOTHER  bite, freshly bitten over my other wrist wound. Oh right, forgot to mention, they hurt **a lot**. I was feeling frustrated and annoyed, why was I still suffering from these irregular bites?! *Rodents. How did I not think of this sooner?* I couldn't tell whether it was a rodent or a bug, so I simply just called pest control to deal with it. But to my displeasure, they didn't find anything. **Nothing.** There was absolutely nothing in my apartment that could have caused these wretched bites.

Finally, yesterday I woke up bedridden, absolutely crippled. I could not stand nor get up at all. At some point I managed to sit up- only for me to immediately pass out for a good two minutes. Unsure what to do, I grabbed my phone and dialed myself an ambulance. 

I currently write this from the comfort (or not!) of a hospital bed. They say I have lost a lot of blood, they also said I was in a delirious state, babbling on about random crap. I don't remember any of this which checks out I guess considering I did loose quite a bit of blood. Most importantly, They found a new bite on the side of my neck. 

I have no idea what to do! They won't tell me any more info and to be completely honest, I do not think they have a clue either. Suggestions on what could be possibly happening to me is highly appreciated. I am in desperate need of help.

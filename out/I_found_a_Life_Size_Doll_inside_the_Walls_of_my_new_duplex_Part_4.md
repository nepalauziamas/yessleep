No response. 

The knife was back in my hands in less than ten seconds. 

Then I dialed 911 without hesitation. 

“What is your emergency?” the operator asked as I saw the bedroom door open on its own. 

“I need to report a break in at my address,” I said as I saw Sarah’s silhouette standing there in the doorway. 

I rattled off my information and hung up, slipping the weapon into my sleeve as I announced, “That was my partner, she’s on her way home.” 

Sarah was tracing the outline of the photo frames that had hung on the wall, nodding to herself. 

“Home. That’s a funny word isn’t it?

“I mean, I called this place home for almost two years. And then woosh, life happens. *You* happen. And well, then it’s just all taken away in an instant hmm?” 

I kept silent, wondering if she even guessed that I knew she was not the woman she claimed she was. 

“When I was a kid I used to live in this big five bedroom house. It was a dream. So much space to run around. And stairs too. As a kid I just loved running up and down the stairs. One time I fell down the stairs though. Broke my leg. You could actually see the bloody bone sticking out. I screamed, my dad ran over to see what had happened. I remember him saying it was going to be okay. That he would fix me right up. But when I woke up in the hospital and I saw my leg was whole again, it didn’t feel like I was fixed. Do you know why?”

I cleared my throat. 

“I think you should probably go,” I said. Cautious to keep a distance from her as she started down the hall.

“Because my dad sold that house. Because my mom couldn’t bare to see me struggle to walk again and popped a bottle of pills just to make it all go away. So how the hell was I ever going to be fixed?” 


 She was at the entrance to the main den now, looking around the place and saying, “This is the first place that really felt like it was home to me. The first fucking place in a very long time.”

I leaned back on the counter, keeping the blade ready as she gave me a quirky yet unsettling smile. 

“This was actually just one big house once too, you know. Four bedrooms, two baths. Absolutely almost perfect. Would’ve been everything I wanted if it included stairs,” she laughed as her fingernails traced the wall next to the temperature. Then she began to turn it down and make it colder. 

“I used to dream of stairs. Running up and down them like I did when I was a little girl. Sometimes I would close my eyes and I was sure I could hear myself on them, sure they were real.” 

“But I guess that doesn’t matter anymore now that you’re here.” Her voice was colder now too. 

“You need to go,” I said, trying to keep my voice calm and firm. 

“Sure. I wouldn’t want to disturb my home,” she said as she turned toward the front door. 



Her nails were still scratching against the wall as she started toward it. I let my guard down. I shouldn’t have said a word. I shouldn’t have.

“It’s not yours anymore,” I responded.  

In a flash she moved like lightning, shoving me against the cabinet. 

Her hands were in my eyes and mouth as I swung the knife and stabbed her in the side. 

She screamed as I shoved her back, scrambling to find another weapon as she grabbed at my feet. I hit the floor with a crack, kicking at her face as she tried to scratch at my ankles. 

Then she pulled me toward her, she had this strength that felt like I couldn’t escape. She grabbed my wrists and held me now, smiling like a wild woman. 

I struggled to move as her spit dripped on my face and she started to scratch at my face, whispering gibberish as she attacked me. 

I saw the knife still plunged in her side, and bit her arm, forcing her to let go. In the next split second I grabbed the knife and pulled it out. Then I stabbed it in her again. Again and again and again. Toward her chest and her neck, anything to get her off. 

Sarah pushed away, crawling toward the wall as I squeezed the knife harder looking down at my blood covered clothes. 

Sarah started to talk louder, speaking like a damn demon as she crawled up against the wall, reaching for the temperature gauge again. Making it as cold as possible.

“Get the fuck out of my house!!!” I shouted as I waved the knife toward her. 

She responded by crawling over toward me like a fucking spider, catching me off guard and throwing me to the top of the table. The knife slid onto the floor by the bathroom door as she started to slam her fists against me, again pushing her nails into my skin to draw fresh blood. 

“My house. My house. My house. MY HOUSE.” Sarah screamed as I used every ounce of energy I had to throw her off. She tumbled backward and hit the wall by the hallway as I jumped across the table and got the knife.  This time I was the one that didn’t hesitate. I grabbed her hair and slammed her against the fake wall, her head smashing through. Then I stabbed the blade straight into her heart. 

Sarah’s eyes widened in shock as she looked down at her open wound as I watched her crumple to the floor. 

Then her body began to twitch, and she began to cough and shake. It looked like she was having a seizure. 

I couldn’t tear my eyes away from her. Watching as she began to shake even more violently. Her back spasming as I heard bones breaking. Then she began to lock up, her legs pushing together and her hands freezing in place. Her eyes became huge and she gasped a final breath as something slowly crawled its way over her skin. 

It looked like plastic. 

No, it *was* like plastic. 

Sarah now resembled a doll. 

I stared down at the lifeless thing, shaking and trembling as I looked down at my hands and feet covered in blood. 

What the fuck had I just seen. 

There was a knock on the door and I jumped. 

I had completely forgotten that I had called the police. 

When I opened the door, two officers were speechless staring at my bloodsoaked silhouette. 

“I could have used you five minutes ago.”

______

Twenty minutes later, they finished taking pictures of the scene and I gave the best damn lie that I could to explain what had happened. I claimed that I’d had a break in, and that the perpetrator had run. 

They asked a few questions about the doll, but it was clear they were more weirded out by it than anything. And it’s not like I was about to explain what really happened and wind up in the loony bin. 

“I uh… don’t suppose you could get rid of it for me?” I asked them as they finished taking a statement. 

“Ma’am that’s not our business,” the first officer commented and then let me know that they would keep a car parked out front until the evening. 

After they were gone I couldn’t stop staring at Sarah. Or rather at what she had turned into. 

I kept replaying the moment over and over in my mind, wanting to make sense of it. Always coming up short. 

Once I managed to calm my nerves I called Macie’s dad back using her charged phone. I didn’t tear my eyes away from the doll. 

“Trisha what’s going on?” 

“You wouldn’t believe me if I told you,” I said. 

I told him that Macie had my phone and he admitted he’d already tried to call it but it just would keep ringing. 

“Is everything okay? I can swing by if you need.” 

I was staring at the doll lying on the floor, unsure if I wanted to get him mixed up in this horror. 

“Everything is fine. I’m sure Macie just turned the phone off and took the bus to work. I’ll have her text you the second she gets off,” I said. I wanted him to believe me. I knew I didn’t believe me. 

But thankfully he let it slide . “Take care okay?” Chuck said. 

I put the phone down on the counter, realizing that I was still in clothes covered with blood. 

I needed a fucking shower. 
I slid off the barstool and walked over toward the hallway, keeping the knife with me in case the doll suddenly decided to resurrect itself. 

Gingerly I stepped over it and went into the bedroom, grabbing some clothes and then carefully crossing back over to the bathroom. 

I kept my eyes on the doll at all times, briefly wondering when the police finished running the blood if it would show two different types or just my own. 

Had Sarah even bled when I stabbed her? My fractured mind couldn’t remember. I started the water and kept the curtain open, putting towels down and choosing to shower with the doll in my
periphery vision. I wasn’t about to let it out of my sight until I could get rid of it for good. 

As the water washed away the blood, I looked down at my trembling hands, praying that Macie was okay. I can’t lose her. I just can’t. 

I shivered despite the hot water. Too much had happened in a short amount of time. 

I closed my eyes letting the shower wash over me, listening to the sounds of the dripping faucet and trying to make myself feel whole again. Trying to make sense of the world again. 

It didn’t. 

A thump made my eyes bolt open and I stared at the doll again. 
Slowly, Something unseen dragged Sarah into the hidden alcove behind the wall.

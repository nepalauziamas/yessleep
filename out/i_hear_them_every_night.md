About a week ago i moved into my new home, while I was putting the couch in the livingroom i realised that there was a small crack in the wall about big enough for a mouse to squeeze in to so I didn't think about it much. (but now I realize how horrible of an idea that was)

The first night nothing much happened I only heard a few noises in the wall but only assumed it was a mouse, I was planning on calling an exterminator once i got my first pay check from my new job. I was able to sleep Easily that night.

The second night is when the really weird stuff started happening, while i was trying to sleep i heard the noise of a man crying they sounded like they were about 20 years old but I didn't think much of it since I just assumed it was one of my neighbors. I was unable to sleep until 3 am that night.

On the third night I heard a woman crying also sounding as if she was in her twenties then i decided to investigate i while walking around i saw an eye ball in the small hole in the livingroom I screamed so unbelievably loud and ran out of the house and called the police, the conversation with them went along the lines of me saying "there is a person in my walls I think" they then sent two officers to my house they tore down the walls in the livingroom to find the bodies of two people in their twenties dismembered in the walls. They were missing they're eyes however that's what makes this so much scary to me, i saw a eye in the wall and there were no eyes, i still dont know whose eyes i saw. I am assuming i saw a ghost who was trying to get my attention so they can be freed but i do not have a clue. 

I later found out later that they were the previous owners of the home. They had gone missing about a month before I bought the house, I'm currently inside an apartment complex while the decontaminate the house. I hope nothing else weird happens when i come back. If something else does happen i will be sure to update reddit about it. Hopefully they're spirits did not follow me and i can continue sleeping well and do not have any other problems with things like this happen to me. But i am extremely worried about it i have been jumping at the slightest noise i have been chilling with my dog to calm me down while i write this and he is helping me greatly while i write this. I am hoping that i can calm down and be able to move back in there safely, unfortunately no one believes me when i talk about this.

Hopefully someone here believes me and i can finally get some closure on this subject.

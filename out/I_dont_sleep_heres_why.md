I don't sleep, and here's why.

I've had problems sleeping ever since I was 6, it used to be really bad but now it's just minor things. Well until this "thing" showed up. I don't know when or where it came from but it started to bug me when I was 9 or 10.

It became worse with time. I would get these nightmares, either about me getting dragged or scratched on, then I would wake up with some kind of injury. If I was lucky, I would get about 7 hours of sleep a night.

This one time at my old house, I had a nightmare, but not like the others. In the others, I didn't see the person dragging me, in this dream they did. This is what happened: I woke up in this darkened hallway/room (I couldn't really see much) and I guess angered whoever was there because they/she jumped on me and screamed or laughed straight in my face. God her face.

She was pale, really pale, and her eyes were dark and scary. Her smile was wider than anyone's I've ever seen. Even as a 10/9 year old I knew something wasn't right about it. It just wasn't a person.

I woke up in a sweat, not just a normal sweat, not those sweats that only cover half or some of your body, no this sweat got my covers drenched in it. My neck was pouring with sweat, and so was my long hair. Then I heard it. Scratching.

I lost it when I heard long scratches underneath my bed and a figure, a tall one, in the corner of my room. I ran to my parents bedroom after I broke from my little freeze.

Now for the present time. Oh, you thought that was it? Yeah, no. This "thing" has been haunting me for my entire life. No one's going to believe me, not even my own cousin who has experienced this before with me. It's another story.

Now, I have divorced parents, and obviously I have to visit my dad on some weekends. I had visited my dad on this weekend, and they had just bought this new house next to my cousins dads house. We needed to do some cleaning and things so that we could move in.

Although I don't like my dad much, I wanted to see the house. We arrived and it was really old since no one had lived in the house for years. I got to exploring and went in the backyard to play. It was in the woods so a bunch of land was there. 

As I was playing I swear I saw something deep in the woods to the fence that marked where the actual woods was.(Woods where you couldn't go on cause yk gotta protect those animals) But, I was living in the woods, what else would I see? We shortly moved in. We had about 3 dogs (sadly died due to me going to my moms and my dad and his family not caring for them, smh) and I had to walk one of them out to go pee.

Yes, I know it's the woods and I could just let them out but the dogs loved to sprint to other houses. Anyways, as I was walking the dog way in the back (where the fence is) the dog wouldn't stop barking, and I could hear something moving behind the gate. Getting closer. Then a tall figure was in the bushes and I saw it coming to get us. I got scared to walk the dog ever since. (still had to, especially at night, my dad did this on purpose so Ig I wouldn't be scared of the dark. Still am.)

Part 2?

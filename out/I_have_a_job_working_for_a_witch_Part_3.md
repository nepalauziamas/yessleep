The last couple of days have been…rough to say the least. I left off at when I'd gotten a text from Angel. Honestly I thought it was just a shitty, half assed apology for cheating on me all those years ago. Those ones you send when you're in rehab and you're becoming 'A better person'. However to my surprise it was just 'Please help me, I don't have long' and then her address. I texted back what the hell she wanted but…I got no response. Great. I was most likely not going to have any jobs for a while so I made the dumbest decision of my life and decided to humor the text message. The address was all the way in Wyoming…why Angel would ever want to move out there I have no idea…she hated anywhere that didn't have a club near it. I didn't give it much thought and I began another long ass road trip.

Let me tell you something. Road trips while alone are awesome. There's nothin like driving down the long back roads of Alabama in a 1969 Camaro with Alice's Restaurant playing on the radio. Call me old fashioned or whatever you want, it's the absolute best. As I made my way across the country I couldn't help but wonder what was in store for me. Her message was extremely vague…maybe I was being lured down there for a joke. Little did she know that I was a little different from when we last met. As I approached my destination I noticed that I was going to nothing. I know that sounds weird but…there was literally nothing out here. It was just miles and miles and miles of woods. To my surprise I did eventually find the address. It was a small little 2 story farmhouse out in the middle of nowhere…it was kinda nice to be honest. Probably a few acres of land with it. Of course the damn thing didn't have a single light on inside though…not to mention that I didn't hear anything and when I mean anything I mean anything. Not even a cricket. 

"Well, this is it…what are you playing at, Angel…"

I grabbed my pistol and holstered it as I got out of the care. I remember how deafening it was as I my foot met the gravel of the driveway, the crunching sound, sounding like an alarm. I really can't describe how quiet it was out here and it was made all the worse by my footsteps. I almost jumped when their old wooden porch creaked as I walked up to the door and knocked…of course, no answer. I made a decision and just decided to let myself in. The door was unlocked and I stepped in to a rather nice house.

"Angel? You here?"

I called out and from up stairs I heard some rustling, like something was moving. I grabbed the pistol from my holster and made my way up the stairs…every one of those damn stairs creaked as I walked up them. Once I was up the stairs I met with five rooms along a straight hallway with 2 on the left wall, 2 on the right wall, and the final door being the end of the hallway itself. I heard the same rustling again coming from the 2nd door on the left. Being the no bullshit person I am, I walked over and decided to just kick it in. At this point I was completely over this joke or whatever the fuck was happening. When I kicked the door open I heard the most ear piercing scream…it was deafening and I'd quickly point my gun at its source…it was, Angel.

"Angel!? What the fuck is wrong with you?!"

"D-Deacon?...Oh thank God you're here…"

She went from fearing for her life to seeming to be relieved…she began to cry and ran over to hug me. Honestly I kind of just froze…I uh…don't do well with touching or being touched. It's not that I have a problem with it. It just feels weird. I guess that makes me weird…Angel would quickly back it up though…after the initial relief wore off she'd clear her throat and back away

"U-Uhm…you look good…you clearly did amazing for yourself huh…"

"Yeah, the gym can do wonders I guess. Why the fuck did you call me out here?"

Angel chuckled forcefully

"Y-You wouldn't believe me if I told you…no one did…and now I've lost everything…deek you were the only one I knew to contact…I didn't know what else to do…"

"Try me."

I said a little colder than I meant to. As much as I loved chatting with the girl that cheated on me and broke my heart I really wanted to get back home.

"T-There's this thing in the woods…deek it took Dave and Adrian…"

I remember Dave. That's the guy she cheated on me with…but I didn't know Adrian

"Who the fuck is Adrian?"

"My daughter…deek you've gotta help me…"

"And why in the fuck is that?"

"W-What?..."

"Why do I have to help you? You're not my responsibility. Hell we're not even friends. Why the hell should I care about you and Dave's bastard love child? I brought the fucker some condoms that night, not my fault he's to dumb to use them."

I started to walk out after that, I didn't have time for this, and I didn't give two shits about what Angel needed.

"It's not even his kid you asshole!"

Angel yelled at me as she followed me down the stairs

"Damn! 2 for 3, you're killing it. Or did you cheat on that poor bastard as well?"

"She's yours deek!" 

I froze…this was some kind of sick joke right…I would turn around and stare at her as she made it down the steps but right before I was about to say something the power came back on. This seemed to scare the shit out of Angel and she said in a terrified voice

"I-Its back…"

"What do you mean it's ba-"

I stopped…I looked at one of the windows in the living room and there standing just barely illuminated by the light was a girl that looked to be no older than 9 years old standing just outsiden and peering in at us. Angel saw it too and she started crying, covering her mouth so she didn't cry…the little girl looked just like me…she even inherited my heterochromatic eyes. 

"You fucking lied to me!" 

I yelled angrily at Angel, turning to her

"Who in the fuck do you think you are!? You let me think I didn't have a kid for 9 years!?"

Angel turned to me with a fearful expression…she was probably confused at why I wasn't flipping out that there was a little girl staring at us outside

"T-That's what you're concerned about right now?!"

"YES!"

Whatever was outside would smile at us and would knock on the window

"Help me daddy…or else I might B̷̢̺̎̾U̷̝͕͑̋͜͝R̷̢̺̙͂̀Ņ̸͕̩̉̊ ̴̟͝İ̶̝̯̠̔͌Ń̵͔̟͓̑ ̷̠͈͍͋̽̓Ḩ̶̾̊̍E̵̦̫͛ͅL̶̛̖̠̳͋L̶̯̥̈́̕"

This sent Angel back into a fit of crying and made me turn back to the creature just as the power went off again. The next few hours were spent by me trying to console Angel and trying to figure out what we were exactly dealing with…I got all of my gear from the car and got set up inside. I'm currently sitting with Angel upstairs and she's telling me stories about Adrian. I'm trying to act like I don't give a shit but…honestly she sees right through me. I'm gonna get off my phone and start listening. I'll update as soon as I can and sorry this post was so short.

I wish I knew sooner. Everything was great until I found something that would change my life.

 My mother and Father decided to send me and my sister to my uncles house. My uncle was hesitant in the beginning but he soon agreed to let us stay.
  
 Me and my sister had to stay with my uncle for the summer because my parents had big business trips during the summer so they did not want me and my sister staying in the house alone. It told us about 7 hours to get to my uncles house. My uncle never really talks to his family he isolate himself from everyone. 
 
When we got there he gave us very strict rules like don’t go down into the basement, his room, or the garage without him knowing. Most of the time my uncle was gone but he would get home he would tell my sister and me to go play outside until he told us to come back.
 
I never really question why he wants us outside when he comes home. One day we was gone and I was close to the basement when I smelt something that me had me gagging. I wanted to look but I was the scared. Weeks past and the smell got worst. I got the courage to go down so I went.

And what I found had me sick to my stomach. I had found a girl gagged and tied up. She was very dirty and scared looking. I heard my uncle come home and I run up from the basement had fast has I can before he caught me. The next day I decided to go back so I did. I wanted to let the girl go but I did want to end up like her if he found out. So I had a plan that in the night I was going to run away with the girl and my sister. It took me a week to finally go through with the plan. When I went down I saw her looking at a box so I went to check it out and I was horrified to see cut of body parts and it was all bloody.
 
I wanted to scream but I couldn’t. The smell of the dead body parts made me sick. Then something clicked my uncle was kill theses people that’s why he didn’t want us at his house.

I couldn’t let the girl out. I ran without the girl and just took my sister. I ran to the closes neighbor. It was 11:30 pm so they probably won’t answer. But they answers and I was crying telling them to call 911. The guy was confused so I had to tell has fast has I could. The police came…

They never found him or the girl at the house. He left before the police could get him. He somewhere out there wanted. Some days I think my uncle is looking for me for payback for ratting him out.

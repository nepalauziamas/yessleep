  

OK so guys i got a bit of an update first and foremost the radio came to life at about 11 pm. Yesterday it buzzed to life making me both excited and uneasy. “Are the batteries in” It seemed a little demanding Once I responded with a “yes” she seemed less wound up and a little more calm with a simple “good” we began our conversation with mostly me prying for answers. Im going to save both of us our time by not bothering transcribing as most of it was back and forths of “I don’t know” and “why don’t you know” Basically, she refused to give her name and couldn’t really describe the creatures as when she was discovered it was only a small operation. 

whether its military or private she does not know what she does know is they are very powerful. Oh yes shes been taken she doesn’t know where I don’t know where, all we collectively know is she’s still there hiding surviving off of stolen food and water when she gets the chance to enter the kitchen. As for her reason for being there She said she can communicate and interact with all things electric, hence the radio. And the reason I need batterys in the radio is the organisation can track abnormal activity but if I have a functioning radio with batterys it just acts as a normal radio only the outgoing pulses can be tracked and this high tech company is way to protective to allow any siganls leaving there to be trackable so ya aslong as the radio is powered on im in the clear.

 Oh and on a personal note I got fired. Apparently keeping a radio for 4 days is considered “”stealing company property”” ya that’s about it, its kinda annoying that I have to now find a new job while being hunted by a super secret and dangerous organisation with hell hounds but hey atleast my headaches haven’t acted up in a while. Shes continued contacting me on a 3-4 hour basis which has concerned my family and friend why I keep a radio on my person at all times but orders are orders. Our last call was a tad concerning though  luckily I got in the habbit of transcribing our events after second call so it kinda went as follows. 

Radio: hey you there?

Me: ya im about to go hand out CVs

Radio: sorry again I got you sacked.

Me: sacked? I haven’t heard that outside movies. 

Radio: oh so whats it called when you get sacked so

Me: fired just fired

Radio: oh sorry I got you fired 

Me: no biggy, how are you so? any update on your location?

Radio: oh ya about that I em kinda got a little bit lost here and well I may or may not have put the facility on full alert. 

Me: not good?

Radio: Ya not good. they made some small puppy hounds that are in the vents at the moment. 

Me: have you seen one yet

Radio: nah, not yet they cant find me im to fast.

Me: oh good 

Radio: ya basically lived here for a year now im always two steps…… oh shit 

Me: what hey are you okay

Radio: oh shit SHIT SHIT SHIIIIIIIIT

And that was that. Im sure shes fine, well she kinda has to be its not like she can realy be caught shes a master at sneaking as she put it. Still I hope shes okay I kinda started enjoying our talks. 

Okay so I was waiting to get an update from her but I had these weird dreams and I was in a vent system and well I don’t know how else to put it but I think I was her or atleast watching from her pov. She/I was crawling through a metal airvent the cold metal was burning up my knees from friction like going down a slide in shorts I could barely here the set of thuds behind me over my breath but once I had the sound locked in I noticed they were gaining and gaining and gaining until they were right behind me the warm decaying breath all to familiar I turned left into a new shaft and then right but no matter how hard I tried I just wasn’t fast enough my lungs began to hurt,

 my side in stitches and my knees bleeding I could here yelling from underneath followed by a POP and the distinct sound of metal breaking metal small holes formed all around me leaking light into the otherwise black vents. The creature was reaching for me hearing its teeth chomp near my ankles and a straw like fur rubbing against my exposed skin where it was barely missing me.

 I knew my luck was running low in a final attempt I turned to kick at it but missed it was hidden in the dark like the fucking coward it was I was kicking blind until i felt my ankle get crushed its teeth cutting into me like a butchers knife feeling my flesh get severed the open air pearsing inside the wound finaly with a tug equivalent in strength to a semi truck I was dragged through the dark.

 When I woke up my leg was covered in blood but there was no wound. I genuinely believe I was in her head. The fear she felt I can still feel it I can’t calm down and my face feels warm and my heart hurts My mind is all confumbled and I feel distant from my current reality like somethings fogging up my mind like a hard morning after a night out on the town. Luckily I don’t have a job to call in sick for.

 My radios been completely silent I even tried calling out against my better judgment and her recommendations. Im currently using a library laptop in fear of being tracked though I have noticed a lot more weird stares perhaps im a little paranoid I don’t know, if you know of any orginisation like this please contact me I.

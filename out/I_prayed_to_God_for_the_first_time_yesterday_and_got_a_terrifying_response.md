I've been in a rough place lately. Last month I had to bury my older sister, Kennedy, after she'd lost her battle to brain cancer. I also quit my warehouse job a couple weeks ago as the daily verbal abuse was becoming too much to bear. Now, as a 24 year-old man living by himself in an apartment, the clock can only tick so much before the next rent cycle comes around. Kennedy's funeral wasn't cheap, and neither is my ongoing therapy. Stack inflation and the heavy cost of living in Vancouver on top of that, and you've got a recipe for anxiety and unending worry. So, whether it was just placebo or if it actually worked, I decided to try praying for the first time ever last night. But the response I got shook me to my core.

I've never been a particularly spiritual guy. Both my parents were Presbyterian Christians, but they weren't the devout type that were at every Sunday Service. They also didn't force Kennedy and I to read scriptures or pray with them. However, Kennedy always joined them without hesitation. Ever since I could remember, she was recounting all sorts of Biblical tales and parables to me. I never really took them to heart, but I always found the details fascinating. My favorite was when she'd tell me the story of Noah's Ark because I was really into animals growing up.

Fast forward to a year ago, and Kennedy's faith was as strong as ever. She was doing really well in her career and had started a beautiful family of her own before her diagnosis. We hung out every so often and detailed what had been going on in our individual lives. She was always incredibly rational and approached problems logically rather than purely out of faith. However, when we both were unable to solve a problem either of us had, she always said a word of prayer.

Now, I didn't really believe in prayer so I just kind of closed my eyes and waited for her to finish. I figured it was best that way anyhow, since I personally wouldn't want to feign religious faith just for the sake of it. However, her praying with me did help me feel a bit calmer and less stressed. Whether that's placebo or not, I don't know, but last night I decided to give it a try myself. After all, I had put in dozens of job applications over the past couple weeks and haven't heard back from any of them. I felt almost compelled to reach out to a higher power at this point.

I sat down on my bed, put my hands together, and started praying.

"Dear Heavenly Father,

I reach out to you today from a place of unease and worry. I don't know where else to turn. It seems like my life is crumbling apart. I've already lost my loving sister; rest her soul. Bills are stacking up fast. Meals are becoming smaller and less frequent in my attempt to save money. I know I haven't come to you before, and I know that asking for your help may even be audacious of me. But, if you can extend any signal that you are here and watching over me, please reveal it to me. Please let me know that there is some light at the end of the tunnel. A little glimmer of hope is all I need to push through right now. Thank you, and may you watch over me as I know you are watching over Kennedy.

Amen."

With that short prayer, I got into bed and scrolled through Instagram aimlessly until my eyes grew heavy. About half an hour later I was asleep.

I began dreaming heavily. I was inside my bedroom, and I was laying in the same position that I had gone to bed in. The moon was shining in through my bedroom window, dimly illuminating the rest of the room. I took a moment to look around, before staring up at the ceiling for what seemed like eternity. This was pretty boring compared to the usual scenarios that played out; I wasn't running haphazardly from some unseen force or drifting uncontrollably through the void of space.

The mundane nature of the dream quickly changed when a sudden flash of light enveloped the entire bedroom. I was now stuck in a world where there was nothing but white. I was standing upright, looking into a vast nothingness. I turned around and tried to notice anything that stood out against the blank backdrop. I began navigating aimlessly for what seemed like hours. I ran, jump, hopped, and flailed around, before finally growing tired and just sitting down on the blank ground beneath me. 

Suddenly, I saw a blue object off in the distance.

I stood back up and focused on it. It was almost too small to perceive, but by this time I had gotten so used to pure white that a speck of dust would've stood out to me. The object got larger and larger as it drew closer. I realized that what I was observing was a small blue flame floating towards me. I watched in awe. It was as if this flame was entrancing me.

It finally stopped at what I perceived to be a few feet in front of me. It began to speak in a pleasant, soft voice in the tone of what I would describe as a young woman.

"It was you who reached out to God earlier, wasn't it?" it said slowly and calmly.

I was shocked at this seemingly sentient blue flame that was talking to me. "Y-yes, I stammered. Who might you be?" I asked nervously.

"I am one of His angels," the voice replied with a reverberating echo. "I came to you because your spirit is writhing in worry," the flame continued. "I have descended unto you to be the signal you so fervently requested of The Lord a few hours ago."

Even if it was part of a dream, this felt extremely surreal. Usually, whatever conversations that went on in my dreams were short, vague, and nonsensical when I experienced them. But this angel spoke with astounding clarity, making the moment extremely vivid.

"C-can you help me? Is God able to help me? Is there any hope that I can get out of this predicament that I'm in?" It seemed like forever before the flame began to emanate an echo, beginning its response to my question.

"No."

I was shocked. What kind of answer was that? All across the board, there was no hope? And no elaboration whatsoever? I began to shake as if I had drank too much coffee in one sitting.

"What do you mean? Has He no pity for me? Is it because I'm not a Christian?" I asked hastily.

"Young one, you need not be a Christian for The Lord to answer your prayers."

I was confused now. "So, what's the problem? There has to be some reason why I'm not being acknowledged by Him. And why does He need someone else to respond to my prayer?" I was beginning to regain my composure as I engaged in further conversation with this angel.

"You are not acknowledged by God because *nobody* is acknowledged by God. The Lord abandoned humanity thousands of years ago," The voice said as calm as can be.

I couldn't believe what I was hearing. My anxiety began to creep up on me again. Where would Kennedy be if God abandoned his post? "But--"

"Humans were a species designed in God's likeness," The voice interjected. "He considered them to be his crowning achievement. When He put Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, He would watch them with joy day after day as they carried out their lives. However, contrary to what the Bible says, it was not a snake or a devil or any other malevolent force that caused them to eat the Forbidden Fruit."

This piqued my interest. "What made them do it then?"

"God created humans in His own likeness, and as such granted them the same free will that He had since the moment they came into existence. The problem is, God is not an infallible, omnipotent being as you humans believe Him to be."

The voice grew softer in its projection.

"Sometimes, things went wrong. Single-celled organisms were His first attempt at creating a sentient life form. But their forms and functions were way off from what He had envisioned. He repeated His creation experiments for billions of years, creating life form after life form after life form. He got close to what He wanted when He formed primates, but even they did not meet His standards. When God finally created Adam and Eve, He thought He had finally done it."

My mind was boggled at this point. I kept listening with uneasy interest.

"The Lord oversaw His greatest achievements as they wandered around the Garden of Eden, which He had generated especially for them. Adam and Eve had bore several children, and were carefree beings filled with happiness and joy. The Garden was a huge expanse of lush, green forests and crystal clear waters. It was a paradise on Earth that served as a home for the frolicking humans. However, one day, Adam and Eve stumbled upon a tree that bore a singular apple from one of its branches."

"This is where the snake descended and tricked Eve into eating the apple, right?" I asked.

"No," the voice corrected me. "The two of them laid eyes on the lone apple at the exact same time, and immediately sought to satiate their hunger with this fruit. It was at this point that a fatal flaw in God's development of humans made itself apparent." The voice paused.

"Greed overcame both Adam and Eve. Greed was an emotion that God did not anticipate to be a product of the humans' free will. When God witnessed His perfect creatures clawing each other to death over the apple, He realized that the free will that had caused them to maul each other was the same free will that He possessed Himself. Realizing that He was just as prone to sin as His supposedly perfect creations, The Lord went insane."

I couldn't believe what I was hearing. "God went *insane*?" A feeling of dread overwhelmed me as I awaited the angel's next response.

"Yes. The Lord shamefully retreated into obscurity and left us angels wandering the universe, tormented by the fruitless prayers of Adam and Eve's descendants. Each and every one of you humans is descended from that ill-fated couple, and the evils of the world are spontaneously committed as a result of your flawed free will. None of us angels have the slightest clue where God went, or where He is at this moment. All we can do is listen to and address the cries of His "perfect" beings, who are more hopeless now than ever before."

I didn't know how to process what I was hearing, let alone respond. If all this was true, then money was the least of my problems. "Where is my sister? Where is Kennedy?" I asked hastily.

"That depends," the disembodied voice replied as the flame flickered.

"It *depends*? On what?!" I was growing impatient.

"On whether an angel helped to escort her soul into the ethereal realm upon death. As I said, we angels were left without direction once The Lord abandoned us. The true among us try our best, but we are not omnipotent. We cannot have a hand in every human event; be it death, prayer, baptism, or anything else. Our numbers have waned and our divine will has wilted in the absence of God. Angels now occupy one of an infinite number of points on the spectrum of morality, just as humans do. Some stay true to their original missive instilled by The Lord. However, some prefer to do nothing and drift endlessly. Others have decided to dedicate themselves to nefarious activities in the absence of God's authority."

The blue flame dimmed and the emanating voice grew somber. "Have you seen your sister's apparition after she passed?"

"No. I don't believe in such things." I answered.

"It doesn't matter what you believe. Apparitions are real and they exist. Contrary to what humans think, these beings are not evil or lost. They are merely the intermediate product of a human soul transitioning into the ethereal realm. Angels guide them as they complete this process. Once the apparition stage is complete, the soul melts away and ceases to be. No afterlife, no Heaven or Hell. Just unthinking, unfeeling eternity. If you haven't seen your sister's apparition at least once following her passing, it means she never transitioned."

"So WHERE is she then? I'm tired of your rambling! Are you not supposed to bring me comfort and peace?" I yelled with tears forming in my eyes.

"No. Quite the opposite, actually." The white nothingness around me went completely dark. The blue flame extinguished itself as I heard distant, guttural laughter coming from the darkness I was now in. 

I frantically look around and yell out, trying to locate this angel that I thought was going to help me. 

"You see, I'm one of those angels that happens to be quite fond of tormenting you humans," a distant voice from my left announced. 

The voice relocated to my right. "In fact, when I saw your sister hanging on to the last threads of her life, I was the first angel to lay claim to her spirit."

I turned around with my fists balled up as the voice now tried to flank me from behind. "I happen to know exactly where your sister is, and how she's doing. Do you want to see her?" The voice tormented me. 

"SHOW YOURSELF! I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU ARE, I'LL KILL YOU IF YOU LAY HANDS ON HER!" I was screaming at the top of my lungs with pure anger coursing through me. 

There was nothing but silence now. I stood still in the dark, waiting for the slightest indication that the angel was still here. My head grew numb and tinnitus rang in my ears as I focused on the unfathomably silent surroundings. 

The ringing stopped when I heard my sister's voice in the distance.

"H-help... me..."

I turned around to see Kennedy emerge from the darkness on all fours. She was naked and her head was forcefully rotated upside down. Her limbs were unnaturally long and her breathing was raspy and loud. The stench that filled the air was unbearable. Kennedy, or what was left of her, was looking around the endless darkness with rapid twitches of the neck and head, before facing directly towards me.

In the split second that I had locked eyes with her, a grin formed on her inverted face. Yellow, broken teeth made themselves fully apparent as her pupils shrunk with excitement. Kennedy lifted both her right arm and right leg in tandem, reaching forward before doing the same coordinated movement with her left arm and leg. She began crawling towards me on all fours at a gradually faster speed, her hands and feet making a sickening crunching sound with each step. She stopped right in front of me and stood up on her legs, her face mere inches away from mine. She looked me in the eyes. 

"I can't wait to see you again, brother."

I woke up in a cold sweat. My heart was beating faster than I had ever felt it beat before. I was gasping for air, panning around the bedroom for danger. Nothing. I lay awake, flinching at the slightest sound of the house settling or of animals rustling outside. I just closed my eyes, waiting in terror as my consciousness slowly drifted away back into sleep. 

Before I could fully knock out, though, I heard the bedroom door creak open. "I've finally found you!" Kennedy said, before the sickening crunching of her limbs returned. She got into my bed and I didn't hear a peep for the rest of the night. 

While fully coming to terms with all this has been tough, I still love my sister to death. I'll never abandon her, nor will she ever abandon me.

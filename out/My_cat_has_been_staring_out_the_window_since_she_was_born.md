I’ve always wanted  a pet growing up. So when my mom came home with a cat for my birthday I was more than excited. I was thinking about those stereotypical movie of how the pet is inseparable from the owners like Marley and me or something like that. For the 1st month she was great and happy like a normal cat. 

One day she noticed out the window the birds in the backyard. This was nothing special to me or my family but she loved them. Or I think I don’t know… she would stare at them like a deer in headlights. All day and all night. Occasionally she would go and eat and use the litter box but eventually she got to skinny because she would keep out the window. I talked to my parents about it, they say they don’t know a difference from when they brought her home.

I’m scared now I don’t know why they think this is normal…. The birds are just birds as far as I know. 

My parents and Infact many people have been acting weird lately like a ummm what’s the word NPC like in a video game. Like I ask them or tell them something then they tell me an unrelated response. Today I asked my mom what she was doing because she was scratching her head like she had lice or something.

She told me in a weird awkward voice “can’t wait for that coming can’t we.”

She gave me this smile that I can’t get out of my head. Stuff like this has been happening for weeks everyone and everyone I see has been scratching their head. Not like the thinking way like the way you do when you have lice and you want to scratch it crazy.

Today a man in sunglasses came to the door he was looking really sharp. Like funeral sharp. Very black suit black slick back hair. He had an ear peace in but I saw him take it out when I opened the door. He handed me a note that said:

“be quiet don’t talk to anyone, I will explain, come with me. I know what you’ve been seeing, the world is not normal right now. Your not crazy, this is not a dream, follow me and don’t look like anything is out of place. 


I followed him. He brought me to his car. A black Chevrolet Suburban with tinted windows. He opened the door for me to the back and I got in. He got in the driver seat and he looked in the mirror gave me a smile. 

He began: 

“So kid, you like horror movies, sci-fi all that fancy stuff right?”

“Yea I guess” I said with hesitation

“Well maybe this will help better understand what I’m about to say, you know those secret ang envy type stuff like that in movies where they do experiments with other types of worlds, well those are not all fiction. About a little more than a year ago we developed a test that succeeded in making. A world just like ours, that mirrors physically everything that is here, we were looking to create this kind of society to test different nuclear weapons on a real world scenario, well this world like ours has people, ones that look exactly like all of us. We took a couple of people to test on to see how accurate these people are to ours. During the testing we figured out this race, these things are so much more aggressive than normal humans, when disturbed they go into a state like human-monster hybrid. Their eyes will start to bleed and their hair will fall out. Their skin will turn into a scaly spider-like texture. They then attack. Now there was a breach from this world a couple weeks ago. They replaced many people. Maybe everyone. With themselves. They look the exact same as us but they are not. Now me and u aren’t affected because during the breach the military was able to kill the anti grafa as we like to call them that look like us. They then took over. The military tried to hide it so they didn’t send any distress calls.”


I didn’t say anything. I looked out the window and noticed everyone who looked so proper in the their daily lives I finally spoke up and said “why should I believe this?” 

“Well kid how would you explain the behaviour around you.”

“Well now what?” I said still in disbelief and shock 

“I don’t really know this might be the end for all of us but no matter what for now, don’t talk to anyone.”

As he said this a person was crossing the road, the man didn’t see as he was looking at me. He hit him. We both paused breathless, the what seemed to be a normal person but wasn’t was laying their for 5 seconds, all the other probably antigrafas heads cracked straight to look at what happened. Then all of a sudden start seizing and shaking , it ripped out it’s hair with it bare hands, bleeding out the mouth. It’s skin changing Almost like melting, tentacles coming from inside it’s body ripping it apart. The true form was revealed, as this happened everybody else surrounding the car did the same.

“Oh, F*ck” whispered the man with tremble in his voice.

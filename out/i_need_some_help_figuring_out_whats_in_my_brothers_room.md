here's some backstory, I don't know if it will be useful or not but do with it what you will.

almost a year ago I moved up to my sister's old room in the upstairs portion of our house. but as of recently, my parents and I have been planning on moving me to my brother's old room straight across from hers because it has more space and my sister's room runs a bit small.  since I was moving into his room I had to pack up some stuff and move it in there to start the process, however recently I had to take everything out of there and move it back to my room since he was coming home and had to make sure I didn't leave anything in there. I was initially fine with moving into his room but now I'm conflicted.

now that you have some backstory, here's what happened.

&#x200B;

this Monday I was brought to an event that's kind of Christian in a sense, while the organization believes in god and incorporates him in some rituals/lessons they aren't necessarily Christians. Anyways, I was there because I was being initiated into the organization and everything was going fine. the whole thing went smoothly, and it wasn't until we came home that I experienced this. 

&#x200B;

when we were home I realized that I had forgotten something in my brother's old room, so I went to go get it out real quick. and since the door is really hard to open I had to quite literally ram into it just to get in, when I finally busted the door open I was salty bc I was tired and grumpy at the door for being so stubborn. so much so that I didn't give a single fuck about the overlapping female voices I heard from the closet as I went to get the stuff.

I only freaked out when I got back to my room bc what I originally thought was someone playing their music too loud while driving wasn't actually that at all. I know this because the windows were closed and as I said earlier I heard this from the general direction to the right of me in the closet. the voices sounded female and they were very loud, some voices were normal, and some were whispering. however, I couldn't decipher what they were saying at all as they were overlapping. the only reason I can think of why there might be an entity in the room is that I remember my older sister said that and her friend messed around with a ouija board upstairs when she used to live with us and apparently pissed something off/ annoyed it.

I recently told my friend who practices witchcraft and knows about the paranormal and he suggest that it might be nightwalkers or a poltergeist that brought friends over, but I wanted to see if anyone has some other ideas to help us figure out what this is?

12.15 AM Hello, my name is Dizo. My mother is currently in the hospital and I needed to find a hotel to stay in, I dont have too much money so I couldnt afford anything great but I think I found a solid hotel. Anderson Hotel seems to have some great reviews and its only 70 bucks a night. I am currently in in the car that they sent me, the driver is not speaking and wearing an odd outfit. I will keep you posted.

12.45 AM (I woke up in a strange room that seems to be the reception desk of a old hotel until I heard) "Hello, I am the Guiding Light, I do not know how you have stumbled upon this abandoned hotel, Anderson hotel has been closed since 1994." (I looked behind me realising that the door behind you has been shut, when you try to tug it open you get launched back to where I woke up then I heard the Guiding Light again) "I see you have realised there is no escape... You must complete all 100 doors and reach the elevator, I will meet you there. For now you should go to the reception desk and ring the bell 2 times then clap once. If you hear a whisper from behind you immediately close your eyes then repeat the process without opening your eyes. If you hear a tap from on your shoulder then you can open your eyes, if you don’t then repeat the process until you feel the tap on your shoulder. If you do turn around and DO NOT LOOK AT ME. I will put a paper on the desk then disappear. Once you hear a *poof* then read the piece of paper. (I did all of the steps correctly though I felt a little weird after the Guiding Light disappears.) 

1:00 AM I saw a couple of rules on the paper. Then I decided that the rules arnt very important and that I should keep looking forward. That was my mistake. Then I see a key on the desk when I took it it felt supernaturally heavy even though it was the size of an average key. Then I looked around the room, I saw a door with a lock on it so I put two and two together and put the key in the keyhole, surprisingly it opens without me having to turn it. As soon as I walk in the doorway the lights started to flicker rapidly then I hear something ungodly. Some anomaly, some creature that does not belong to this world I didn’t know what to do. Then I heard it approach me. I was close to a wardrobe that I could easily hide in, or i could make a run for it. This thing seemed fast and I didnt think I could outrun it so I decided to hide in the wardrobe. Im hiding in the wardrobe right now. I have no signal yet for some reason I can post this. I will try my best to stay alive until help arrives. But I any more of theese monsters appear I might not be able to.

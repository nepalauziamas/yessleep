 

I think I’m going crazy, every second it gets harder to think. My ears are picking up sounds I shouldn’t be able to hear, and my eyes just can’t adjust to the light anymore. I can hear them whispering into my ear, telling me horrible stuff. It's getting closer, I can, I can feel it.  But I’m getting ahead of myself, I’m just so confused. It all started a few months ago.

I was walking to school and running late like always, as I was about to enter the school, I heard a high pitched sound. I remember that in those months the sound became more frequent so I didn’t really pay attention to it anymore. Then it would last that long so I didn’t bother to go and see a doctor. Wait, what was I talking about? Oh, yes I was running late. So when I came into class I believed the teacher said something like: “Guess who decided to show up today.’ As you can imagine I was a little embarrassed about that, I’m not really a social guy. I was that kind of kid always in the back who froze when asked to answer a question. It’s funny how fast things can change, but that’s not my point. It was somewhere in those days that things started changing, drastically. After a bike incident people weren’t the same. They were not really there if you get what I mean, or maybe it was just my head messing with me. Anyway after the accident I woke up in the hospital, concussion. Of course my parents were concerned and I had to promise them I was fine before I could even leave the house. And in a way I was fine until it all started mixing together, the days blurred from one to another and I couldn’t keep track of it and always that high pitched sound. It was everywhere. 

It took a week or two for it to appear, I didn’t see it, but I could feel it, a burden like someone hanging around your legs always there. For days I could barely sleep and I would always look behind me outdoors but also in the house I didn’t feel safe. I was so busy with it that I didn’t notice the people around me changing. It happened very slowly though, but I had just paid more attention so I wouldn't be in this mess. I should have seen the signs, the eyes is one of the things that changes first and then, it’s too much to even think about it.

I I can’t now, it’s too hard. Please make it stop, too loud. Help me! I have to go for now. I just can’t go on like this. I will be back with more information once my head is ready to process and to function. achh I just hurt so much, for now I’m gonna give you one life saving tip: don't be ignorant about the world around you. If you see them change, please warn me. I think I found a way if only I could get my head to work aga….

My street is not particularly remarkable. A short row of tiny houses with gardens that are longer than they are wide. Our house in particular is very old. I’ve lived here since I was about 10 years old, and even from that age I can remember creepy shit happening all around our home. Things not being where we left them, cupboard doors flying open, and our family dog barking at seemingly nothing. Me and my mom have always been incredibly superstitious, and we always joked that there was a friendly ghost like Casper who would just enjoy messing with us. 

I'm starting to think our jokes may have angered this "ghost".

I’ve been home alone much more often recently, and I had no complaints about it up until now. My usual morning routine consists of going downstairs, filling up my water bottle and chilling downstairs with the dog after doing my chores until one of my parents gets home from work, or my sister returns home from school. 

Well, I woke up on a welcomed cloudy day after many days of unbearable heat that gave me migraines beyond belief. I pulled myself out of bed, and grabbed my empty water bottle and made my way downstairs. The kitchen faces directly into our garden, which is connected to every other garden on our street. Behind the gardens is a small path, which is usually where the younger kids play during the warmer months. 

I woke up earlier than usual this morning, so my parents and sister had only very recently left for work and school and the street was empty of children due to the clouds. As I approached the sink, something caught my eye.   
A woman, simply peering at me over the 6ft tall gate which was built into our fence that blocked off the path behind the garden. She was pretty much your regular small-town citizen, if a little more unruly and pale. Her thin Grey hair was all over the place, but to be honest, that wasn’t what made me a little unnerved looking at her. It was her eyes. I didn’t bring my glasses down with me, as I can usually cope just fine without them in the morning, so I wasn’t sure if my eyes were just playing tricks on me.

But the look in her eyes was unmistakable. The iris and pupils were shrunken to smaller than what seemed humanly possible, and the whites of her eyes also were seemingly larger than what should be possible. Her entire head was turned to look directly at me through the kitchen window, and her pale hands clung tightly to the top of the fence. Due to the height of the fence, I couldn’t see the rest of her expression, but she did not seem happy from what I could already see.

I didn’t realize that I was frozen in place for what I’d say was about 5 minutes - my neighbor heading to his car snapped me out of the fear that locked me in place. I watched as he hugged his child, and kissed his wife goodbye, and pushed open the gate to start the walk to his car. As he got to just outside my house he smiled and waved - I quickly waved back to make sure he didn’t think I was a bit odd for staring at him during his own morning routine. However, I wasn’t the only one staring.   
As he walked at a pretty brisk pace down the street, my eyes drifted to the woman at my fence. She was now staring dead at my neighbor, her head following him long after he disappeared out of my view. Once he’d walked far enough to apparently get out of her view, her head snapped at a scary speed to face me once again. I locked eyes with her, as many thoughts raced through my head.

While I stood there, I realized - my neighbor had paid the woman absolutely no attention, as if he hadn’t even seen her. That caused me to laugh, and shake my head at myself. I was clearly just exhausted from the migraines that the heat had given me, and it had gotten to the point where I was even hallucinating ghosts on my street. I filled up my water bottle as I had initially intended, and also grabbed a few painkillers on my way to our front room. 

I could’ve sworn I heard the gate open as soon as I turned my back - but I shrugged and assumed it was my neighbor on the other side heading off to her car too.

Not even 5 minutes had passed before I began to feel uneasy. The kind of unease you feel when you randomly wake up at 3am and don’t have the balls to look around your room or turn the light on. My dog was occupied staring out onto the road by the front room, which my neighbor had just driven down as he was now well on his way to work, so he wasn’t barking to alert me of anything. I tried to brush it off as the painkillers just working overtime because I still felt the pain in my head, but it eventually got too much for me.

I wandered back into the kitchen, feeling as if my feet were dragging the rest of my body unwillingly. I was focused on one thing - looking out of the window. Reaching the sink, I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. Once I opened them, my eyes immediately fell on the gate.

She was gone.

Again, I had to have a little laugh at myself. Clearly my head was still funny, and the medication had now started to work! I mean, if she was really there, surely my neighbor would’ve tried to-

She was looking through the door.

The door is built quite weirdly. I believe it’s called a “dutch door”, it has a window on the top half which is usually covered with a blind we installed - but not today for whatever reason. 

And she was there. Face pressed hard against the window and looking directly into our house, directly at me. No condensation formed around her nostrils or mouth from her breathing, just face squished against the glass as her eyes followed me stumbling back onto one of the dinner table chairs. 

My eyes did not leave hers. I clumsily fumbled for my phone, bringing it up to my eye level so I could watch both the woman and just barely read my phone properly. Opening my messages, I clicked on the contact that I assumed was my sister.

**Wt tme u hme 2day???**

*im in math rn lol*

I sighed. Of course she couldn’t answer the question properly.

**Dnt cm thru bck dr cm tru front**

**Tll mom n dad sme thng i cnt rghtnw pls p**

*why are u talking like that just text normally*

*but ok* 

My eyes were constantly flicking back and forth between my phone and the woman, and I began to realize, hers were too. 

I’m not sure why I didn’t phone the police. I was close, but something prevented me from fully ringing up. What would I even say? A woman was watching me? Yeah, they’ll definitely send a police car out for that, I thought.

Instead, I sat there for an agonizingly long time. I tried not to check the time too often. My parents got home at about 4 in the afternoon depending on the traffic, and my sister was at a party so wouldn’t be home until very late that night. At around 3.30, my phone pinged, so I bought it back up to eye level. It was my mom messaging me.

*Hey, we’re gonna get a takeout after work. Thinking McDonald's. Will be abit busy so we might be late home. Anything u want in particular?*

My phone died immediately after I got that message. My heart sank. I wouldn’t know how much time was going to pass until my parents got home. I think I forgot to blink for a very long period of time. I was counting the time by trying to count the seconds - I tried tapping the table, counting with Mississippi in between each number, blinking in seconds to at least keep blinking normally, yet I almost never remained in focus. But I never once took my eyes off the woman.

When the clock reached about 4.30 (I’d have guessed), she simply turned around and walked off. 

Nothing extreme happened. She blinked back at me one time, then pulled away from the window, walked down the garden and out onto the street. I sat there in utter disbelief. Almost 10 and a half hours of suffering, and that was it. I hesitantly rubbed my eyes, and finally relaxed myself. Not even moments after, my parents walked through the gate with huge smiles. I couldn’t help but smile at myself.

This was all yesterday. Up until this very hour I’ve convinced myself I was just having some kind of painkiller/migraine/heatstroke induced fever dream and I will never have to encounter the actual embodiment of the ghost me and my mom used to joke about all the time, and it will continue to just be a tiny nuisance in the house.

Until I woke up in a cold sweat, about half an hour ago, to the sound of the gate creaking open in the dead of night.

6am

Tuesday.

I open the window to let the early morning breeze cycle out the stagnant hot air that I've been breathing all night. Let the dog out into the backyard, it's gone business to attend to.

Pick out an outfit for the day, a navy short sleeve button down and black jeans, casual but not against office dress code.

Cold shower in the dark, dress, brush, spritz on some cheap cologne. Decide to skip on breakfast today, maybe go for an early lunch with Jamie and Constance to that sushi spot they're always sneaking off to. 

I put on a pot to brew, let the dog back in, start the eternal game of where's my wallet and keys.

Charlie's almost out of kibble, will need to pick up more on the way back. I mix in a few scraps of cold cuts into his bowl to fill in the void. He doesn't complain. 

Check on coffee, hasn't even begun to heat up. Not even on. 

Dammit.

Another mental note added to the list of things needing fixing around here. 

Won't get to it until Saturday unfortunately. Schedule is over-booked as per usual. I can't seem to just say no. 

"See you later buddy, try not to piss on everything."

I go out the side entrance instead of the front door, otherwise old Mrs Matthews will see me and I'll be late again. Can't afford that. She'll have to settle for talking to the birds and squirrels today. What she's doing up at this hour and at her age I'll never know, nor care to find out.

About half a block out and I breathe a sigh of relief, she's no where to be seen. I feel like today's gonna turn out to be a smooth ride, even with the lack of caffeine in me.

Another half block, then down 200th, and there it is, right on time for once. I give my best effort at a sprint and clambour aboard, a little winded, but the cardio sessions have helped immensely. 

I drop eleven quarters into the fare box, reveling in the audible feedback of the coins clanking down the chute. 
You can keep your shitty fare cards, Metropolitan Transportation Authority. We all know it's a sham. 

I mumble a meaningless greeting to the plexiglass and shamble down towards the rear of the bus. I like sitting in the very back row.

There's something ethereal about viewing the world around you from an elevated perspective. Almost like a movie playing, but there's no plot. No protagonist. No ending. 

Just life in motion, directing the actors along with marketing techniques and social conformity. Buy this, eat that, talk to these people, look at this silly cat playing piano.

It's both satisfying and sickening.

Wait a second.

Something feels off. I take a break from my spacing out.

We haven't moved and it's been well over two minutes.

There's no cars in front blocking the lane, nor do I see anyone outside running to the bus. 

No.

No...no...no...no.

That's not it.

Hard to breath, should probably open the window to let the early morning breeze cycle out the...

God I need coffee.

What time is it?

I get up and make my way back to the front to voice my frustrations at the driver.

Knock and on the plexiglass, shout at it, no response.

The bus still hasn't moved.

Neither have the bodies.

They never do.

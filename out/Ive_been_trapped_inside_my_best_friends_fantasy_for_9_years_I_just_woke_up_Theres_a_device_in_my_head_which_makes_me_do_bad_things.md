I used to wish for a time machine.

To go back to my twelve-year-old self and be nicer to Emmaline Odair—to be a real friend to her. 

But as I slowly began to regain my own consciousness and realise the world she had forced me into, I changed my mind. I didn’t want to go back and make sure my little self wasn’t such a bully.

(This part will be split into two. I want to space out writing these. They are very painful to relive. The rest will be posted in a few days).

…

“Hey, Gabby?”

Sometimes the giant needle in the back of my head became loose.

And it allowed me to… think again. It brought back my senses; my ability to breathe for myself, to think, and move my lips, and force my own words into my throat. The first time the needle came out, I could hear again. Through my own strangled cries as the spike in my head slid back out with a wet sounding squelch, I was dragged back to a reality I didn’t want—and yet I was reaching out for it with everything I had, desperate to find my twelve-year-old self I’d left behind. That was the me I knew. The body I had was a stranger. The face I had was a stranger. 

The voice I had? She was a stranger. 

She was older. Fourteen, or maybe even fifteen. High school age. I wasn’t concentrating on my own mangled rasp when I managed to whisper for help. No, all I could hear was a man. A man who was lying on the table Cal usually lay on. His voice was both familiar, and a stranger. 

But it was enough for me to hold onto reality. Even if it was just for a second. There were only rare moments when we could talk to each other. Between all of the screaming, the agony plunging me into the dark and then pulling me back out— as well as our combined sobbing—- sometimes there was just those tiny moments where there was no pain, no crying and screaming and begging for our parents.   We managed to talk. It was barely coherent sometimes, what with us only half awake, half alive, while our fake versions battled to take back control.

I remember wondering if Cal had a cold, or maybe it wasn’t Cal. Maybe they had replaced my best friend because his voice wasn’t supposed to sound like that. It sounded older. Mature. Like his father.

I only knew the squeaky Callen, where his voice had almost been as high as mine.

“Yeah?” I whispered.

“Hi.”

He didn’t say anything after that, only sputtering out a giggle which turned into a sob. I didn’t think about it at the time, but it was probably the drugs they were pumping into us to keep us docile. Though I still appreciated it. Even if he sounded like a high schooler. I treasured those moments when I was myself again. And they were themselves again. 

We could talk. Even if it hurt—even when Mr Baudelaire came back to send us spiralling.

The first time was short. It was around three minutes, and I spent most of it trying to remember what my mommy looked like. But there was just fog. I knew I had a mom, and I remembered sitting in front of her and trying to get her to talk to me or eat, but her face had been wiped from my memory. In her place was Emmaline Odair from every angle, a smile splitting open her mouth. She was everywhere, inside every thought, conversations I had with her and how much I loved her as a best friend. That thought was practically embedded inside my brain. I loved her. 

I  didn’t open my eyes. I didn’t want to. 

Time had passed. I wasn’t sure how long, but if it was enough time for Callen to sound way older then he was, and my own voice to adopt a weirdly nasally tone, I didn’t want to know.

It’s weird. I don’t think the thought had truly registered. I was older. Way older than I had been when I’d been kidnapped. I had memories which weren’t mine, where a stranger had taken over my body and walked the halls with Emmaline Odair, like I was in some cheap Mean Girls knock off. But there was something else, something darker I didn’t want to revisit. I was tied to a chair in front of a flashing screen. 

It was pitch black, and shadows wearing masks loomed over me, their identities bleeding into the black. I couldn’t move. I couldn’t… think. There was just the screen and nothing else. And this version of me Emmaline had created couldn’t look away. No. I steeled myself, clenching my fists under velcro straps pinning me down. 

Before I could delve into splintered memories which belonged to the stranger, I shoved them to the back of my head. I didn’t want to know what she had turned me into. The plastic version of me. A doll who obeyed every command. Just a glimpse at my teenage-self, applying makeup with a giant dead eyed grin, was enough for me to know I didn’t want to peek into this fake world I’d been plunged inside as Emmaline’s best friend.

So, instead of opening my eyes, I focused on Callen’s sharp gasps for breath, on the edge of hyperventilating. And then Isadora’s sobs she was trying to hold in. Callen’s voice might have been older and deeper, but he still sounded like a kid; he still had that hysterical edge to his tone. I could sense his heaving chest through every word. “Do you think…”  Cal let out a hiss, and I could hear him violently rattling in his restraints.

“… we deserve this?”

The gravity of Cal’s words didn’t really hit me.

There was something in my mouth, choking my throat and tainting my teeth.

It tasted…tangy. Like I’d swallowed a cent.

I didn’t realise my eyes were open until I was being blinded by intense white light. The white room. I knew it well. I knew its four walls of pristine nothing staring back at me. I knew the ceiling had exactly 412 tiles. I counted them when Mr Baudelaire initially drilled into my skull. Counting didn’t help. I thought it would, I thought it would be a distraction—something to hang onto. 

Once he’d figured out what I was doing, the man had ordered Emmaline to blindfold me. So I had to endure it. I had to hear it, the drilling. The constant, constant sound of my skull being splintered apart for a device which would take me away for a long, long time. I remember wondering if I was going to lose all of my blood.

I could feel it, warm and wet dripping down my neck.  Neverland, Mr Baudelaire had teased. Shaking away the memory, I twisted my head, wincing when I felt the incision point in my skull scathe the prick of the needle. There was a figure lying on Callen’s bed—a figure pinned down with velcro staps. A figure staring up at the ceiling with half-lidded eyes, an almost smile curving on his lips. But it couldn’t have been Cal. Callen was twelve years old. He had a stupid baby face and freckles I used to play with. 

My Callen had been scrawny and oddly shaped, a Pinocchio-like nose and a crooked smile. I didn’t see what older Callen looked like, his face was basked in merciless shadow. But I wanted to. Part of me was desperate to know if I would even recognise him anymore. “Do you think we were too mean?” 

Callen may have sounded older, but his tone was still that of a kid. He cocked his head to the side, and I wondered if he too was counting the ceiling tiles. I didn’t know who his question was directed at. Isadora was lying on her side. I knew she was awake, though she wasn’t talking. Isadora never talked to us. I thought about his words for a moment. Were we too mean to Emmaline Odair? Thinking back, I remembered the three of us surrounding her bed calling her names and laughing.

I remembered her eyes filling with tears. Yes. That is what I thought. Yes, we were way  too mean to her. Especially me. I made her life a misery because I felt my own pain. And I made her feel it too. I made her feel the loneliness which had been swallowing me up and suffocating me since my mom had stopped talking to me all together. I pushed all my pain onto her, and I couldn’t take that back.

Yes, of course we were too mean to Emmaline Odair.

We were bullies.

What I said to Callen, however, was different. My outside voice was far crueller than my inside one. It had no mercy for the girl who had worn a mask the whole time we had known her—who had lured us to her house and torn away our free will like we were nothing. “No. She deserved it,” I said. With those words came power I thought I’d lost. Power when I made her cry and pushed her over in the playground. 

The bitch could do what she wanted to me, I thought, poison trickling through me.

She could mind control me, turn me into her mindless friend—even kill me when she’d gotten bored. But it would never stop her from being the biggest freak in the 6th grade. “Emmaline Odair deserved everything we did to her.” I spat through a mouthful of blood. I turned away from him and pressed my face into a pillow drenched with red. I could already hear footsteps coming down the hallway, but I wasn’t scared. Emmaline and Mr Baudelaire had taken that away from me. 

They had stripped me of all emotion and feeling until I was only feeling one; and that particular one had my heart in a vice-grip. When the doors flew open, and Cal started to cry again, heavy sobs rattling in my ears, I squeezed my eyes shut against my own tears and willed myself not to freak out like him. I wouldn’t give them the satisfaction of knowing that they were hurting me. Mr Baudelaire’s footsteps were getting closer, and suddenly his breath was in my face, his palmy fingers grasping the needle and plunging it back inside my head. 

Then he was forcing me to sit up and making me spit blood into a metal bowl. Apparently, I’d bitten through my tongue during his observation. Once the needle was sandwiched back inside my head, penetrating muscle and bone, I felt something like a pulse, a wave, which slammed into me, bringing sharp bolts of electricity with it. My body suddenly went limp against the mountain of pillows I was lying on, and through fraying lashes I could see the butler’s smile growing wider and wider. I couldn’t move. Not my body, or even my eyes. The sound was drowned out, my vision turning cloudy and nonsensical. Like I was entering a dream. 

Callen’s cries were still there, but growing faded, as the thing inside my head took control. And while I fell, no longer with a body, with a voice, he turned back to Callen. I don’t remember much after that. But I don’t need to. The reason why I’m telling you this isn’t because of the first time I managed to wake up. It was the second time. The second time was different because I didn’t wake up lying down.

 I woke up running.

There was a hand clasped in mine, oblivion in front of me, a silhouette staggering in front. At first, I couldn’t figure out where I was. I wasn’t in the white room, or any other room in the Odair house I knew from the stranger’s memories. I was somewhere darker. Colder. Tunnels. Icy concrete slithered between my bare toes and my head… hurt. It was the type of pain I would rather die than endure, rather come to an abrupt stop and give in than keep going. 

When my hand gingerly grazed the back of my throbbing head, I felt something warm, something wet and familiar slick between my fingertips. The pressure of the needle was gone. But I didn’t feel relief. I didn’t feel anything—far hollower and emptier than I was the last time I woke up. The hand holding mine was familiar. I felt her tight grasp, her fingers entangled in mine. Isadora. I heard her panicked breaths in sync with my own, the wet slap of her feet on cold concrete beneath us. As for the shadow leading us, they were far more erratic the way they ran, their steps stumbled as they fell over themselves pushing to run faster. We came to a turn in the tunnel. Two paths. I couldn’t breathe.

I couldn’t think straight. All I could think of was that this was a bad idea, and Emmaline wasn’t going to like it. Except those weren’t my thoughts. They were the product of the device which had been drilled into my skull. My own thoughts were hard to find, hard tor reach for.  Who was I? Gabby. I was twelve years old. I had a mother and a father. I liked watching Spongebob and playing in the park with my friends. 

A sharp sob escaped my lips and the sound almost brought me staggering to a halt. I’d aged again. Older. I was older. Older than I had been the last time. I was a lot taller and my hair was longer, a fringe hanging in my eyes. My lips tasted like raspberry gloss. Gross. It wasn’t just my weight and height which was different though. There was a steely feeling in my bones like I was made of metal. She was weightless. While I stumbled over my own feet, the stranger’s body’s reflexes easily led me over holes in the ground, her hands curled into fists I knew would cause damage. I wondered if there was even anything left of me as the shadow pushed me left down a far narrower tunnel illuminated with bright white light. Daylight.

“We’re almost there.” Isadora’s murmur relaxed the knot in my gut.

“Come on, Gabby!” Callen’s voice was deeper, a fully-fledged adult. But it was him. I knew it was him. I knew his hysterical; breaths teetering on the edge.

I knew all of him despite his adult tone. I felt his rough hands on my back, slick with something warm, something which dampened the back of my shirt. He shoved me further and I was right. The closer we got to the end of the tunnel, the sight drew a sharp breath from my lungs. Daylight.

It was beautiful, illuminating sharp edges of the tunnel and murky drain water we were splashing through. But it was escape. It was home. Mom. Her face was still foggy in my mind, but I was sure if I saw what she looked like, I would remember her. 

That thought motivated me to push myself faster until the light was encompassing us and I was seeing splashes of deep, dark red. I saw it on my own hands first, splashed all over my arms and staining the knee-length dress I was wearing. Then my gaze was wandering and I was finding what the darkness had hidden from my oblivious eyes. Once the tunnel filled with an intense allure, I realised what the light was. Flashlights.

Flashlights, which danced up and down, tracking us. And once they found us, we came to a clumsy stop. Isadora was next to me. She didn’t look like the Isadora I knew. She looked like her older sister.

I knew her pigtails and her wide smile. In front of me was a teenager with cavernous eyes and a twist in her lips I wanted to ignore. Her gaze was pinpointed on the flashlights, and the figures behind them. I understand the way she was standing, an almost feral and animalistic stance. 

Because I felt it too. It’s weird. While the stranger in my body was urged forwards to use her hands as weapons and flatten each and every one of the figures behind the light, I steeled myself. I pushed her back. The blood on my hands made sense—it was mine, right? That’s what I told myself as my eyes tracked more red. 

It was everywhere, drenching the three of us, painting us like we were red’s canvas. “Get back!” The man’s voice sliced into the silence, followed by the click of firearms being readied.

I didn’t understand why they were pointing guns at us. They had come to rescue as hadn’t they?

“But… why?”

Callen took a step forward despite their yelling. He held up his hands, trembling. “We just… we just want to go home.

His voice was a mixture of adult and child, hysterics wracking his chest and yet and remarkable poise.

“Get. Fucking. Back.”

The shadows weren’t listening to him.

They weren’t just angry, I thought dizzily.

They were scared.

I sensed they were trembling, clammy hands wrapped around weapons in clumsy grasps.

Isadora violently pulled me back when I tried to follow him. The shadows hiding behind their flashlights staggered back, muffled yelling slicing into my ears. “Get back!” They yelled again, “Get… get your hands down, Blackwood! Stand down!”

Another step.

Callen wasn’t afraid of their light. “I just want to go home,” he choked out. “I want to see my… my mom… and my dad.”

“I won’t ask you again,” one of the men growled. “I’ll shoot your fuckin’ head off!”

“Will you though?”

Callen was calm. Calmer than he had been. I don’t think I’d ever heard him talk back to an adult before we were kidnapped.

“I mean it, Blackwood.”

A light hit me and I squinted, shading my eyes. “You too, Wednesday.” His light bounced to Isadora. “Matthews.”

Confusion was a whirlwind inside of my head. I didn’t… understand. It didn’t make sense that they were pointing weapons at us when we were the ones who needed rescuing, when we needed to be taken back to our parents because something was very… wrong with us. And then clarity hit. When I was staring at the back of Callen’s skull and saw the abyssal hole inside where Mr Baudelaire had drilled. 

Before I could stop myself I was looking further, allowing my gaze to fully take him in. At first, it was because I’d missed him. I missed his baby face and dimpled grin. But all of that was gone. All of that was in the past, and in its place was a stranger wearing his face. I knew his thick dark brown hair and pale eyes, freckles dancing across his cheeks. What I didn’t know, however, was blood spattering his cheeks, chin and lips like he’d pressed his mouth to pooling red and drank deep. 

Oh. The realisation hit me once I caught the slight curl in his lip, the flicker in his eye caught in blinding light bathing his face. Callen was holding something, grasping it between narrow fingers and waving it in the air like a prize—and once I knew what it was, I was taking steps back before I was screamed at not to move. 

To put my hands up. Vomit crept up my throat, but the other part of me revelled in Cal’s catch. The thing scrunched between his fist was oddly shaped. It was a head, but only half of one. The other half had been ripped cleanly away, leaving a grotesque mush of bulging eyes attached to mangled flesh. That was the sight that made me surrender, that sent me to my knees, pulling a petrified Isadora with me.

I had to look at my own hands to second-guess myself, to see if I too was carrying a head. I wasn’t, but that didn’t mean the scarlet covering me was all mine. I had already glimpsed a splinter of something else being done to us when I had last woken open, and this time it was in full force. Whatever happened in that room with the TV and the flashing lights in my eyes.. That is what this was. 

It was how Callen had ripped off someone’s head and barely seemed fazed, why I too was desensitised to horrific gore splattered around me. 

Emmaline wasn’t just turning us into her best friends, I thought, obeying hissed orders to stay on the ground with my hands behind my head. 

She was doing something else. I pressed my face into the concrete and no matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t choke down the stranger’s laugh—her laugh. It was heaving in my chest, a psychotic splutter shattering what was left of me. It wasn’t just my body which was changing, which was being moulded into something else, my mind was being rewired to find this funny. To enjoy imploding red on concrete walls and heads being pulled off, to be exhilarated by horrific pain.  Callen reluctantly dropped down next to me, and I watched what was left of the man’s head hit the concrete with a wet sounding smack. I pretended not to see the grin splitting his mouth apart.  I pretended not to feel exactly what he was feeling, a sickening satisfaction twisting itself inside of me and the overwhelming urge to launch myself at the shadows, to claw into their flesh and pluck their eyes out of their sockets. And with every one of their screams—

I would…

I would laugh.

My thoughts danced as a tranquiliser slid into the flesh of my arm, rough arms restraining me.

But I kept thinking, as the stranger with my body and I became entangled.

One.

... 

The memory hit me like a wave of ice cold water swallowing me up. It was like my brain had short circuited for a moment. I was aware of a buzzing red light flickering in front of me before flashing out of existence. Blinking rapidly, the harrowing dark of the tunnel faded and I was kneeling on my kitchen door with my weight pinning a squirming Callen to the refrigerator. My grip on him loosened slightly, now I knew what he was capable of; what my memories had showed me. Still though, I searched for what was still there, still clinging on, when the worst had been done to us. My eyes stung and I grasped the collar of his shirt, trying to find anything which was him. But I just saw that light.

I saw that feral flare I’d glimpsed in the tunnel—but now it had fully taken him over, moulding his body into not just a plastic doll for Emmaline to play with. A soldier, or a guard of some sort. “Cal.” I bit back a sob and shook him. “Cal, it’s Gabby,” I tightened my grip when he lunged forward and tried to slam his head into mine. “You need to tell me what’s happening,” I whispered. “They… they did something to us. Do you remember? The party we went to?” I couldn’t help it, my resolve crumbling. It was killing me seeing him like that. He was a shell of his former self. “You’re all grown up.” He stiffened when I cradled his face, sputtering cries I couldn’t stop.

“You’re all grown up, but I know it’s still you.” Again, I searched for any inclination of awareness or emotion on his face and was met with nothing. Just a curl in his lip and a gleam in his eye. I ran my hand through his hair, feeling along the indentations in the back of his skull, a scar which was no doubt the result of Mr Boulder’s drilling nine years ago. “Callen.” I shook him again, growing impatient. I couldn’t stand that blank look, the twitch in his expression and his body when I relaxed my grip.

I wasn’t getting through to him. Whatever had been done to him was deeper than the thing in my head. “Tell me what’s going on!” I squeaked, gesturing behind me. “What did Rich Bitch and her family do to us? Come on, you need to wake—”

“Up.” The word flew through my lips in a rasp with the last of my breath. I’d let my guard down. The nineteen year old girl in my body was strong, something had definitely been done to her, I had splintered memories to prove it. But Cal was stronger. There was so much I wanted to tell him, and the words were entangled on my tongue, when all of the air was suddenly knocked from my lungs. 

I was aware my mouth was open, and the toe of his shoe was plunging into my gut, sending me toppling onto my back. Callen followed, like an animal, straddling me and grasping hold of my neck. Before his fingers could wrap around my throat, I was reacting on instinct once more. When he changed tactic and threw a punch with enough force to do some serious damage to my face, I grabbed and twisted his arm. 

But he was fast. Way too fast. Faster than I’d ever imagined, or what I thought was capable of a human being. He didn’t even flinch. There was no pain flashing on his face, or even an indication that I’d hurt him. I used the time between figuring out I was going to lose the fight, while he slowly rose to his feet—to scramble back on my hands. I planned to dive to my feet and make a break for the door, but his eyes were calculating my every move. 

I chose to jump to my feet. I chose to face him and not back down. I thought I could take him down with a kick to the groin, but he just deflected it and grabbed me by my throat once again, lifting me into the air, my legs dangling. My brain burned, my body, every instinct inside me battling to fight back despite black spots blooming in my vision. 

There was something which confused me. Callen had the strength to snap my neck with one flick of his hand if he wanted to—and yet he was choosing to be slow, choosing to squeeze the life out of me himself. With panic filling me like poison, I reached out blindly, attempting to plunge my thumbs into his eyes which caught him off guard, though not long enough for me to gain the upper hand. 

Instead, he slammed me into the countertop and leaned close, heavy breaths in my face. “Oh, yeah.” Cal chuckled. It was the first time I’d heard him laugh since we were kids. It was still the same laugh, but there was a hollowness to it. “Something is definitely loose,” he murmured, swinging me like a toy. 

Getting closer, I saw the red light again. This time pinpointed his pupils. “You’re thinking, aren’t you? Without her in your head.” Pressing pressure to my throat finger by finger, I realised he was enjoying himself. He was practically shivering in pleasure as I felt my body start to shut down as my gasps for breath grew more desperate. When I squeezed my eyes shut, his icy lips found my ear.

“You know Emmaline doesn’t like it when we think without her.”

Tighter.

“Can you… tell me what it feels like?” He murmured, “To think… without her inside every thought?”

Tighter, he squeezed.

“To feel…” Callen let out a sharp breath. His fingers around my throat jerked. “Without her?”

He laughed to my surprise. And I felt his whole body vibrate with laughter. “Emmaline is going to be so happy,” he said dreamily. “That I caught you. I actually caught you! And she’s… she’s going to love us even more. Because she’s amazing. She's ours."

Tighter.

“Isn’t she amazing, Gabby?” He urged me to agree. “Aren’t we just… so fucking lucky to have her inside our head?”  

There was a knife on the counter, I remembered.

If I moved my body a few inches to the right and used his as a push up, I could use my left arm to grasp for the handle, swing it forwards and drive the blade into his head. With the thought taking over my mind, my cotton candy thoughts were suddenly filled with the idea of Cal’s blood splattering my own face and the walls as my knife penetrated his brain, his body slumping to the right and hitting the floor with a meaty smack. 

A shiver crept down my spine. But it wasn’t the fear of that happening. It was anticipation, a whole new sensation taking me over from the inside;  unbridled pleasure I didn’t know or understand in this body. I wanted to kill him. I wanted to ram my knife into his head over and over again until he was squirming flesh beneath me, and I didn’t care. In the back of my mind where I had been in denial, this body, this poisoned brain, had no empathy or restraint. 

Before those hurricane thoughts could send me over the edge, and I knew I was close, my arm reaching, reaching, reaching for the countertop, blindly scratching for the wooden handle of the knife.. Callen dropped me. Just like that, his fingers slipped from my throat. I barely felt the impact, only sucking air into my lungs with a strangled breath, my hands already going to massage my throat. I was okay. I was almost choked to death and I was okay.

My body was shaken, sure, but it was already urging me to get back up and kill him for real. Before I could, I realised the atmosphere had changed. 

Callen was no longer trying to kill me, and when I peered through foggy vision, there was a figure standing by the door. Daniel. 

The boy claiming to be my brother was frowning at the two of us, his arms folded across his chest. He didn’t look horrified or even shocked.

 Instead, his lip was curving from a frown into what looked like a smile, an amused glint in his eyes. Seeing him brought me back to reality, where the kitchen was destroyed, and I was a crumpled heap on the floor with my hands already wrapped around a knife. Callen had adopted a plastic smile on a nonchalant face. He held out his hand for me to grab. “Sorry, Gabby.” He chuckled. “I didn’t mean to knock you over.”

“Oh no, you guys continue!” Daniel stepped into the kitchen, almost tripping over a chair tipped on its side. “I never thought I’d see you two re-enacting WWE Smackdown in our kitchen, but here we are.” He kicked a plate out of the way with a scoff.

I watched him warily head to the refrigerator, pulling it open and pulling out an apple. He took a bite and propped himself up against the door, nodding at Callen. “Hey, Cal. It’s nice to see you anywhere else which ain’t up your girlfriend’s ass.”

My “brother” waved the apple with a smirk, speaking through a mouthful. “Figuratively, of course.”

“Daniel.” Callen gave an awkward wave. He leaned against the countertop, easily slipping back under his façade. “Can I borrow your sister for a while?” 

The moment the words had left his mouth, I attempted to dive to my feet, but he was already moving in three strides across the kitchen, wrapping an arm around my shoulder. To any other, it looked like he was teasingly throwing his arms around me like a friend would. And he had in the past. I’d lost count of how many times Cal would playfully snake his arms around my neck. This was different. 

I felt his fingernails brush across the back of my head, digging into the incision point. I felt my body jolt against his, but he just held me tighter, his smile growing freakishly large until Daniel was raising a brow. “There’s a presentation Emmaline and her family are doing tonight, and Gabriella and I are honorary guests.”

“Hm?” Daniel cocked his head. “Oh, yeah sure. Knock yourself out! Like you almost did in here."

His gaze flickered to me for a moment. “Can I talk to you a sec, Gabs?”

I found myself nodding and following him out onto the hallway. Callen didn’t follow to my surprise. He stayed in the kitchen, unmoving, his gaze on the knife I’d managed to pry from my own fingers and the scary thoughts which engulfed my brain had faded. Daniel didn’t stop in the hallway. He kept going up the stairs, leaping up each one. When we were alone, and I was sure Callen was still downstairs, I opened my mouth to start screaming. I didn’t know what I was going to tell him, but anything was good enough, if it meant getting out of that house. 

Before I could, though, he was yanking me into his room with a desperation which was new. Daniel pulled a jump rope from where he’d wrapped it around his waist and tied it around the ornate handle. I noticed his hands were shaking. 

When he straightened up, it hit me that I wasn’t looking at the kid who was apparently my brother. I was staring at a performer. The smile which had been glued to his face downstairs was wiped from his lips, replaced with a twisted scowl and ignited eyes filled with emotion I didn’t even understand; a hollowness he was failing to hide. “Okay.” Daniel heaved out a breath and tightened the rope before resting his head against the door.

“Fuck. Okay, this is happening. I can do this.” He told rough wood before twisting back around to face me, his lips stretching into that fake smile once more. This time, though, there was truth and clarity behind it. “My bedroom window is open,” He gestured over my shoulder. “It’s a pretty bad drop, but as long as you land on grass you should be okay.” The boy surprised me with a choked out laugh. “Actually, considering what these bastards have done to you guys, you’ll be fine either way.”

I don’t know how I managed coherent words. “You’re helping me?”

Daniel shrugged. “Of course,” he said, “What kind of fake brother would I be if I didn’t?”

His words set something off inside me and I started to demand to know what was happening, but the boy was already two steps ahead of me. “We’ve got maybe two minutes.” His gaze went to the jump rope around the handle. “If that holds.”

“Who are you?” Was my first question.

He smiled a little. “Straight out of college, and what gig do I get? The Truman Show without it being televised. I tried to get out, but they threatened to take away my free will. Which I’d rather have. So, here I am.” Daniel tipped his head back and sighed. “Playing the part of your little brother who has no personality and goes to the refrigerator every half an hour.”

“Like a movie?” I whispered.

He laughed, keeping a wary eye on the door. “I keep forgetting you three are still mentally in the sixth grade. Look, this isn’t a movie. Nothing is being televised. This isn’t the fucking Hunger Games.” Catching himself, Daniel’s lip curled. “Or maybe, in a way, it is? Huh. I never thought about it like that.” He shook his head. “I’m getting off track. What you need to know is this whole goddamn town is built around you three. Nine years ago that psycho bitch Emmaline Odair and her family took you hostage, and obviously, the town tried to get you back. You’re little kids, of course they would.” I opened my mouth to tell him I wasn’t a kid anymore, but he shushed me. “Anyway. The town was eager to get you back until they found out what exactly it was that her family had done to you.” 

Daniel mimed an explosion with his hands. “Mind control.” He breathed. “Fucking mind control, man. None of that MKultra shit, I’m talking taking control of the mind and turning innocent children into mindless slaves—and something else entirely.” He groaned. “It wasn’t long before the government in the outside world figured out what was going on, and they wanted to know how far Emmaline’s family could go. They wanted to see how far they could push a human being, and if it was possible to turn them into…” 

He drifted off when my eyes went wide, and barf crept up my throat. “Gabby, this whole thing is just one big fucked up experiment disguised as a mentally unhinged girl’s fantasy.” Daniel took a step back, his lip curling. “Everyone wins. The Odair’s have their minions, and the higher ups fund whatever messed up technology they’ve put inside here.” He prodded my right temple with dark eyes. “Fucked up, right?”

When I couldn’t speak, the boy sighed. “If it’s any consolation, I never bought into the fake doll she turned you into.”

“How do I get out?” I rasped. Suddenly, I couldn’t breathe. “I need to…. I need to get out.”

He nodded. “You and me both. Do you know what happened to the last Daniel?” The boy shivered. “Before they brought me in, I heard he’d managed to escape the wall and was caught before he could break out. Escapee’s are caught and either experimented on or put to a better use.” His gaze flicked to the floor. “Most of them are just made into town’s people.”

My mind was in overdrive. “Cal and Isadora,” I managed to grit out, “How do I get them back?”

His expression crumpled. “Uh.. I mean, it’s not my place to tell you so you should figure it out on your own…” He drifted off, changing the subject. “It’s messed up what the Odair’s are doing to you. But just remember: If you shut this thing down, she’ll have no choice but to let us all go. If you kill Cal and Isadora, her most powerful guards are down, and so is the technology the higher ups and are googly eyes for. Then what does she have, huh? Anyone with self-awareness will fight.”

“Kill them?!” I shook my head rapidly, clamping my hands over my ears. “No, no, no, no!”

Daniel adopted a look of sympathy. He reached out and awkwardly patted me. “Gabby, Callen and Isadora aren’t exactly—”

A sudden shriek sent my heart into my throat.

“Daniel!” A little girl was running up the stairs. “Daniel, you’re not allowed to take off your mic!”

“Ignore Stella.” Daniel pressed himself against the door. “The Odair’s adopted her a few years ago, and she’s insisted on inserting herself into Emmaline’s psychotic fantasy. Which means I have to play older brother to the little gremlin,” He tugged at his shirt. “I pulled off my mic, so I’m expecting Cal at the door in three… two… one…” 

He stiffened up when the door suddenly trembled, and he struggled to steel it shut.” I remembered Callen holding half of a head in my memory and found myself stumbling back on instinct. Daniel hissed out. “If Callen Blackwood gets through that door, we’re toast.” He said, squeezing his eyes shut. “You need to knock me out, okay? Just don’t… don’t fucking kill me. I’ve got a mom and little bro.”

“Daniel!” Stella screeched. “Daniel, I’m telling Emmaline! You’re ruining everything!”

The door was close to flying off of its hinges. Just another shove and Callen would be through.

“Uh, hello?!” Daniel yelled over the little girl’s screaming. “Knock me out! Come on, KO me!”

“Against the door?!” I shrieked.

“Yes, against the door!” Daniel was struggling under the weight of the rattling door. “If you don’t knock me out, they’ll think I helped you. I’ll tell them I talked to you about something Stella related, and you pulled off my mic and knocked me out. They already know your device is fried, so it won’t exactly be surprising to them that you’ve woken up and gone psycho.”

“But—”

“Just do it!”

I checked the window first, my stomach twisting into knots at the drop. It was at least a broken ankle if landed wrong, and that was if I landed on grass. Still though, It was a broken ankle or being captured again. Sucking in a breath, I gathered hold of myself. I was twelve years old, I thought. I wasn’t a little girl anymore. I wasn’t scared. I didn’t look at Daniel when I slammed the knuckles of my fist into his face over and over again until he crumpled against the door, his head hanging, blood pooling down his chin. I didn’t have time to check if he was okay. 

I was on my knees, lifting Daniel’s head with my index finger and wincing at streaks of red running in rivulets down pasty skin, when the door finally cracked under pressure and flew open. Stella skipped in first, settling me with a scowl before screaming when she saw Daniel. Callen followed, but I only saw his shadow behind me as I lunged for the window. 

Before I could heave my body onto the sill, warm hands were grasping my legs and violently yanking me back. Callen. This time I didn’t hesitate. I don’t remember fighting him, only a blur of dodging his hits and throwing my own before I grasped hold of his head and slammed it as hard as I could against the wall. His eyes flashed again, but this time his head twitched, and he let go, blinking rapidly. 

With him caught off guard, I used the time to dive for the open window. In the corner of my eye, Callen was still jolting, his eyes flickering, lips opening and closing, as he slowly turned around to face me. His eyes were still blank, still controlled by the device. But something had become… undone.

Unlike me, it was a different type of undoing.

Callen adopted a grin I’d never seen before—unlike any other under Emmaline’s control.

I didn’t stay around to see what exactly had happened to him. Once again, the stranger controlled my body, holding me perfectly poised on the sill, before diving onto the ground below. I jumped, and then landed, my body slumping forwards.

Maybe it was my spinning head taking me off balance, or the impact itself, but I rolled over twice, before hitting the sidewalk, slamming my head into the curb. Stars exploded in my eyes. A bright flash, and I was somewhere else.  I was back inside that room. It was the room I’d tried to push out of my head. Strapped in a chair, I couldn’t move my arms. The movie screen in front of me was full of hazy colors, and I followed each one, and then a purple dot which bounced from corner to corner.

"Now commencing... Project Albatross. Trial one-- attempt two."

A familiar voice which made my eyes sting, the word was on my tongue, tangled, but I couldn't say it.

I knew that voice.

I had been… looking for her everywhere.

My mind blurred, and the movie screen was suddenly filled with… red. I was seeing glistening red gore, entrails and headless torso’s. Something sharp stuck into the back of my head. Next to me, two figures. Also strapped down. They were still.

Unmoving.

Their gazes were stuck to the screen, and even in the dark I could see that they were… smiling.

Classical music in my ears drowning out my screams, and their laughter.

And that voice, a robotic murmur torn of emotion. "Attempt three.

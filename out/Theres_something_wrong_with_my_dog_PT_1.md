I've had my dog for I'd say... a solid 4 years now? She isn't a small dog either. Her name is Laila and she is a German Sheppard I adopted from a shelter.

Now Laila has always been a good dog... nothing was wrong with her physically or mentally.

This is a big deal because recently she's been getting these weird fungal spots on her paws. I took her to the vet and they treated them, said they had never seen anything like them. The spots were black and filled with puss.

I stopped letting her outside it stopped for a while, but they only came back.

Now I live on my acre of land, just me and my dog in our house. We have neighbors but they're fenced off from us. I've had grounds men come check out my property but they didn't find any traces of any fungi. I knew it wasn't something she was eating either.

Now one day I woke up and did my normal routine. I checked on Laila, brushed my teeth then hopped in the shower. As I was showering my back I noticed a deformity on my skin. I used a mirror and aimed it at my back and found numerous of the same fungal spots now on MY back! I quickly threw on clothes and rushed to the nearest MD now. 

When I arrived to the MD now they told me it was also unknown of what fungi was on my back. They gave me medicine to treat the spots and they slightly went away. I tried to calm down and rest for the day and just assumed whatever it was must've been contagious from Laila.

I went to bed at my usual time, made sure to apply the treatment and shower beforehand of course. But when I went to bed I just couldn't sleep. I noticed Laila wasn't asleep either? I went to Laila and observed her, that's when I realized how dried out her eyes were and how sluggish she was. I simply rubbed it off as part of this "Fungal Disease". I took her with me downstairs to get some water, to put on her eyes and to drink. 

That's when I noticed it. In the corner of the living room a mound of just... black lied there. It looked like a pile of dirt in a way, but it was also shiny? I took my phone and observed it. It looked as if it were... slowly growing? I gasped as I pieced the two things together. Whatever it was must've been the issue. 

I quickly called my groundskeeper, the only person I knew who dealt with fungi. It took a while but he finally arrived. I told him where it was and he seemed shocked. The fungus was definitely larger from when I first noticed it and it seemed as if it slowly branched out as it increased in size. The groundskeeper put on gloves and took a shovel, driving it into the mass. 

That's when I felt a severe pain all along the spots. It was as if adrenaline pumped into my veins. I looked at my body and I turned red. I could hear Laila whimpering at exactly the same time, followed by a menacing growl. I couldn't control myself anymore. My body moved to the man as I slammed him against the walls in my grasp. I started to cry internally, it felt almost as if my entire bodily system was taken under control. Suddenly Laila came running down. It looked at the man in the face, his head turned red as he struggled to breathe. Laila began to ravage at his body. She took parts of his flesh off and eventually limbs. I lost myself as I helped her. We dismantled the man and dropped him into the mound. The mound slowly consumed the parts of his body and grew. 

The mound now sat in the corner, the size of a small sofa chair I'd say. Both me and Laila were released. We both howled in pain and cried. The fact we just killed somebody broke me. I sat down staring at the mound shaking. The spots on my back felt as if they burnt. I took Laila with me to the car and we both drove far away.

Now we are currently at a hotel a few miles from my house. I'm writing this now wondering what I should do. Please... I need help.

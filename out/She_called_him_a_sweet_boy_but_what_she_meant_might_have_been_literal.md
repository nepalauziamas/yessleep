I was walking down town one calm quiet evening. Nobody was around and it was getting dark. I got off the left sidewalk and crossed the road. I continued forward on the right sidewalk as it was going throughout the park.

I started my jogging around the park's pond, taking note of some benches on my second loop around. On my third loop I saw a woman sitting on a single bench and her dog was on the ground. On my final loop I walked over and sat on the bench opposite of her.

I took out my metal water bottle and drank some water. I looked around at the beautiful scenery. The grass, the foliage, the flowers, the trees. The birds chirping, the fish splashing in the pond. I could smell the fresh grass and feel the wind. I got so relaxed that I wanted to listen to some music on YouTube, so I took out my ear buds and put them on.

Before I could play anything I overheard the woman speak.

“Such a good boy! Such a sweet boy!”

I looked in her direction and realized that she was just talking to her dog. I closed my eyes again and started to get in tune with the music I was playing. However she said something louder, to the point where I overheard some of it.

“Oh… You’re so sweet… So… Delicious”

I looked at the woman in shock and terror as she is biting the dogs belly. Her eyes were widened and she drooled excessively. She bit harder and harder until she ripped a small chunk of flesh out of the dog, causing it to whimper and yelp in pain. The dog started to bleed quickly.

“Hey! Stop hurting your dog!” I said.

The lady chewed and swallowed while staring at me. I angrily tried choking up words but I was getting nervous.“

Lady if you don’t stop now I’m calling the police!”

I stepped backwards as she spoke.

“Stop? Why? I’m just showing my dog how much of a sweet boy he is! Isn’t he adorable?”

I walked away and dialed 911. The lady paid no attention to me as I gave her full description and what she did to her poor dog. The operator said that the cops are on their way and I felt relieved.

I looked back and the dog was laying down in pain. The woman took another bite from the dog, her saliva dripping down on it. I ran towards her and shouted.

“Stop! What the fuck are you doing?!”

She didn’t say anything and placed the dog on the ground. The dog continued to bleed out as it weakly lay on the cold ground. She turned to me with her wide bloodshot eyes and her smile was spread wide.

She got up slowly and bent down to stroke her dog.

“Momma’s gonna be right back sweetie, be a good boy and stay there.”

She looked at me again quickly and started running towards me.

I got the fuck out of there running as fast as I could. I ran block after block turning multiple different times to try and fake her out in case she followed me. I kept running until I found a public area filled with people.

I never saw that woman or her dog again after that day.

Hi i'm Leo. I'm a high school student and i want to tell you about my experiences for the school trip that you might want to go in the future, anyway the trip was fun if you not break the rules especially **curfews.**

**first of all** it's was fun when i think about to go to school trip, me and my friends arrive on time to wait the school bus to take us to the mountain, it's was a lake around with the mountain and it's snow all years. The time is pass so fast we went to the lake skiing and a lot of fun, and now it's dinner time so we decied to go eat some local food around here, we know our cerfews is 10PM but now it's 10:30PM so it's should be fine.

When the food are served the waiter ask us that we are the student from school? so we say yes and i think that kinda queastion that ask because this is a pub restaurant, but they hand us a paper and said **read carefully** and walk away, we are so confused but we decied to read it.

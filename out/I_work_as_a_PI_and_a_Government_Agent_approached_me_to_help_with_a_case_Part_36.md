One the last case, the cost of saving the world turned out to be dyed hair. The purple faded a little after a few days and yet Jimmy still had the nerve to make fun of it. I’d dropped by the office bringing milkshakes for her and Tippie for doing such a good job holding down the fort while I was busy. Tippie looked very happy for a treat. He finished it in record speed as he left ready to hunt for some more lost pets. I found him to be a kind and honest creature that put all his energy into returning animals to their families. Recently we’ve gotten him set up to fix any feral stray cats he could catch and release to combat the over population of them in the city. 

Jimmy drank her milkshake slower while she started to roast her boss.  I decided that her causal remarks about my hair, and lack of a girlfriend were enough to be punished by the remaining of her milkshake getting taken away. When I placed it in the bottom drawer of the desk, I thought her cries were to get it back. As the drawer closed and the locked clicked, I found out she tried to warn me that the bottom drawer didn’t have a key. We both were on the floor, trying to force it open when Nick walked in. He stared from the door trying to decipher what we were trying to do.  

“I locked half a milkshake inside here.” I explained.  

I knew it already tipped over and hoped it didn’t leak too much and soaked into the wood.

“Why...?” He asked slowly. 

I really couldn’t go into an explanation about it without it coming off as more embarrassing as it already was. He joined us, getting down to fiddle with the lock. Jimmy provided a bobby pin for Nick to use.

His hair had yet to grow back from when we styled it. At least most of the purple faded. He got the drawer open and I saw the damage. It would take a while to wash out all the milky strawberry chunks from the wood grain. 

“Where did you learn how to pick locks?” Jimmy asked a bit amazed. 

He even folded back her bobby pin to return it in working order.

“I was bored on bed rest and needed to do something.” He said as he stood back up. 

Nick got forced on bed rest a lot. Here I thought he’d been, well, resting. Instead, he learned some new skills. Aberash would be pissed to find out he did such a thing. Carrying over the drawer to the small sink, I listened to why Nick showed up. 

“There is a drug problem happening we’ve been asked to take a look at.” He started. 

“Why would that have to do with The Corporation?” I asked knowing this drawer was a lost cause but not ready to accept it.  

“Normally substances that affect humans, don’t do anything for supernatural creatures. If they do, it happens for a very short time. What has started to appear is a drug that not only creatures can use, but humans can as well. It's highly addictive, and made from a source almost too gruesome to consider. The magic imbued inside it stays inside a human's system. If they take it too much, they’ll turn into something else.” 

I needed to buy a new desk. Putting that aside, I focused on Nick. This problem really sounded as if it needed to be stopped quickly. When I first moved in with my sister, we stayed with her boyfriend. In the few months I we stayed there, he’d gotten into some pretty heavy stuff. We left really soon after. I’ve never touched anything like that myself and barely ever drank. That one brief encounter enough for me to see what addiction could turn people into, without magic being involved. 

“So, we need to take down a drug operation?” I asked. 

“Sounds kinda scary.” Jimmy chimed in. 

I’d forgotten she was in the room for a second. I didn’t tell her a lot of what I did when it came to Corporation cases. She’d wanted to work for them in an office setting but I poached her. Investigating some drug gang felt pretty minor compared to everything else we’ve done so far. Raising my hand, I felt the part of my ear that been bitten off. I tended to forget I sort of looked like a mysterious agent now.  

“Don’t worry about it. I'm sure it won’t be a big deal. I’ll come back soon and buy you another milkshake.” 

I started to head out of the office ready to get down to work with Nick on my heel. We both ignored his question about why the milkshake was locked away in the first place. 

To my surprise, the case brought us to the same city my sister lived in. I haven't met her in person for a few years. Recently, I’d sent her enough money to buy a used car so she wouldn’t need to worry about her old one breaking down again. I really didn’t think I would be able see her so soon. The case needed to come first, but there could be a chance I could introduce my only family to the person who pretty much became a brother in the last few months.  

We found a hotel room to sit down and got over the case. It felt weird being so close to where my sister lived without seeing her first. Nick put out some photos and I forced myself to pay attention. There were three headshots in a row, with one in top. Nick pointed to a bottom photo of a man with sunken eyes and greasy hair.  

“As far as we can tell, there are three main sellers and one leader of the group. It seems like this man is the weakest link and would be most like to crack. The entire operation is being run by half breeds. However, not much is known about their backgrounds.” 

I picked up the photo to see it labeled with the words Crocodile Waters. Knowing how bad creatures were at naming their kids, I assumed he also got stuck with a horrible name. Or this was a gang name he picked? Though, who in their right mind would use something like that? 

“So, where does he hang out? He must have certain spots where he likes to deal.” I said while putting down the photo. 

“He tends to hang around a nightclub. Finding him should be easy enough. We just need to be careful that he doesn’t run if he becomes aware of us.” Nick said and wrote down the name of the nightclub we would need to check out later that night. 

“Alright, we grab him and beat the information we need out of him. Sounds easy enough.” I commented with a shrug. 

“Using honey in this situation instead of vinegar may be more suitable. He’s already been threatened by rival gangs without giving in. He is the only one we were able to dig up some information on. His sister is ill and he needs a great deal of money for her treatments. He’s risking his life dealing for her. If we pay for her treatments, he should turn to our side.” Nick explained. 

Nick did have a fortune hidden away. He could easily pay for something like that. I didn’t know how I felt about it all. This guy ruined other people's lives for some quick cash. It may be a for a good reason, but I was in a bad situation money wise in the past without turning to this sort of thing. I hoped we could rough him up a little for the harm he caused.  

“Ok, so how are we going to grab him from the nightclub? It’ll be crowded and loud. We’ll need to scout it out first and figure out the floorplan. I wonder if we could go inside before they open to get a good look at it.” 

Looking over the name, I saw it to be a place I’ve never heard of. It must have opened up after I moved. I worked in a lot of bars and clubs busting and cleaning up at the end of the night. Legally, since I was still a student then, I couldn’t be working so late but all those places didn’t care. My finger tapped on the table when an idea came to mind. We didn’t need to hunt him down; he could come to us. 

“You’re right, we can use honey for this job.” 

Nick looked over at me puzzled at my comment. We had all day to get ready for this plan. I could only hope that my partner really didn’t mind acting as bait a second time. I doubted there would be a female agent available. After a quick call, that turned out to be true. Without any solid information, The Corporation couldn’t spare another agent for this job. That meant we needed to go shopping. 

“Are you sure you’re alright with this?” I asked for at least the tenth time that day. 

It was getting late in the day but there was a few more hours until the nightclub opened. Buying the clothing we needed an easy enough task. Trying to figure out what kind of makeup to use took a while though. I was out of touch in the club scene and didn’t know what girls looked like all dressed up nowadays. In the end, we decided we didn’t need to follow any trends. Just make our bait pretty. And my partner really did fit that requirement after we were done with him. 

“It is not a problem. He is more likely to approach a single woman unguarded. I do not even need to speak. He'll follow behind and out of the club if I take his hand. It will be simple, and would not draw attention to us.” Nick explained the plan. 

I still felt uneasy about it. I knew he would be fine. I just didn’t want someone to get all touchy with him. The outfit we picked out looked pretty much the same as the first time Nick needed to dress up. A white button-down shirt with the sleeves rolled up. Black pants, with black heels. I found some simple gold clip on earrings and some bracelets for him to wear. Some foundation and lip-gloss pulled the entire thing together. We debated on if we needed to stuff his shirt. I figured that would make it look too unnatural. So, he was flat, but looked attractive enough that didn’t matter. As long as he didn’t speak, no one would ever be able to tell his real gender. The dim light in the club would help. 

“If he gets handsy, just punch him out.” I said, arms crossed. 

“That would defeat the purpose of this.” 

When did Nick get so much sass? There was still some time before we needed to leave, so I offered to paint his nails black. Some nail polish was on sale and it was an impulse buy. I haven’t painted anyone’s nails since me and my sister were younger. When I got to his pinky nail, I was shocked to see the entire thing missing.  

“What happened here?” I asked him. 

“I used it to heal you on the Velvet Bat case.” He replied holding his hands still so the polish could dry. 

I can’t believe I hadn’t noticed that until now. He said he could use parts of his body to heal, or change others. I’d assumed it would have grown back. When he offered a piece of his liver to change my body, he knew it wouldn't heal. This whole time he’d been missing a nail because he saved his partner. I put away the nail polish to think about what I wanted to say. For a while I wanted to explain myself on why I refused the offer back then. I acted stubborn on getting the last surgery on my own but didn’t fully understand why until recently. 

“Back when I was living with my sister, it was rough on both of us. We were trying to support ourselves and two small kids. During all of that, I saved up for the first surgery. I feel a bit guilty for spending the money on that though. We could have used it for so many other things and I could have waited. But... When I see what I look like now I can see all the hard work I put into it. It took me a really long time to realize I was proud of myself for all the effort. Right now, I’m waiting for after I have enough saved up to take care of my sister and her kids. After that, I can figure out when I can take time off for the last surgery.” 

Nick listened as I spoke with a hint of a smile on his face. He wasn’t upset for the fact I refused his offer and understood the reasoning behind it. There were so few things in life I felt proud of and I never would have thought my appearance would be one of them. Being proud of myself was such an odd feeling I didn’t know how to deal with it. It was so much easier to be proud of Nick for sticking up for himself than reflecting on my own life. When everything was all said and done, I would let Nick change the rest of my body to what it should be. After all, I really couldn’t change my genes, just surface appearance. For right now, I wanted to go at my own pace.  

“After the case I want to introduce you to my sister.” I said finally. 

“I would like that.” 

With all of that out of the way, we needed to go back on the case. We left the hotel, ready for whatever we might come across.

The nightclub a loud obnoxious place and I hated it the moment we walked inside. It far too dark, too hot and the music was just beats rattling the entire building. I peeled away letting Nick sit by the bar so we could look for our target. Within seconds he was bothered by other guys trying to buy the lone pretty thing a drink. He didn’t speak, and even if he did, they wouldn’t have heard him. From what I could tell, he didn't even look at the guys trying to get his attention. It made them curse and sulk off trying to think of a different plan. 

My head might split open if we needed to be here for much longer. Suddenly, Nick stood up. He wove through the crowd to someone wearing a white coat. I moved in closer in time to spot Crocodile's face turn towards who just stopped in front of him. He spoke, but Nick just took his wrist to start guiding the drug dealer to the back door. I was closer to the door, so I slipped into the alleyway and waited for them. The small area dirty, covered in grime and smelled of stale beer. At least it sounded a bit quieter and would be easy to talk out here. 

When Nick dragged the other man out, Crocodile wasted no time making his move. In one swift motion, he placed a hand against the closed club door, pinning Nick to it even though the drug dealer was the shorter of the two. 

“I don’t give out my product for free, but for you I’ll give a discount if you want to do a little favor for me.” Crocodile said in the best seductive tone he could muster. It honestly sounded pretty sad. 

“You know you’re hitting on a male agent, right?” I said, arms crossed watching the scene. 

Our target jumped startled by my voice. He darted to one side and Nick easily got in the way. I stood next to my partner cornering the man in the alleyway. There was a dead end at his back and he couldn’t get past us. Sweat started to appear on his forehead. He was a half breed and didn’t need to carry a weapon. But overly nervous because he didn’t know who ambushed him.

“Agents? Looking like that? Please. You’re probably apart of some other gang trying to scare me off your turf. I mean, since when does The Corporation let their agents dye their hair purple?” He pointed out. 

I looked up at Nick. He really didn’t look like an agent in the slightest. No wonder Ancaer freaked out so much over Nick's hair. Thinking on my feet, I answered. 

“We were recently undercover for a punk band. The dye hasn’t faded.” I lied. 

“Oh? What instrument did you play?” Crocodile said, his mouth starting to form into a half grin.  

We were slowly winning him over. His body relaxed a little noticing how we joked around and didn't try to break his nose. The honey approach working.

“The Tambourine.” Nick said and it caused us both to stare at him. 

His flat tone and honest answer threw us both off guard. I should get an award for not laughing. My face remained still and it hurt holding back snickers. God damn my partner for causally dropping something so funny I would never be able to top it in my entire life if I tried. Crocodile cracked first. He let himself snort shaking his head. 

“I bet you’re looking for me to roll on my boss huh? Well tough luck. I have my reasons for doing this job.” The dealer replied sternly trying to recover some of his dignity. 

“In exchange for information, we’ll pay for your sister’s treatments.” Nick offered. 

That turned out to be not the right thing to say. Crocodile’s face turned into a scowl. His mouth getting so long it might as well have reached his ears. His other side started showing through his anger and voice shifted into something scratchy. 

“She’s my sister! It's my job to take care of here, not yours! If I can’t do that then there isn’t any point of her having me as a brother!” He hissed, eyes blazing. 

I reeled back and punched his shoulder. The shock of the action nearly made him drop his threatening appearance.  

“Don’t be stupid! We’re here to buy information from you, that’s taking care of her! She would be more upset that you’ve been hurting people trying to pay for her treatments!” I snapped. 

The man got taller; his chest wider. His face shifted to a long lizard one with a row of teeth. His hair remained and he needed to push it out from his eyes. Sharp claws glittered as he pointed a finger in my direction. 

“I’m not hurting anyone! They’re making their choices coming by and buying my product! You Corporation stiffs are always wasting your time on nonsense when there are real issues going on!” He shouted back. 

“This drug changes people! How can you say that’s not hurting them!” I fought back, a bit of anger pooling into my stomach. 

He opened his mouth to reply when Nick took a step forward. From his pocket, he pulled out a folded piece of paper that looked like it had been cut from a newspaper. Crocodile still pissed, but more curious over what Nick offered. Snatching it from his hand, he started to read the clipping. His eyes ran along the text a few times. His entire body deflating slowly. His face returned to a human one and shoulders slumped. He went from being an angry monster to looking as if he might be sick.  

“This can’t be right... The Coven isn’t pure. It’s a fake version, we’re not making it from...” Unable to accept what he read, he pulled out his phone to confirm the news article. 

I didn’t know what Nick showed him. For some reason, my partner held back some information about this case. When Crocodile found what he was looking for online, he almost threw up. Utterly disgusted, he dug into his pocket and threw some small packages of red powder to the ground. Staring at them as if they were a bomb, he looked at us wide eyed.  I looked up at Nick as well expecting some answers. 

“The Coven is a drug made from blood and bones of children harvested while they are still alive and mixed with other magic items. Three remains have been found discarded causing us to fully believe you are dealing the real product.” Nick said as he bent over to retrieve the bags that were tossed aside. 

The bags were tainted things. I didn’t want Nick to touch them but we couldn’t just leave them behind. Horrified over what he’d been a part of, Crocodile nearly lost it. Hands raised to the side of his head; he shook staring at the ground. 

“I didn’t know...” His voice was soft and full of regret. 

“We believe you.” I assured him hoping it helped even a little. 

He got himself collected enough to ask for a pen and paper to write down what he knew. To him, dealing drugs to adults who he thought should know better was acceptable. Harming children in the process simply was not. He could have justified his actions to a point. His hands shook as he silently wrote down what he knew. 

“I don’t understand why Piper would do this. He's lost a child so should know the pain it causes. To kill others that’s... I just don’t get it.” He said meekly no longer acting tough. 

Nick accepted the notebook and didn’t look over it just yet. He could tell there was more information to find out. 

“What happened to his child?” Nick pressed. 

Crocodile looked up, unaware of why it would help. Still, he went on. 

“We all lived in a small community of half breeds and some full breeds. When something was hunting us down, The Corporation arrived too late. His son died and he’s been trying to get back at you since. I assumed getting the money from this drug was a part of the plan. But it’s stupid, you know? No matter how much we earned we couldn’t do a dent to The Corporation. You all may be lacking agents but fight against something like that would mean you would need like...” 

“An army?” Nick finished. 

He figured out something we didn’t just. Slowly it all sank into Crocodiles head and he grew paler. I clued in as well. The drug turned humans into something else. Something supernatural that could be controlled by their addiction. Piper was trying to create his own fighting force for revenge. Horror over the truth sank down to my bones.  Crocodile whispered to himself feeling stupid he ever got used in such a way. 

“I’ll turn myself in. I played a part in this. I just wanted to make money; I didn’t want children to die...” He admitted knowing it didn’t redeem himself. 

“Your punishment should be minor due to you regret and help. We’ll vouch for the fact you were unaware of what was truly happening. I’ll also ensure your sister is taken care of.” Nick started. 

My partner pulled out some make up remover to try and get his face cleaned up. Then came out his phone to call in for backup. We needed more agents to take down this entire operation. There were far too many places to take care of on our own. Aside from Crocodile, at least two other dealers needed to be caught and their leader. With information and a good theory, some agents could be spared to help. They met us at the end of the alleyway within the hour. Two sets of partners I’ve never met before arrived, and a numbered agent to bring Crocodile in. Nick got the makeup off and they gave him a suit jacket. There no time for him to get fully changed. 

“What are we up against?” I asked as the other agents started to leave to take care of their tasks. 

They handed us some guns along with some odd looking magazines. The weapons looked normal, but they were magic stun guns. We were going against humans that were turned into something else against their will. Killing them was not the goal. Getting them treatment was ideal but I didn’t know what kind of treatment would be available.  

“With continual use, the Coven drug turns humans into something so much like Witches, they ended up being labeled as such. In fact, the first case we did was with a Witch that turned years ago. Even one dose is enough to change a human forever. We need to take them into a protected treatment program for their own good.” Nick said, the information leaving me shocked. 

We nearly died from one Witch and now we might be facing a small hoard of them? Somewhere in this city was an unknown number of Witches lurked in the dark. Nick gave me permission to call my sister. She needed to get out of town for a few days. My call didn’t go through causing me to nearly freak out. I left her a few messages. I wanted to drop the case and go to her. Finishing the case would be better.  

Our target turned out to be a warehouse where Crocodile picked up his products once a week. The other agents were to hunt down the rest of the dealers to break up the gang. A car was lent to us and Nick drove so I could keep trying to get through to my sister. I felt scared to death over not only what we would face but for my family living inside the city.

It was after that night, I continued to see the little girl wandering about the house. I was use to seeing all the spirits moving about or standing around and glaring, but this little girl seemed different. Every spirit I’ve ever come across always seems to wander. They walk as though they are lost. Always in a specific direction, but always confused, as though they had forgotten what they were doing or were unsure if they were going in the right direction. It makes them all the more unnerving when they finally snap. Most will lose control and thrash around violently, as they attempt to slam and smash everything around them. They begin to become monstrous in appearance for a brief moment as all of that deep-seated anger is released  from within. They writhe inhumanly as the air around them becomes polluted with a foul odor and occasionally the buildup of negative energy causes objects around them to react. Some might see this as a glass breaking or even a cold breeze across their body. They may smell the foul odor which may lead them to believe it’s a septic problem, but whatever they think is more pleasant than the reality.

For almost an entire week after the events of that night, it was peaceful. The ghosts made their usual rounds, but nothing out of the ordinary. The only thing that ever put me on edge, was the little girl. It was how she carried herself. She didn’t seem lost or confused. In fact, after that night, she never hid away. Almost as though she pranced about the house in bliss. It was unsettling to see a spirit behave this way and although every spirit had a keen interest in my girlfriend, this one took it upon herself, to speak to her. It wasn’t until the morning I came downstairs after a good night sleep. I heard whispering once again, only to find my girlfriend in the family room. As I rounded the corner, I noticed the whispering coming from the little girl. The little girls hand over her mouth, whispering into my girlfriends ear. I remembered the first night I saw her. At the time, I tho if he maybe I was overthinking it. Maybe nothing was out of the ordinary, but I couldn’t shake the feeling. 

That night my girlfriend and I got into bed and continued our conversation from downstairs about repainting the kitchen. The conversation went back and forth until we decided to pick it up the next morning. We shut off the light and curled up together. Then she asked me if I had ever thought about “putting a child” in her. This was completely out of character for her. We had only ever discussed children once and we had both decided it might be a bit too late, but the way she asked had me in shock. I was at a loss for words. I asked her if she had changed her mind since we originally spoke about it. She told me over the last two weeks, she had decided to change her mind. 

We continued discussing it into the night and I shared my concerns and she attempted to put them to rest. About an hour in, we were at a bit of a standstill until I felt a cold chill run down my spine and a shock of cold on my ribs. My hand reached over to feel my side. It felt frozen and my head shot over to see a hand wrapped around me. I didn’t want to turn to see who it would be, but as the otherworldly laughter filled my ears, I knew it was the little girl. She leaned in closer and I could swear I felt her long dark hair against the back of my neck. She began whispering in my ear, but whatever she was saying, it might as well have been in another language. It was as though she was speaking in consonants. Before I knew it, she was gone and I was seeing things from my girlfriends perspective. 

That night I had a terrible nightmare. I was lying in bed and the room was empty aside from the bed. My girlfriend was absent and eyes attached to shadows flooded the room. It felt as though the room was growing smaller while the bedroom door in front of me stayed the same size. I knock rang from the door as a weak voice came from behind it. The knocks became louder as the voice became more clear. It was my girlfriend asking to be let inside. I told her the door wasn’t locked and the voice continued asking to be let in. As I sat forward to get up, I felt a tussle in the sheets as my girlfriend sprang from the covers and asked who it was. I was terrified and eventually the knocking turned to violent banging and voice from the other side began shouting to be let in. It was at this point the voice became distorted and disturbing. It was as though I was listening to a cassette as the tape was being ripped out violently. Everything was happening so fast, I didn’t even noticed the eyes swarming me as my girlfriend approached the door. I screamed and begged for her to leave it closed but she ignored me. As she twisted the handle, I woke up in a panicked sweat. 

I was breathing uncontrollably and I felt like there was a knot my stomach that I had to vomit up to get rid of. My girlfriend was already up and starting her day. I shifted to the edge of the bed and planted my feet on the floor. Out of the corner of my eye, I could see something on the floor in front of the door. I turned to find my girlfriend passed out on the bedroom floor. I couldn’t help but wonder how much of that nightmare could be real.

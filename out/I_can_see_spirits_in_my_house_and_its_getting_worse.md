This is a true story about me and it freaks me out. Im a teenager living in a pretty big house and ever since we moved here when i was in 6th grade, there has been more than one presence. 

For context about why i see them, i have a “gift from God” is what my grandma calls it, where since i was little , maybe 5-6 years old, I’ve been able to see spirits and recently, about a few months recent, i can hear them. 

Back to when we moved in, one of the first nights i slept in the house there was a man in a top hat and trench coat that would stand in front of my door at night and he would creek the door open. One day i saw him standing in my room when i randomly woke up late at night from my sleep. i was horrified but i somehow got the courage to tell him to “Get out you don’t belong here, this is my house!” and he hasn’t been seen since then. I don’t see him, but i feel him still lingering around occasionally. He doesn’t like that i live here. 

A year later, i got sleep paralysis. i could only move my fingers and i could barley open my eyes. It felt like they were being held shut by.. something. it’s the most terrifying feeling ever. there was a woman standing in a torn up wedding dress in my room. i was oddly calm and just shut my eyes but when i opened them again i could move again and she was gone. When i fully woke up the next morning for school, i was brushing my teeth and when i bent down to spit out the toothpaste, i looked in the mirror while my head was partially down and the same woman was standing directly behind me, not even a foot away from me. i whipped my head around and dropped my toothbrush, but she was gone. I haven’t seen her since.

It’s been a little over a year since that happened and it’s gotten to a point where i can see spirits attached to people and their auras. about a month ago-ish i started experiencing an intense feeling that someone new was attached to me and my room. I named her lillian and she won’t cause me harm, but she doesn’t want me living there. she is attached to me and follows me to other places too. Wherever i go..she goes. i don’t know what she looks like but i have an idea. brown hair, pretty eyes, and medium height and that’s all. Anyways, i always hear “hey”, “maddie”, “look here”, etc. I never told anyone until i was home alone with my dog one night and i heard “get out…now!” and i was like oh hell no. That’s when i called my grandma and me, her, and my pap blessed the house over the phone.

That was about a week ago. I still hear whispering and i see her. i’m scared of her now more than ever after last nights events.

My mom left for a business trip which left me in charge of my sister and dog until friday (she left monday). Last night i was sleeping in the same bed as my sister because my mom usually sleeps with her so i was downstairs in her room. i was just relaxing on my phone but she was already asleep. It sounded like she was directly next to my ear in like a low talking/whispering voice, “you need to leave.” and then a figure stood in the room. i about shit myself and i turned on the light which was luckily right by the bed so i didn’t have to get up. It left the room. but she was outside of the door just, hovering there. i could sense her. she knew that i knew she was there and she didn’t plan on leaving. i said “in the blood of jesus you are not to go near me or my family!” not long after that she was gone and i fell asleep from pure exhaustion, not because i wanted to.

I called my grandma in the morning and she is planning on anointing the house with oil. we have tried everything. absolutely everything. nothing has gotten this lady out of my house and it’s not like she wants to leave. she’s gonna put up a fight. i posted this story to see if anyone could help me out, or give advice. I’m terrified to sleep at night, and i think she has some friends. They are everywhere in my house. I see things and hear things. i wish i never was given this “gift.” Please help.

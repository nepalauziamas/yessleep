I hopped onto a late night flight from Los Angeles To California, as takeoff passed I moved my seat back and stretched out ready to fall asleep. When I woke up it felt like I had slept for a couple of hours. I looked at my phone to see that is was 2:06 AM which made me figure that it wouldn’t be too long until we landed. But as I looked out the window next to me, I found out we were still flying over water. As I had just woke up, I thought that I was just seeing things, as I was disoriented.

As I hit the button to call a flight attendant, the flight attendant came over. I asked her how long it would be until landing. She had a big smile on her face, which I found weird. As if what was going on already wasn’t weird enough, The girl said it would be about an hour, which made no sense as we were still flying over water.

As I calmed myself down, I looked at my phone, 2:06 blinked back at me. I thought to myself, “How could it still possibly be 2:06? It must’ve took at least a minute before the flight attendant came over to my seat.”

I pulled out my tablet and saw it too displayed 2:06 AM. I started a clock on my tablet and spent  the next couple hours looking back at it every once in a while waiting for it to change.

it never changed.

I asked a women sitting to the row next to me, she looked across saying “yes? Sir?”
I asked “Do you know how long until we land?” She narrowed her eyes. “That flight attendant just said it would be about an hour.”

I shook my head in confusion. “She said that 2 hours ago, we should’ve landed by now!” She stared down at me as If I was crazy.

The next couple hours went by, The attendants served every hour a serving for everyone.
As I was trying to calm myself down, a young girl that was one of the flight attendants came down the isle and kneeled now by me, She asked if I had been experiencing being stuck in time too. I replayed “Yes, are you too?” she responded saying “Something is going on, look what I found on my phone.” She showed me her phone showing a Wikipedia page showing information on a flight with the code MU5765.” The page showed that it had gone missing. I then realized that the flight code on the Wikipedia page was the same as the flight I was on.”

As the hours passed I couldn’t bare it anymore. I couldn’t stand eating the same perfect meal for so long. In a fit of rage I threw my phone and tablet on the ground causing it to shatter and break.

I felt that the only way to stop this suffering was to jump out of the plane. as I crawled to the front of the plane I realized that the flight attendants were no longer there. I thought it would be hard to open the door as the force would be to much on it. but surprisingly it opened very easily.

As I jumped in the water of the black sky it all went black. As I impacted the water I realized that I was back in my seat. I started screaming “NO! NO! NO!” As a flight attendant came over I realized that the girl was no longer smiling with that wide grin.

I asked the flight attendant “What time is it?” The girl said that is was 2:09 AM” I pulled out my phone to confirm that she was correct and too it read 2:09 AM. I looked out the window beside me to see the lights of the city. I am now at a bar posting this.

I am writing and posting this before it is too late, I have about an hour before it's my turn to go. Jean went there yesterday and now he pretends like nothing happened like our best friend  Jack wasn't killed three days ago. Just like his family, their son disappeared and they don't even try to learn the truth. Disappeared…  he didn't disappear, he was killed by them. I asked Jean and he just said that it's better not to think of it. That son of a b*tch not to think about how our best friend was shredded to pieces? We should have stayed inside, it  was just one day one day and we would have been out of here. Jack wanted to see what was outside for his last birthday in this town. Ever since I was little I remember that day. Every year no one even thought of going out at night. My mother would make me  come inside earlier and close all the doors and windows. Every time anyone tryed to ask an adult they wouldn't answer and just say to stay indoors. To my knowledge only one person ever disappeared even though some say they were more .

 

I was a kid back then the only thing that they said to us was that he had a car accident. I was young but I remember that guy. He would frequently walk around with a bottle on his hand. I learned earlier that he started drinking after the death of his child. That day he had an argument with his wife and crashed on an alleyway. But I knew the truth. I heard my parents talking about how his car had claw marks and how his door was torn out. I never believed it though some superstition, some rumor. That's why I agreed to their plan, they were trying to get me to agree for a whole month. Sometimes I try to think that I didn't agree that I told them that it was crazy. It was Jack's idea that we usually celebrated his birthday a day earlier but he would have a splitting headache. So Jean would bring him some pain killers from his dad's chemistry along with some pills that they usually give to people with insomnia. 


After everyone was asleep we would go out. It worked! and so we went to the park of our town. Every store was closed that day. Everyone believes  that nonsense, said Jack. We parked our car at a parking spot nearby and made our way towards the park. About two hours passed, we laughed and talked about the future, about college, about our careers. As time passed we decided that we had enough maybe it was a stupid myth or something. Just when we were about to enter the car we heard something. A low sobbing sound, is someone crying? Jean asked. Why would anyone even be here? We should get out of here before they find out about us, I said Jean seemed to agree but Jack… Jack had other plans he started following the sound. Carefully avoiding every leaf or branch even when it was so dark we followed him. 


I think of this moment non- stop since then. If I had insisted that we should leave if I had forced them to leave, maybe he would still be alive. We continued walking until we reached someone , something was crouched down on the grass holding his stomach and sobbing. Right from the start  the way it stood and moved back and forth, the way it sobed and the fact that it didn't acknowledge us even though we weren't trying to conceal our footsteps anymore made it seem like it wanted us to come closer. Jean spoke up "hey dude are you alright" no response jack spoke next " man do you need help"  still no response. Jean got closer, jack asked "is he injured" "I can't tell it's too dark" responded Jean. It was then that we heard Jean scream The thing started dragging him toward the back of the park where the already scarce moonlight disappeared we ran and grabbed his hand. 


We tried to pull him back, the creature was strong. Jean kicked it as many times as he could. We managed to free him and started running towards the car. Jean's left leg was bleeding, he breathed heavily, I helped him walk the creature was right behind us. Jack grabbed a rock and throwed it. I heard it making impact the creature screeched with anger, stopping for just a few seconds. I opened the door to the car and helped Jean get inside, I looked at Jack he had almost made it,  moonlight illuminated a smile on his face. Then another creature jumped in front of him. At first I thought that a cloud was covering the moon as it appeared it was human like, his skin  completely  back it's mouth was open revealing it's knife like teeth. Jack didn't even notice until it dug it's claws into his throat. A weak scream was all that he could manage before  he was brought to the ground. 


Jean screamed and tried to get to jack I held him. He told to let him go but I didnt I just stood there petrified as my friend was being devoured. The first creature tried to feast as well only for the second one to grab it's hand and snap it without the slightest hint of difficulty. The worst thing isn't that though no the worst part was the fact that the broken arm just bent back into shape again in a few seconds. I forced Jean inside and drove away. The creature followed us,grabbing the car several times leaving claw marks everywhere. Until we reached my home the creature stopped at the edge of the road screaming with anger at me. It didn't even touch the sidewalk. My parents weren't angry they just looked at me, their eyes full of fear. They didn't answer my questions the police came and took my and jeans report and told us to go to the station. So that brings us to today. 


I don't know what they are going to tell me as I don't know why I am writing this is it because I feel guilty that I abandoned him there or what . In the official report they wrote about an animal attack no one believed it they all knew what happened. It's time to go now I won't name my town but if you are ever told to stay inside that day just do it.

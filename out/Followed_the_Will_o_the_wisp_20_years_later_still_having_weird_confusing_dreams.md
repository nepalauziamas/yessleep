I grew up in Louisiana on the water.  We lived so far out I was homeschooled so I'd go wondering through the swamp on mud trails and floating plank walking paths. I'd camp out in old machinery people had brought out unwisely and it sunk half way into the muck. It was great fun and I never considered it spooky at the time. I was 8 or 9 at the time so I knew to avoid the water as the sun comes and goes (feeding time for the gators) and how to avoid other dangers like snakes or sink holes of red clay that would hold you tight, but I suppose there were so many other dangers to warn a adventurous boy of some thing will inevitably left out for me to figure out on my own. 

I witnessed the will o' the wisps, or as some of my family called them the jack o lantern, some believe they're sent from somewhere else to mislead and others try to say it's swamp gas or fireflies but either way they dance and hypnotize if you're not careful and the one time I followed them before I knew better I  mindlessly walked for nearly two hours deeper into the swamp cutting myself a path with my machete. I was drawn to a massive peaked hill with a couple shrubs but mostly just moss covered which was very uncommon for that area, no mounds or peaks, just small hills that stuck out of the water that formed a bit of a dry walking path, swamp, trees, moss, and various animals. The area was mostly clear a few feet from the hill like nothing wanted to grow there. It had to be a natural development or done by hand as the brush was old and thick. Someone would have a hard time getting a four wheeler back to this location with how wet the ground is and how thick the brush was and how close the trees were. 

I hung out at that peak for at least another hour or two just inspecting it for whatever reason. It was 20 or 30 feet wide at the base and stood 15 to 20 feet tall like a tilted rounded side pyramid.  There was no building around or tracks aside from deer, goats, ducks and such. 

I didn't even think to go back home at all til a rottweiler stray I had befriended came pounding after me barking and it snapped me out of just being content there ignoring my hunger and my thirst. My dog friend stayed with me til I got within a mile of my house and went his own way. He disappeared a couple months later and never returned. He was only 3 or 4 and in good health, well fed and all. 

I was around 8 or 9 at the time (it was the early 90s parenting was different) and now into my 30s I sometimes wake up dreaming about that hill, but there is a zombified goat half way up the hill. It is missing patches of flesh and you can see the bones, it looks like it was buried at one point and unearthed. It's mouth stuffed with old rags, shirts, jeans and things. Just full on gagged. I start pulling these rags from its thinking I need to help this animal. I ungag the goat and it let's out a very dry sigh and says something in a human tone I can never remember when I wake. But it has been a reoccurring dream throughout my life since that day. 

That has to be my weirdest experience, besides being pulled under by something in the swamp whilst swimming with friends, but that could have been anything with all the predators in the swamp, I'm just glad it didn't take a bite.

If you're reading this, please, don't play the game Invocation!  Excuse any typos, I'm struggling to write this because my hands won't stop shaking. 

My friend Danny received an email from an unknown game publisher called Exitium games. They gave him early access to play their latest game, Invocation. I told him to be careful downloading free games from unknown publishers because they could have a virus. But he said he had a VPN and solid anti-virus software so he wasn't worried about it.

The game started like a typical horror game. You avoid a monster and solve puzzles in an abandoned school, but then the game changed. 

Later on in the game, he went into a room, and he wound up outside an appartment building. It was the apartment him and his mom lived in when he was a kid, before she died. He went up to their apartment, and the door was open like it was waiting for him. He went into the living room, and he saw his dead mom lying on the floor with a plastic bag over her head. 

He tried to delete the game, but it wouldn't let him. He even tried opening task manager to close it and the game wouldn't close. He shut his laptop and he called me immediately. After telling me about the game, he went quiet. I heard something in his voice I've never heard before. He was fucking terrified. 

He said that the thing on the floor wasn't his mom. It was something else. He said that the body stood up, and it bent backwards. It pulled the plastic bag off and showed its face. He said it's skin was like tar, and it's eyes were white. It had no nose, and it's face was upside down.

I eventually got him to calm down, or so I thought. I went to bed, and that night I had a nightmare. It was the worst nightmare I've ever had. I dont usually get bothered by bad dreams, but this one felt real, and it felt like it would never end. 

In my nightmare, I was in this old house, like a condemed two story house. It had this smell, like strong cinnamon mixed with metal. The walls were covered in writing that I couldn't make out. Danny was in the house, and I tried to talk to him but he wouldn't listen. He just stood there still, staring down the hallway. He started walking, and I followed him.  

I followed Danny downstairs, into the basement. The smell was ubearable down there. He stopped in front of this huge furnace. As I got closer to him, I heard this deep awful voice. It was like broken record repeating something that sounded like "finis to some." It didn't make sense, but I got a terrible feeling from it. 

When I got about a couple feet away from Danny, he slowly turned around. His face was upside down, smiling at me as he spoke the words, "finis to some." If anyone has any idea what that means, please let me know.

I woke up feeling like there was a rock in my stomach. I tried to get ahold of Danny, but he wouldnt respond to my texts or calls. His dad called me crying yesterday, and he told me that Danny had jumped off the roof of their building.

 I asked him if Danny left a note or anything that said why he did it. His dad said he checked his room, and his laptop, but he couldn't do anything on it cause it was frozen on a screen that said, "Ending 1 of 3". 

I know this sounds insane, and no one will probably beleive me. But I think that game killed my friend. I'm not superstitious. I never believed in demons, but I think something evil was attatched to that game. So please, if you get invited to play it, DON'T.

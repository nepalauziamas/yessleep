Hello again, this is Hermann.

&#x200B;

In order to remember my story that I have posted last days, I give you the link: [https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/wruevk/be\_careful\_on\_prostitutes\_in\_bucharest\_they\_might/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/wruevk/be_careful_on_prostitutes_in_bucharest_they_might/)

&#x200B;

You guys shall not believe what happened. I have got your feedback on my ideas, thank you for all of that. I was contacted by some of you in private, one of them is a journalist, she wants to be called Ruxandra. She wanted an interview with me, to share it on her blog. She said she believed me, that she has some experience on this things. I was reluctant on first, but she seemed to insist in meeting me. I thought that she may have a reason for it, so I finally accepted to meet her in the Cișmigiu park, in central Bucharest. I had been released from the hospital and I was able, using crouches, to get there.

&#x200B;

She is  delightful girl, former news reporter, today being an independent journalist. She was kind and understanding, she listened carefully on all I said, assured me of her discretion. She knew a lot of local folklore, we ended up talking much on my thesis, my experience and my view. I told her that I want to go back and meet the Forest Girl, that my life now, without having contact with this reality, only studying it, would become really dry, as I told some of you in comment section already. She tried, gently, to persuade me to give up on the quest, that these realities are really dangerous, a lot of unknown, that I am still young, that I can do so many yet with my life. That I can show others the wonders of that world by my academic life. I was undisturbed by what she said, even if I really understood (at least I thought I did) why she was telling me all that. She thanked me for the interview and stated that she will contact me later, for feedback on the draft, before publishing it. I thank her too and went back to the rented apartment.

&#x200B;

She called me two days later, that she wanted to meet me again. Fortunately, I see to be walking already easier, only with some temporary, medical, prosthetics, no crouches. It was already close to night fall, she said that she is willing to help and go with me in search of these beings. I was surprised, but glad, and I accepted it. Robert agreed to drive to that area, even if he disliked the idea and told me I was horny...

&#x200B;

We met at the edge of the forest, in the opposite sense of the place it all happened. Ruxandra parked her car in some distance, then she came to me with a very serious expression. She got her phone in her hand. She said: ”You know, I had a very serious discussion with some friends of mine on you and on your situation. We shall offer you a chance to get what you want. Even for me it is pretty unknown and dangerous what shall we do but a friend of mine read your testimony and she wants to make a contact herself. This is why I called you. We shall do it with, or without you. We shall not stop you, if you want to come with us, but I shall give you a warning. One chance to back off. If we go on from this moment on, it will be no way back. You can still go back on your old life. But, if we proceed, there is no way back. So, what will it be?”

&#x200B;

”Already there is no way back.” I said without even thinking. Ruxandra give a sigh and said: ”Alright. So be it.” she replied, almost whispering. She handled her phone and gave to read a series of posts on her blog.

&#x200B;

I gave you the link to the first post [https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/vzxear/helena\_of\_obor\_part\_1/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/vzxear/helena_of_obor_part_1/)

&#x200B;

I could not believe what I read. I do not want to spoil the story for you, she befriended a vampire lady, who was born in 1912, been a terror for Bucharest up the late 1930ties, when she went to hibernation until recently. She is a special, rare type of vampire. I let you know her on Ruxandra„s story. What I dare to say now is that the story confirmed the presence of un-human beings in Bucharest up to the 1930ties the least.

&#x200B;

Ruxandra said after I finished reading: ”I shall not lie to you now. You could die. I could die. We are doing something we are not even sure it shall work. We know that there were several recent victims, I still got my connection at the Medical Examiner Institute of Bucharest, from the times I worked at the TV network, there appear to be several victims in the recent month. You shall not see it in the news, but I managed to find out. The coroners do not understand, they have no clue. She is hunting. We do not know why. Maybe it is just a phase, then she will go into hibernation. But we do not know, she may continue. Who knows how many will die? She needs to be stopped. You were seconds away from death, you would have been just a extra page on a file at the morgue.” Ruxandra checked that my phone was closed and I have no recording or transmission devices on me.

&#x200B;

We walked towards the car and I was about to meet her friend, as I already suspected who she was. As we came close to the car, in the dusk, a strange fear came over me, like a warning sign from my  subconscious, that something very dangerous is getting closer. I knew why, Ruxandra wrote about that sensation of dread. In a way, I was already about to fulfill my desire to meet a supernatural being very close, regardless if meeting the Forest Girl and the Night Man shall succeed. As we so the car, Ruxandra told me to step back and wait. She went to the car and let Helena came out.

&#x200B;

My heart shrunk when I so her. Imagine a dead witch, dressed in a long black victorian dress, a little embalmed, with open white eyes and very dark clown makeup on. She seemed to be a part of a nightmare no horror movie could represent. Probably, if my legs were fine, I would have ran away immediately , without even thinking, regardless of what I read, what Ruxandra said and the reason I was came there. I did not even care to ”man up” in front of Ruxandra, I begun to shake out of fear.

&#x200B;

Ruxandra smiled: ”It is ok, even to me she still gives me the creeps. Beings like her bring this reaction in mortals. It is an instinct.” Yes, it is. She gentle pushed towards Helena, as my fear grew. I followed, although I felt unreal, like in a dream when you do absurd things, even if your rationality is still there and tells you they are absurd things. Helena had a sharp, but curios look on me. I felt like closing my eyes not see her eyes anymore. How do you get properly introduced to a vampire? Shake hands? Say ”How do you do?” Then I had a thought, she is an ”old school” lady, from the 1930ties, so I approached her hand, took her and kissed it. My body started to tremble hard, as I touched that cadaver-like, cold and stone-hard hand, especially when I kissed it. Things got a little better after I let it down and rose up, to look in her eyes. She had a quirk smile and said in her sharp, hissed voice: ”I see that I can show respect to a lady. Yet, you went to pay a woman to give her body to you. For me, a man who goes to prostitutes can not feel no respect for women after this.”

&#x200B;

Of course that made me tremble again, I did not knew what to say, then I remembered what Ruxandra wrote: ”You are probably right.” She looked at me again and continued: ”She could have finished you out very easily. You have no idea what she is capable of. Of course, you do not know what I am capable of either. But this is probably better for you.” She looked at Ruxandra, who smiled weirdly. This layer of reality I have got myself into gets even more interesting. Ruxandra herself seems to look a little weird in attitude now. Or maybe I was getting mad.

&#x200B;

Do not get wrong, Helena is no hag. In a way, she looks like a woman in her early 30ties. Her dress was not fully victorian, the neck and the chest were free, also her black hair was only a little braided, almost completely free, with some little, discrete jewels, into the braids. She was wearing a corset or the dress had a discreet corset-like effect. As I look back upon it now, she had her own sense of style, I have to admit.

&#x200B;

Helena continued: ”Something important I need to state. All this can be fatal to you, I am pretty strong and resourceful myself, but she is too. In fact, there can be more of them, even if this is unlikely. I advice both of you to do exactly what I say. My opinions and decisions are not failproof, but they are your best chance. If I say to stick close to me, you do it. If I say to back off slowly, you do it. If I say run or whatever, you do it. Got it?” I nod my head. If she said that, it made think things are far more serious then I ever expected to be.” She continued: ”I saw that your readers advice you to get a flamethrower. Unfortunately, we can not get something like that. Neither guns, as the laws in here make it very difficult to get them in this country. I had some guns taken from the police back in day, but I lost them, as you can probably imagine. For now, the best we can do is to improvise some torches. We have brought same materials.”

&#x200B;

Ruxandra went to the car and got them out the trunk. There were some pieces of wood already there (I wonder why they got them, if they got them from the woods, anyway...), some gauze and fire accelerator in bottles. Ruxandra started to make them, Helena joined. I did my best to help them, not just due to manners, but also because I was afraid of Helena. I said: ”Better let me do it. I have a lot of experience on those things, on my field trips. Some metallic nails would have been helpful now. My advice is to get some new woods from the forest, better ones.” Helena replied: ”It is best to avoid this. We do not know if that will trigger something.” I thought to myself: This sounds worse and worse. What can be in that forest so that we need to avoid this? I tried to remember something buried inside my head, something that sounded similar and really scary, but I could not remember what. But I was ”living my dream”, so I went on as she said.

&#x200B;

There were not the best torches I could make, but I think it was better then nothing. Helena added, when it was done: ”Keep them in your hands. And the lighters available. But do not light them up, no need to premature, useless provocation.” After all was done, we went inside the edge of the forest. Helena signaled us to enter, then she followed and stopped us. Ruxandra signaled me to be silent, as Helena rose her hands in the air and something I did not expect, but that I have read about, happened. Helena started to emanate something indescribable, especially from her hands. Something harsh, cold and strong. Slowly, a grey mist came upon us, then it started to extend inside the forest. I felt bad, cold, but also, in a weird way, energizing. I felt like it came from another place and another time, I felt like I was in England or in Scotland, in late autumn, in a cemetery or, at least, in the yard of a haunted mansion or castle. This feeling was very strong. But not in normal conditions, it was like in a story or a legend from there. Indeed, Helena was really resourceful.

&#x200B;

I dared to ask Helena: ”I feel like in Britain. I wonder why?” Helena smiled in one of her weird ways and replied: ”In a way, I am of British descent. On a Human level, I am of Romanian and Romani ancestors. On the other level, lets call it supernatural or vampiric level, I am clearly pretty British. The beings closest to me on this aspect are from there, no one remotely similar to me in the country or this area of Europe. At least not from the old peoples, anyway, today there might be some. I do not know.”  Curiosity got the best of me: ”I guess you are different from most vampires.” She replied: ”You are right. Those like me are different from most vampires you could met out there, although I am, pretty much, more a western vampire than a local strigoi.” I continued: ”How are your kind called? Apart from the other vampires?” She said: ”We call ourselves Clowns. Just like that. Honestly, I do not know how other vampires would call us now. We drink blood, but we mostly feed from the fear, suffering and cruel death of our victims, we take their energy, their life like that. Although I admit drank a lot of actual human blood in certain difficult periods.”

&#x200B;

Night was already here. She let her hands down. She was even more scary now. But I was getting use to this, in strange way. Then I asked: ”What is Ramona? What is a Forest Girl? What is an Alder Girl?” Helena smiled and gave a small sigh: ”They are a race of ancient beings. They take care of nature, especially forests. They did a work somewhat similar, more complementary to that of Elves. They were in far better terms with Humans a very, very long time ago, it seems. But, as Humans started to destroy forests, to expand in population and civilization, they started to hate them more and more. What exactly they are as their nature, I myself know too little, as a matter of fact. The Elves knew much better, but I was never close to them, to be able to ask.” I replied: ”Are there any Elves in this city now?” Helena answered: ”Since I have awaken, I never met of felt one clearly. But, as far I know Elves, there are, probably, a least a few in the city.”

&#x200B;

We started to do our walk. First of all, let me say a few things about he Băneasa forest of Bucharest. It is the largest forest patch just to the northern edge of Bucharest, a remnant of a very large forest that used to cover the south of Romania. It is, virtually, like a large, un-arranged, park in the suburbs of the city. The dominant tree type use to be the oak. Yet today, the forest has lots of new trees, of several different types. Citizens of Bucharest often go to barbecues and such in here, a lot of small, unkempt, paths (unfortunately, there is still the occasional trash in the forest floor), the Bucharest city zoo is located inside the forest. So do not imagine anything big or very wild, there are very few wild animals. I wonder if we ever stumble upon people in here, perhaps Helena„s mist is meant to protect us against that as well.

&#x200B;

I have asked: ”Why didn„t we just go to the house she took me into?” Ruxandra replied: ”Think about it for a little. If you were in either of those two shoes, after you had a human escaping from there, would you stay in the immediate future? Probably not. Yet, Helena thinks they could not be far, they may have a different house around here or else.” And then smiled and winked: ”I trust Helena will sniff them out.” Helena looked as us: ”I already sniffed her. But I need you two to talk a little less, in order to be able to work easily.” Fair enough, I said to myself. I was carrying two torches, Ruxandra one. Helena had her two bayonets at the waist and walked slowly and carefully. It was dark, as I looked into the sky and only a few stars. A phenomenon clear to understand, since the city, illuminated mostly with yellow, strong sodium bulbs, has a strong light pollution and that makes stars mostly invisible from ground level. Whoever switches back and forth from city to wilderness realizes that pretty easily. So, because the city had a powerful public street light system, the forest around us was in more darkness.

&#x200B;

The ”gothic magic” bubble Helena kept us soon started to stop being the only ”magic” I felt. Slowly, something was coming, especially from the outside of it, partially from inside of it. As time passed, it kept going stronger. It was different from what Helena did, perhaps not stronger per se, but deeper, in a way, hard to describe. I felt a tint that something was deeply displeased of what we were doing and felt an anxiety that started to grow, different from the one the presence of Helena brought. Helena was a danger herself, this is how I still felt,  of course, but a constant one and now I did not felt her as hostile or angry, but the other ”energy” was getting more and more hostile and angry. Until something unexpected happened.

&#x200B;

My undamaged foot get caught up in a root, but being caught up was not a good term for what I felt. I felt the root moved on its own and tried to bring me down. My instincts and my experience did not failed me, I was able to make myself land on the undamaged leg and keep the damaged ankle from not touching down.  Ruxandra came out fast to see if I was hurt, she helped me got up. I was not a rough fall, the forest floor made it easier, I had many of those in the wilderness. If it was on pavement, it would have been much rough.

&#x200B;

When I was up, I saw Helena looking sharply at us and said: ”We need to put on the torches. They are playing it that way.” I put on each torch, one by one, carefully. I showed Ruxandra a little how to handle it, in order to avoid injury or to set the forest on fire accidentally. I kept on thinking that there could be many beings, like living trees from legends, in this forest. Almost any tree could be something. So I asked: ”How many do you think they are?” Helena replied: ”Most likely there are only the two you met, nobody of her kind. They may be others, but not many. But keep in mind those beings can do a lot of things, they can make us feel that they are much more of them then they actually are. Yet, even if she is alone or only a few, they can make it as if they were much many, I guess.”

&#x200B;

”That is reassuring.” I replied. Helena said: ”Would you like to get back? To leave? We can escort you back.” ”No, no way.” I said. Ruxandra added: ”Me neither, I want to go on with it.” ”So be it. Let„s go then.” replied and Helena and she went, as we followed. After a few minutes, something else happened. A branch hit Ruxandra on the back, she was startled, but she did not scream of fell. I went to her, then the same branch hit me as well. This was getting serious, I said. Helena looked angry at the branch, being scary for me as well, went to tree and, in a matter of seconds, she took the branch that was not very thin and broke it. The tree gave a strong squishy sound and backed away. I admit I was startled at this. Helena had a fire-like expression in her white eyes, as she hissed to the tree: ”Don„t you dare! I can destroy you in a blink of an eye!” The tree stood still, but the trees around started like to move and emanate something. Branches above us started to move gently, without wind. I do not remember seeing this in the wilderness, but I think I felt something similar two or tree times, less intense.

&#x200B;

Helena turned to us: ”Stay close to me and keep the torches as best as you can. I am sure she knows we are here, she knows that I am here. In her domain.” I took a deep breath, trying to brace myself. I looked at Ruxandra, she did her best to be strong, but I could feel anxiety growing silently inside of her. The rustle on the branches above us worried me the most. I also remembered I read that trees in the forest communicate also using fungi systems using their root system. Perhaps something similar was in here, but using some magic. Something could be working against us both from above and underneath us. Was I getting paranoid? Probably not, unfortunately.

&#x200B;

As we were getting deeper and deeper in the forest, me or Ruxandra got some bad touches from the trees, but nothing too serious. Helena went to trees each time she broke something on the tree or cut something from it, swiftly. Tension around us was building us. The mist kept the visibility pretty much. The feel of the forms of magic made me feel somewhat, surreal, if that makes sense. If I felt only one of them, it would not have felt so unreal.

&#x200B;

At some point, we reached small clearing. The trees were neither too young, or too old. Helena signaled us to stop. She suggested that we try to fix the torches in the ground and sit on the ground, close to each other, in silence. There was little or no wind. Yet, the branches were slowly moving above us. I did not dared to speak to much, and waited. As we sit there silently, in the mist, the branches decreased in movement. I kept looking above, the canopy was getting, slowly, darker. I was afraid of paranoia, so I broke the silence, still looking up: ”Is it me or it is getting darker?”

&#x200B;

Ruxandra looked up and said almost whispering: ”It is. Branches are coming close, together.” Helena added, with one her smiles: ”She is doing it. I am curious how long would this last.” ”How come” I asked. ”Can she sense us, hear us?” Helena looked with an ironic smile and being, probably unintentionally, scary for me: ”Oh yeah. I am sure she hears every single thing. She is close. Close then either of you realize.” Something inside of me arose. Helena continued: ”You may be impatient. I know how it is to be impatient.” She looked up, then around. ”She is playing with us. I wonder what she is thinking. Perhaps she will tell us herself.”

&#x200B;

Something was building up around us. I can not tell what. Rustle in the branches started again to get stronger. Helena got eventually, but Helena signaled us to stay down. She touched the knives on the belt and looked up.

&#x200B;

She added, like talking to herself: ”You know, there have always been women who sold their bodies due to despair. Myself think that, at least most of the times, there is always an alternative. Men who buy their services are guilty, indeed, I think they deserve to be punished first, not the women who do that work. Yet, women have their faults as well. In your country, in Germany, I was told you can find Romanian prostitutes everywhere, in every city. If one decide to renounce her dignity as a lady, her dignity as a person, she may find herrself going deeper and deeper into the mud. There are some women, always have been, who liked doing it. Some even consider it, especially nowadays, it seems, empowering. Now is worse then back in the day, I guess this is building up, as time passes. I see women going out public and some of them seem to have little to no self respect in how they present themselves. How do they expect for men to respect them then? Do not get me wrong, this is true about men as well.”

&#x200B;

She stopped for a few seconds, looked around, then turned to us and continued: ”She feeds on men, when she does what she does to them. I do not know how much she actually needs to feed. I do not know if the Night Man steps in when she is doing it or when she is doing it too much. But my guess is that she does not need it too much, at least. Old stories show that she likes it. She likes it a lot. This is what I think. Indeed, she is a whore? She may a wood whore, but a whore, nonetheless.”

&#x200B;

I guess this was the last drop. A wind started to blow in circles and started to build up pretty fast. Helena commanded: ”Watch the torches! Do your best to keep them running!” Ruxandra and I started to protect the fire from the wind, one torch went out, we took the lighters out and tried to rekindle them. Even if I was busy, I so my fears coming true at an even higher level then they were in my mind: The trees started to move and united into some sort of wall. They emitted some strange noises, like screeches. They were trying their best to keep us trapped. Ruxandra was doing her best to not to panic. I was starting to freak out as well, I think we tried to keep or minds busy with the torches, in order to stop the fear from taking over.

&#x200B;

One tree was not joining the rest. It stayed in place. The branches was moving and it was twisting, but stayed there. It was not very tall, for a tree, it had some twisted parts on the trunk. It moved in such way so that a face was getting visible on the upper part of the trunk and two branches started to look like arms. Soon, I begun to see and recognize not just the face, but the weed hair I so up close a few days ago. Even if it was pretty dark.

&#x200B;

The tree emitted a deep screech similar to the one I heard in that house, but much loader.  Helena stood still in her own ways, until she decided to shout sharply, but calmly to the creature: ”We shall talk in English, as people. This is how it is polite to communicate, in a way that all those present understand.” She raised her hands in the air and started to do some gestures towards the tree woman. The creature started to twisted and screech even loader, like it turned into a scream that was a manifestation of both pain and of anger. The wind changed sense perpetually, chaotically, the trees from the circle tried to came closer to us.

&#x200B;

The torches went out at this point. Me and Ruxandra ran towards Helena and fell to the ground, near her feet. I felt the safest place. She screamed, still sounding calm and terrifying at the same time: ”We can go on and on like until one of us gets down. Of both of us can go down. But we could just talk, you know... Like civilized people, you know... Perhaps you are not capable of this. What you do now shows me you are not. So, prove me wrong!”

&#x200B;

This being said, things calmed down, gradually, the trees returned and formed a circle, united. The creature stopped screeching, like she was calming down or forced herself to be calm. The shape started to change. In silence, she turned, gradually, in a very beautiful woman, very tall, with very long, black hair, wearing a white, long dress. She looked at us like she was wondering on something, with her mouth slightly open. I felt a strong desire for her, a strong attraction, as this beauty did not looked Human. Actually, she looked very much how an Elf woman was suppose to look, it seems. Then, this stage went by and she changed shape again, turning, slowly in the prostitute I picked up a few days ago. She became shorter in height, pretty average human height, the same face I remembered, the same hair dyed black, the eyelash extensions, the pumped up lips, she even had the same long, sharp, acrylic, pink nails. The clothes were different, though, she had a shirt that covered more of the torso, long jeans and sneakers. She looked filed with hate and anger first at Helena, then at me, then at Ruxandra.

&#x200B;

So, this is it for now. I promise you shall tell you in a few days how I escaped and how it went on. But I think it is enough for now. See you in a few days. Bye for now!

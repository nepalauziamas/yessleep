So, I don't know what happened or how this happened, but I don't have much time, please, if someone is reading this, I need help, some person or creature is impersonating me and I don't have much time until I'm next to die and it takes my place, I'm making this for you guys so you stay safe, but let me start from the beginning.

It was a normal day during summer break,
I was enjoying my time with my friend playing Arsenal on Roblox, we were having a fun time until my friend, hmmm for the sake of the story I'll call them Eddie...

What was I saying, right, until my friend suddenly said "Fabi... your old account, it's online?" Me filled with confusion hastily answered "What..?"

"Yeah dude I swear I'm seeing it online right now!"

"That's really weird, but let me check."

I proceed to check and see that it says deleted user and the account is offline.

"Dude you're funny, the account is deleted and offline, you really got me with that one Eddie."

"Dude I swear it's online and has your old user, let me send you a screenshot."

When he sent me it, I couldn't believe my eyes, the account was truly online and had my old user, I sent the screenshot in the groupchat and asked them if it was the same for them, they all said it wasn't, so I brushed it off and told him that it was probably just a bug and to just ignore it, he said he will and then we just continued playing Arsenal.

After 2 to 3 hours of playing Eddie had to go offline as he had to go to practice, we left the call and I just went to bed and started watching tik tok as usual.

After one and a half hours Eddie came back and started texting me, the conversation went something like this:

"Yo dude, Fabi, this isn't funny at all stop texting me on your other account."

"Bro what are you talking about I told you the account was deleted I'm not texting you on the "deleted account."

"Yeah? Then explain this, hold on let me send you the screenshot."

He proceeded to send me a screenshot and the stuff I saw that my other account wrote to Eddie was terrifying...

The chat looked like this:

"Hey Eddie!"

"Hi Fabi, I thought this account was deleted?"

"No... only disabled temporarily, but how are you?"

"I'm okay what about you Fabi?"

"I'm okay."

"Ahh glad to hear.."
"Yep, how would you feel if I cut your organs out and fed them to Cerberus? :D"

"What..?"

"Or how would you feel if I cooked your liver and force fed it to you? :)"

"Okay Fabi, you're scaring me"

"I'm sorry, I'm just asking questions!"

"Okay, Fabi I gtg now, bye..."

"Aww man, cya!"

When I saw that I was terrified, but what terrified me even more is that the imposter was mimicking me perfectly, it was like Eddie was actually talking to me on another account, I replied to Eddie saying:
"Dude, just ignore it, I'll go to sleep, goodnight Eddie, keep me updated on what else it texts you."

He replied saying "goodnight.'

I didn't actually go to sleep, I just started watching tik tok for some time, Eddie kept on texting me but I thought nothing of it and ignored his texts, I didn't care enough to check, it was probably just a dumb and stupid joke, so I thought nothing of it.

I guess that was a mistake...

After 2 hours of Eddie spamming me I finally decided to give his texts some time to read them, I wish I would have done that sooner...

Upon opening Discord, I saw about 36 messages from Eddie:

"Fabi help me"

"I need help, please help"

"HELP."

But one message that really caught my attention was:

"It called me, it knows I'm reading it's texts, I tried blocking it but it didn't work, it said "user doesn't exist", it sent me so many terrifying texts I don't want to talk about it, in call when I joined it said something, it was the word "Emptiness" then after it it started telling me to turn on my camera and kill myself, it told me to stream me killing my parents, it's already too late for me, if I don't kill myself it will, it knows everything about me, Goodbye Fabian, tell the groupchat about this, warn it, my parents are already dead, I'm going to kill myself next, Goodbye, I'll miss you all."

I replied "wow Eddie, you're really good at making shit up, you really made me laugh with that one, I'll talk to you tomorrow man, goodnight."

I was trying to cover how terrified and scared I felt, what if my other friends were next? What did he mean "it will kill me if I don't"??? None of this makes sense, I thought to myself "Please god let this be a stupid prank."

But I knew deep down it wasn't.

God I was so terrified, I wasn't able to sleep, how could something like this happen? It's so stupid, why to Eddie? He never did anything bad ever, why did he get that? Oh god, I can't imagine-

Then I suddenly got a picture from Eddie, I was so happy, I knew it was a stupid joke.

But you know what they say! Don't celebrate too early, and I did that.

When I looked at the image I didn't believe my eyes, I only looked it at the picture for 2 seconds but I remember the picture as if it was real life, it was... Eddie's corpse, between his parent's corpse, and his cat's corpse on top of him, all of them with their belly cut open and their organs removed and a cross placed inside of them, oh god, I was about to throw up when I suddenly passed out...

I woke up to the smell of pancakes, it was 11AM? I only slept for 5 hours, really weird, I had lied to myself about having forgotten what happened last night but I knew everything that happened, every detail...

I opened discord and went on Eddie's DMs and I saw everything was... gone?

"Huh, that's weird."

But I also got surprised by the messages Eddie's girlfriend sent me asking me where Eddie was as he usually woke up at 10AM no matter when he went to sleep.

I lied to her saying I didn't know, despite knowing that he died.

She also asked me about something:

"Fabi why and how is your deleted account back to it's old user and online?"

I didn't want to believe it, why was it Helen this time? What did she do??

"Uhm, Helen I don't know, just ignore it, it's nothing"

"Alright let me know if Eddie comes back."

"I will." I knew exactly how big of a lie that was, Eddie was never coming back, but I didn't want to tell her to unnecessarily make her sad.

I went to the pancakes to grab a few pieces and read the note next to it, it said:

"If you tell anyone about last night, you'll be next."

I got chills down my spine but I acted like it was nothing, I just ate my pancakes and continued with my day.

It was a pretty regular day, I talked to my friends and my girlfriend and I played a few games, nothing too bad!

Then during 1AM and 2AM Helen started messaging me she told me how weird I was for saying the stuff I said to her on my other account I was confused but not really, I never said anything:

"Fabi haha you're so weird, stop texting me this weird stuff on your other account!!!"

"But I'm not saying anything?"

"What?"

She sent a screenshot, oh god not again please god not again, I read the messages and they weren't any better than from yesterday, but I told Helen I knew nothing about it and told her to ignore it.

"Okay I'll ignore it."

But wait, why did it call Helen a dirty cheater? One of the messages that it sent to Eddie was "You heretic.".

That wad so weird but I thought nothing of it, I woke up at 4AM to 40 messages from Helen.

What the fuck was happening, the messages were similar to the ones Eddie sent me at the same time except for one...

"Fabi it knows I cheated on Eddie, god I'm so sorry, I didn't know what to do, it told me what happened to Eddie, you fucking bastard WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME? God now I have no time left, it called me, it said the word "Void" and it continued giving me instructions, it told me to turn on my camera and kill my dog but severing it's head from it's body, I did it, I had to do it, but it wasn't satisfied, it's coming for me, I can hear it... I hav"

And it cut off, what was the end of the message?? Oh god why was this happening, I don't want any more people to die, after about 5 minutes I got a message from Helen, it was another horrendous picture, I looked at it for barely a second but the image burned itself into my mind.

Helen's head on a stick with her 2 parents on a cross and the dog's head being hung like a deer's head, maybe a trophie, with the words "CHEATER." Written on Helen's forehead.

God it was so grotesque, it goes for so long so I'll make a part 2 if I survive until then, please someone pray for me, I'll continue praying, goodbye everyone, I'll see you guys either in a bit or never.

I hate driving at night, but when my brother called because he was too drunk to drive and stranded 45 minutes out, I had no choice. GPS led the way to a place I'd never  heard of. 
A long drive, to a house in the middle of no where, filled with loud drunken idiots. 


I get out and search for my brother, I call his phone again and again, straight to voice mail. 
I scream over the music in vain, disregard the inebriated come ons and look for someone seemingly sober enough to maybe have seen him or know him. 


Nothing, a girl puking into a plant, a couple making out in the middle of the stairs. A group at the top of the steps offers me shots, when I say no and ask for my brother, they ignore me. 

I check doors upstairs, smoke pours out of a room I open, I squint through the fog, no brother. Another room is locked, another room hosts a card game, no brother. 


Did I hear my name? I did. 
What a relief to see my brother's girlfriend standing there, by the look of disgust and annoyance on her face I knew she was sober. 


She led me to him. We managed to get him out to the car despite his will to take every shot he passed. We put him in the back seat and I started the drive towards his apartment. 


His girlfriend sat in the passenger seat apologizing for his  condition yet again and promising to finally get her license to save me from these nights. 


It was so dark. I drove slower than the limit because I didn't know the area and the roads winded into sharp bends. 


As I turn this weirdly dark corner,  there was a girl, from no where, just there in front of the car then under it. 
I screamed hysterically, throw the car into park and got out while it's still running, leaving my door open. 


To my dismay I see the blood covered yellow dress beneath my car. I cry out madly for my brother's girlfriend to call the police. 

I'm whimpering,  poor girl, I get down to try to see her condition, it was bad, I know it had to be.  

I called out again when I look up and see my brother's girlfriend standing there giving me this look of shock and disbelief. She kept screaming my name over my sobbing. 

She suddenly slapped me and I stopped. 
She started yelling at me, scared, worried. 
She asked me what was wrong with me, why would I do that? Why would I jump out of the car randomly and have an episode. She questioned if I was intoxicated. 

I pointed out the girl and she asked what girl, but when I looked back the girl was gone. She must have managed to get up while we talked. 

I started running around looking for her, she could not have gotten far.  My brother's girlfriend called me crazy, asking over and over, what girl. 

I'm still out here, it has been an hour and I'm still looking for her. She needs help, I have to find her.

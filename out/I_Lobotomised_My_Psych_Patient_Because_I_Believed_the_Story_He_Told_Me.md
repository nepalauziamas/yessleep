In 1955 I was a spritely 26 year old, I had just graduated in the field of psychology and landed a job in a hospital for the mentally afflicted. Terrible, awful places those hospitals were. Understaffed and overcrowded. It wasn’t uncommon to walk into a room and find a patient sullied in their own filth left unattended for days. 

Many of those patients had been placed into our care by their own kin. Forsaken on our doorstep, no different to an animal discarded at the pound. Worse still was that as these people withered away, forgotten by all who knew them, the funding supporting their stay slowly dried up as well. Some families chose to forgo their payments, others simply denied ever making any at all and the monetary support provided by the state could only stretch so far. 

However, among the great number of restless souls I treated one stood out. His name was Kenzou Hagihara, though we called him Ken for the sake of simplicity. Ken was in his mid 50’s by our best estimates. His paperwork listed no birth date and no patient history. He was a state assigned ward and once a month a tall dark man in a suit would visit him. 

They would sit together for hours without moving or speaking. This was especially unusual because Mr. Hagihara was ordinarily a restless man and very vocal. He would shout nonsense sentences, speaking in both perfect English and Japanese intermittently at all hours of the day. He never sat still, he twitched or jerked continually. That was of course,  until the tall man arrived. Then Ken sat motionless and silent until his departure. It was an unusual thing for certain.

I was assigned to care for Kenzou after he bit his regular nurse and she refused to go near him again. For the most part he was easy to manage. He allowed me to change his bedding and clean him. He ate the meals I provided for him without throwing them against the walls. Then one day without warning he grabbed my arm. 

For a small older man his clasp was surprisingly strong, his long fingers wrapped around my arm in an iron grip. His eyes were wild as he looked into mine, “They eat CHILDREN!” He hissed with an alarming urgency in his voice. 

Taken aback I had absolutely no idea what the poor fellow was on about. There were no children at the hospital, nor had there ever been. I couldn’t think of any answer to give him and when I didn’t respond he shook me firmly, repeating, “They *Eat* children!” 

I won’t say a word of a lie. I was terrified. I winced when he shook me, I didn’t know how to safely deescalate the situation, I had never before been faced with a predicament quite as it was and I was quite certain he would hurt me if I said the wrong thing. It was at this time of personal crisis that I remembered the teachings of one of my professors. He had preached that through building an understanding relationship with a patient one might gain insight and resolve difficulties.

Of course I had never put that aspect of psychotherapy into practice before, however, with Ken in the state that he was, it seemed as good an opportunity as any, “I will listen to you, who has the children?” I asked him, speaking in a subdued tone. 

Ken’s eyes widened and his grip loosened slightly. I had never expected such an effect from a single sentence, “The Dunkel Institute. They are… There is no word for it! Akuma. Akuma!” He told me urgently. Unfortunately repeating the word had little to no effect for I didn’t know what it meant. 

“Tell me about the A-koo-ma?” I pronounced the word as best I could and to my relief Ken let go of my arm entirely. He moved about the room then, barricading the door and closing the curtains. He even went as far as to stuff blankets under the crack at the bottom of the door. I was in equal parts alarmed and intrigued. His actions were so deliberate. Done with such *purpose*, he was far less simple than we had thought he was. 

Once he felt the room was secured he began, “My father immigrated from Japan to this country, he married an American woman soon after and I was born here along with my sister. He fought in the war too.” He paused a moment then added, “The first war, I mean. I learned two languages growing up and found work in journalism.”

I listened as he explained his career achievements and I got the impression that he could almost have been sound of mind. If not perhaps a little unconventional with some strange mannerisms. I couldn’t help but wonder how he had ended up in a place like this, that was until his silence interrupted my thoughts and I realized he had stopped speaking. 

He looked more nervous now, he twitched anxiously, as if what he was about to say next brought back great traumatic events. Ken seemed to try and soothe himself by clinging to repetitive patterns, eventually he began to pace as he continued his tale, “..After I became head journalist I received all manner of invites to press events. Celebrity occasions, invention unveilings..  Medical demonstrations..” He shuddered involuntarily.

“Then one day I was invited to the Dunkel Institute of Psychiatry. The Institute was owned by the Small family and was well known for performing miracles, healing incurable afflictions. It had never before opened it’s doors to the press, I was, as far as I knew, the only journalist to ever be requested. Of course I would have to travel interstate to attend. However the invitation was all inclusive with both travel and accommodation accounted for.. I thought it would make my career.. So I accepted the invitation. 

The establishment itself was quite some way out into the country. The boundary of the property was unmistakable. It was a giant black fence that seemed to stretch the entire length of the grounds and was adorned with sharp points a top every post. I should have known then that something was wrong. Instead I assumed it was a status symbol of their wealth, that they were rich eccentrics who valued security, or at least that was what I had intended to write in my article. 

Passing through the gates of the perimeter fence the air seemed to shimmer around us and from then it took a further five or so minutes to reach the building. It was a magnificent structure. Nothing short of a castle made from flagstone, supported by timber braces and garnished with slate tiles. I couldn’t imagine how old it was. 

My transport pulled up to the front gate of the building and I stumbled out awestruck. I thought I wouldn’t even have to write about the conference, I would only have to write about the exterior of the castle and the papers would fly off the press. I wasn’t sure where I was meant to go from there, was I supposed to knock on the gates or speak to the guards out front? It hardly mattered for as I stood transfixed, a shiny black vehicle came down the drive behind us. 

It very nearly hit me as it skidded to a stop in a cloud of dust. The driver stepped out in a hurry, he was a very striking man. Younger than I by perhaps a few years, or blessed by the gods, sporting ash blonde hair and dressed in fine clothes. My mother always said a man’s worth is in his wardrobe and I’m sure she wished I was as handsome as this man was. 

I watched as he moved to the back passenger door and pulled a child from the back seat. The child was no more than 9-years-old I was sure, with dark hair and clothes that seemed damaged though he made not a fuss at all as the man carried him. They walked past me to the gates and I noticed the smell of smoke, as if there had been a fire. I realized later that it was the pair of them who smelt like smoke and that the child wasn’t merely covered in dirt, but in ashes, soot and what looked like blood.  

‘Wash my car, then put it away. And say not a word to my brother about this.’ The man hissed at the guards as he passed, then he appeared to notice me for the first time. He seemed almost startled to see me, he glared at me for a moment, his eyes were an unusual shade of green, then he turned abruptly on his heels and disappeared into the castle. 

I had the distinct feeling that I had just been threatened though not a word had been spoken to me. My presence was displeasing, or maybe I had just seen something that I wasn’t supposed to see. I was still recovering from the brief exchange when a lady approached, ’Mr. Hagihara?’ she asked, catching me off guard.  

‘Yes.’ I answered giving a bow impulsively. The woman was just as beautiful as the man was. She was shorter than I, with long straight honey brown hair and deep brown eyes. She wore a long simple dress and smiled at me as if it amused her that I had bowed. 

‘My name is Molly. Please come with me, you have arrived later than we intended and the demonstration is about to begin. I will arrange for all your belongings to be brought to your room.’

I didn’t know what I could say so I followed her as I was told. The interior of the castle was just as magnificent as the exterior and far larger than I could have ever imagined. Pathways made of cobblestone wide enough for a car to pass through made up the entire outer inner layer and mounted torches lined the walls. 

Molly walked with purpose and knowledge until we came to a stop outside a set of wooden double doors. 

‘Your seat will be in the second row, on the left.’ She instructed, opening one side of the door and gesturing for me to go in. 

I did as I was ordered and hurried into the room. Inside it was dim and the air smelt of freshly cut roses, though I could see no flowers. I found my seat easily for it had a small silver tray with a ‘reserved’ sign sitting on it with my name printed in Japanese. This was surprising to me, as never before had any event used my native language written or otherwise. 

The seats themselves were plush covered in red velvet and arranged in a semi-circle not unlike that of a theatre. Ahead, at the centre of the room, was a stage set with a medical table that had heavy leather straps. There were others seated in the area for I could hear the low murmurs of a crowd, though with the low lighting I couldn’t see them well.  

I took my seat and set up my typewriter as a waiter came with a tray of glasses and food to offer me refreshment. I declined the drink but took a small pastry. Then the lighting in the room changed. The stage lit up well and the crowd quietened. A man stepped onto the platform, he walked with authority and his boots clacked on the wood with assurance. 

He too was a handsome gentleman. He looked astoundingly similar to the man I had seen at the gates except, his hair was long and tied back with a black ribbon so that only the shorter parts fell forward at the front. His attire was old, quite out of fashion for the time with a high collar and ruffles down the neckline to the breast of his coat. An excited murmur passed through the crowd and I could tell I wasn’t the only one to notice his unusual choice of clothing. 

Nonetheless he spoke with confidence, ‘My friends, thank you all for coming to this exciting occasion. I am Doctor Achaicus Small and today I intend to cure one of those among you. As such you are sure to witness nothing short of a miracle. Whether you have a family member afflicted by voices of the mind or are yourself troubled by the darkest of thoughts, we are here to offer you hope for a bright future.’ He began, his voice carrying across the room like a ringmaster at the circus, ‘If you would like to be chosen for yourself or a loved one, all you need do is pray in your heart for it as hard as you can, I will choose the loudest voice shortly.’ 

I typed feverishly on my writer trying to print out all the important details as fast as I could. This was exactly the kind of story that people would gossip about in the streets for days, an outlandish doctor dressed in fashion from the 1700’s curing impossible diseases. I thought myself fortunate to catch this story before anyone else.

Looking around the crowd more closely I noticed what I had missed initially, that many of them seemed to be sickly in some way or another. Someone not two seats to my right looked as near to death as anyone I had ever seen, behind me sat a person with abnormal facial features, wide eyes and a seemingly permanent smile. I was sitting in a crowd of the afflicted and that knowledge made me instantly uncomfortable. 

Still, no good article was written without some discomfort. On stage the doctor closed his eyes, giving off the impression of ‘listening’ to the crowd’s silent pleas. I could tell by then that this was a farce. Nothing more than clever showmanship preying on the vulnerable. There was no way any one of those around me could be cured. 

At last, Doctor Achaicus opened his eyes, his gaze settling on someone in the crowd several rows past me to the right, ‘Frederick.’ He spoke the name in a sickly sweet tone, ‘Your mother’s voice is very loud, I will grant you restoration.’ 

I couldn’t see who he was talking about, but I could hear a woman sobbing in relief as two of the Doctor’s assistants made their way up to her. When they came back down they were carrying between them a man. The man chosen was clearly sickly. Drool flowed freely from the edges of his mouth and he sagged to one side all the while making the most disturbing noises.

If I’m quite frank it was disturbing to see. Like the other  patients in this place. I’m not like them.” Ken stated as a matter of factly and I chose not to correct him as he continued, “Doctor Achaicus strode over to the handicapped man, placed a hand on his shoulder and spoke directly to him. I had learned how to read lips long ago, a handy talent to have if you’re too far from an important conversation in my line of work, still I instinctively leaned forward to hear what he said.

‘You will be well soon, your mother has made a generous offer for you.’ He whispered, though I’m not sure if I truly heard the words. 

Fredrick was then taken and placed on the table center stage. With assistance from the two who had brought him, he was strapped down and a woman I recognised to be Molly approached with rolls of bandage in her hands. She placed the bandages down and, at the Doctors direction, set about checking all the straps were tight while he explained, ‘This poor soul is Frederick, his mind has stretched too far, he cannot speak and he agonizes every moment. But today, *I* will cure him.’ He began.

‘I have only but to place my hand upon him and he will be cured, for you see I possess a kind of magic, gifted to me by god. I can use this magic on any who ask, if they have *the will for it*.’ Achaicus then moved to place a hand on Fredrik’s chest. A faint glow emitted from his fingertips and in response Fredrick screamed. 

It was blood curling, nothing short of primal pain and fear. Thankfully it didn’t last long then he began to convulse and foam at the mouth. Molly placed the bandages between his teeth, presumably to stop him biting his own tongue off, then it was just a matter of time. I can’t tell you exactly how long it went on for, but I can say that both Molly and the Doctor seemed perfectly at ease while the crowd murmured nervously around me. 

When at last Frederik began to recover the effects were astounding. He no longer drooled, nor did he make any unsavory sounds. Molly released the restraints holding him and he sat up. For a moment he looked confused, as if he had woken from a deep sleep, then he spoke, ‘Where am I?’ He asked, looking out at the crowd with uncertainty. 

I sat forward in my chair with great interest. Fredrick appeared to be not only cured, but improved. He looked better than most people ever did, he was handsome now, his body was no longer contorted in any unusual ways and his speech was perfect. From the crowd a woman, who I assumed was his mother, rushed down to the stage. She was quick to throw her arms around Fredrick, wrapping him in a tight embrace which he returned unsurely. 

‘What a beautiful moment.’  The doctor commented with a smile, ‘Cured and reunited with those who matter most. I can help all of you. Over the next few days I will make myself available to hear all your pleas, you have all been assigned a time, it is written on the back of your reservation sign. It is best that you are diligent in attending your assigned session. Please also remember that patience is a virtue, I will not see anyone before their assigned time no matter the reason.’ 

I checked the back of my reservation then, the time written was *1:07am Wednesday*. An odd time I thought, but stranger still was why I would need an appointment at all. I was sound of mind and no one I knew was afflicted. I couldn’t see any reason I should have an appointment, aside from to satisfy my own curiosity of course. 

The doctor continued talking though I paid little mind as movement at the edge of the stage caught my attention. The man I had seen at the gates arrived there, and stood beside the platform. He spoke to Molly for a moment, I thought she said, ‘You’re late.’ Though I can’t be sure. However if that was the case the man showed no sign that he cared. He simply stepped up onto the stage and Achaicus stopped speaking mid sentence.

‘I-… Little brother.’ Achaicus smiled, ‘At last. I thought you wouldn’t make it! Ladies and gentlemen, let me introduce to you my baby brother, Doctor Nathaniel Small, do try not to get us confused. He believes in being tardy to all events.’

Nathaniel gave a polite bow before speaking up, ‘Dressed as you are brother, I doubt many could confuse us.’ He assured the crowd joining in the jest. It was only then that I noticed how similar they did indeed appear. If not for the variance in dress and hair style I might not have been able to determine which was which. 

‘Perhaps.’ The man responded though seemed to be slightly annoyed at the returned remark. I’m trained to notice those kinds of things you know. Nothing sells papers like conflict and scandal.” Ken said with an affirmative nod to himself. I wondered if he remembered I was there. 

“After that we were permitted to leave. In order to make my appointment time I would need to stay one more day, as it was only Tuesday. Though truthfully I had no intention of attending the session. Instead I planned to use the extra time to investigate. I was sure I would dig up some dirt on the esteemed Small family.. I thought with the odd natures of these people that I could get enough material to keep people hanging on the papers for days.

I didn’t waste any time either. As soon as it got dark I left my assigned room and skulked about the castle. At first all seemed disappointingly normal, I wandered the corridors and found nothing. Speaking to servants of the manner was also pointless. They all repeated the same phrase ‘We are contracted to work here, and it is a pleasure.’ no one had a bad word to say - that would make for dull reading. 

However as I rounded the bend in the corridor I realized I could hear the foot fall of others and accompanying voices. I quietened my own steps and listened. 

‘You seem to be in better spirits now little brother. You were so dreary for weeks after your pet Orphan died, but did you really have to burn down the orphanage? It’s going to take months to find another suitable source.’ I recognised the voice, it was Doctor Achaicus though I didn’t understand what he was talking about.

A long moment and no response, then Achaicus spoke again, ‘Come now Nathaniel, you’re not still upset are you? I allowed you to attend the funeral as you wished, what more do you need?’ He sounded exasperated. 

‘Must you always go to such lengths with the theatrics?’ Nathaniel responded at last changing the subject. 

‘Humans love showmanship. And you know as well as I that they will give so much more if they believe God is making the request.’ 

‘It’s distasteful.’ 

‘Is that what your problem is now?’ 

’Why must you insist something is wrong? You said yourself that I’m no longer ‘dreary’. What more is it that you want?’ 

There was another long pause, ‘You’re hiding something from me little brother.’

‘I’m hiding nothing. I will find another way to get more children, we have supply enough for now. Focus your time on your ‘miracles’ but I will have nothing more to do with it. I have other matters to attend to…’  

Though I strained to hear more, the voices faded and when I followed after where I thought they had gone I found only empty hallways. It was perplexing that they could get far enough ahead of me that I would lose them in such a short stretch of time. Disappointed, I returned to my room, though I couldn’t help but lament on their conversation. 

As far as I was aware, the Dunkel Institute did not deal with children, only adults. I remembered the child I saw at the gates with Nathaniel, perhaps I was wrong. I thought about it for a considerable time, I couldn’t imagine what any establishment would need a supply of orphans for but I was determined to uncover the truth. I had found my headline story. 

It’s sometimes difficult to know where to start an investigation. Fortunately, as I was in the business of exposing secrets I knew where to find things that people didn’t want found and so I spent the following day lurking in lesser traveled halls. If there was a crowd I avoided the area. Whenever I caught word of any hushed conversation I listened in. 

Unfortunately I made little progress. At one time I followed Achaicus all the way to his personal chambers, though there was nothing exciting in that to report. However, it was as I was making my way back that I stumbled across what seemed to be a private garden. I didn’t think I would find anything of interest there, but the plants fascinated me. 

They were unlike any I had ever seen, there were trees and shrubs of all sizes with iridescent glowing flowers. Fascinated, I moved through the foliage carelessly until the sound of metal hitting on metal caught my attention. I hid quickly, then dared to investigate further. 

From my vantage point I could see Nathaniel, he was wielding a sword and sparring with a much smaller opponent. I had never seen anyone use a sword before, and haven’t since, they’re such an outdated weapon. Even my father kept his katanas for show only. It was with a start that it dawned on me, the man was sparring with a child, the one I had seen him with before. 

The boy seemed slow and struggled to move effectively as the man swung at him. I realized then that he was wearing a leg brace and watched in horror as the child fell back. He flinched as Nathaniel swung the sword down on him, stopping only a breath away from slicing him in two. 

‘You lose again.’ Nathaniel stated calmly.

At this the boy seemed annoyed, ’Then fight me again. I’ll win.’ 

‘Delusional.’ The man scoffed, though now helped him stand, ‘You’re far too weak to win.’ 

‘I’m not weak! It’s my leg, you said if I fulfilled the contract-‘ 

Nathaniel held up a hand, interrupting him, ’Now Eric, you didn’t ‘fulfill’ the contract, you broke it. I know as well as you do that you didn’t kill that nun.’ 

The boy looked surprised, ‘Yes I did! I stabbed her. How do you know?’ He lied poorly as children do when caught out. 

’I know because it was another who fulfilled the contract. Now answer me this, you had the intent and you named her as your choice. So why did you change your mind when you found her? Moreover, your job was already done, why pull the knife out? And why put it back in? Did you think I would be so easily fooled?’ 

‘..No, I wasn’t trying to trick you.. I thought I had done it by thinking about it with magic and I was scared.. So I pulled it out to save her, but when I did blood sprayed everywhere.. I thought putting it back in would make it stop..’ He murmured.

At this Nathaniel seemed bemused, ‘You would never have enough power to pull off something like that after only a handful of lessons. What about the fire? If my shadow hadn’t been with you, you would have burned to death as well.’ 

‘I didn’t mean to start the fire.. I stepped back too far and the candle touched the curtains..’ He explained quietly though Nathaniel burst into hearty laughter, ‘It’s not funny!’ The child exclaimed, annoyed.

‘How disappointing you are!’ he chastised, ‘I thought you were clever. I thought you had the *will* to do as contracted and the cunning to cover it up. At the very least I assumed you had the deceit to lie to me about it when you failed.’ The way he spoke was almost as if daring the child to oppose him. 

The boy grit his teeth, ‘Make another contract for me. I’ll do anything. I want to walk again!’ Eric insisted. 

’No.’ Nathaniel stated calmly, moving as if he had the intention to go, ‘Your will is too weak. You don’t mean your words, you don’t want it enough, that is clear.’ 

‘I do have the will for it!’ The child insisted, his voice raising in slight panic as the man moved to leave and struggling with his leg brace to catch up. 

‘Oh? Prove it. Then I will grant you a new contract.’ 

‘How?’ He asked quickly, jumping at the opportunity. 

‘By showing me your strength of will.’ Nathaniel mused, though offered a small kindness in waiting for the child to catch up to him, ‘Until then, I expect you will continue to train even as you are.’

‘But with my leg..’ 

‘I don’t care. Are you weak or are you not? You will train with your disadvantages until you earn another contract.’ The man said simply and I felt sick watching. He was manipulating this child flawlessly. And to what end? To have him murder someone? Would the child walking again be another ‘miracle’ like that I had witnessed with Fredrik? I had more questions than answers. 

I remained hidden among the foliage until they left the area, then I waited longer just to be sure, before eventually making my way back to my room. Now, I was careful to retrace my steps. I paid attention to the turns I had taken so that I would be able to find my way back. However, I must have become confused for I soon realized that all the hallways were different. 

There were far too many turns, landmarks, such as specific doors I remembered, were nowhere to be seen. Corners that previously only led one way, were now intersections that lead multiple directions. When I came across a staircase leading down I knew I was completely disorientated. It was an ornate staircase with small monstrous figures set on top of each banister post. I hadn’t passed a staircase of any kind beforehand, let alone one so recognisable. 

Panic was beginning to set in. I convinced myself I would find the way out faster if I picked up the pace and before long I was running. The halls continued on seemingly without end, it was like a labyrinth. I don’t know how many hours I spent in that place. There were no other people. No servants, no other guests nor any other living thing at all. 

Time seemed to stretch. I was caught in a hallucinative state and I found myself imagining that I was running on the ceiling of a spinning room, or that gravity was inverting as I climbed the walls. I thought I must have been poisoned, perhaps the shrub I had hid in was some kind of toxin? 

Eventually I laid down in defeat. The floor was smooth and cold, it seemed to me to be oddly inviting. I can’t recall how long I was there for before I heard footsteps and voices echoing through the halls. I recognised them immediately, it was the Small brothers again: 

‘-you were sent to collect livestock not contracts.’ Achaicus was saying, there was a spiteful tone to his voice though he sounded far off and muffled as if I were underwater.

‘Now now brother, I simply saw an opportunity to collect both and took it.’ Nathaniel responded calmly. 

‘You could have told me before-‘ the Doctor began, spite giving way to annoyance.

‘Before telling father and allow you the opportunity to counteract me? No, I think not.’ his younger brother cut him off. 

There was an agitated pause before Achaicus spoke again in a lower tone, ‘You should put that orphan with the rest in the meat farm. Mother and Father won’t approve of you keeping a pet. He won’t stay small forever, you know human children grow quickly. And he already has an attitude! He’s not one that will be easily trained. What do you intend to do when he gets bigger?’ 

‘You concern yourself too much. Eric is very manageable, he learns fast and have you ever seen one with such blue eyes? I will tell mother and father once he is trained. Why don’t you handle your own contracts and stop worrying over me. I have everything perfectly under control.’  Nathaniel assured dismissively.

‘You haven’t thought this through, you can’t keep him as a pet once he’s grown.’ Achaicus insisted. 

‘Nonsense. You kept Molly even once she outgrew her pet phase.’ 

‘That is not the same thing and you know it. I’ve had Molly since infancy, she is well trained, she never causes any problems. And I named her myself, you call the Orphan by his human name.’ Achaicus sounded disgusted. 

‘And *you* allow contracts to run about the halls without supervision.’ Nathaniel answered flatly now clearly annoyed. I felt my skin prickle, was he talking about me running around the halls unsupervised?

‘I know exactly where the journalist is. His appointment will start soon.’ He responded with a matter of factly tone and I broke into a cold sweat. They *were* talking about me.  

Without a moment's hesitation I got up from the floor and ran. I didn’t care where I went, I just knew I had to get away and I soon found myself standing atop the stairs I had  seen earlier. I descended them and at the bottom of the stairs I came to a carved wooden door. It swung inward easily on silent hinges and I slipped into the room quickly. Beyond was a short narrow corridor and I could see light at the end, but it was the smell that confused me. It smelt of chemicals.

I knew something was wrong immediately. This wasn’t an area I was supposed to be in. Still, my inquisitive nature encouraged me forward and I proceeded with caution to the end of the hall before stepping into the next room. It was extremely clean and strangely cold. The floors sloped slightly and had drainage down the center, it looked as though the area had been wetted down recently. 

Partitions separated the room and there were rows of industrial stoves set into spacious countertops. Chef’s tools hung along the backboards above the benches and I realized that the room must be the castle’s kitchen. There were ovens along the back wall and pantries that I could only imagine must have been well stocked given the level of organization.

I was so profoundly astonished by the place I was in that I had almost forgotten that I was being pursued. However, when I heard the door into the narrow hallway close I hurried to find an exit. There was a second door at the other end of the room and I moved for it with some haste. I felt as though I narrowly avoided discovery as I ducked into the room beyond.

Though stepping into the new room was something I immediately regretted, for it was a meat factory. Every space was filled with flesh. It hung from hooks in the ceiling, saggy piles of skin were being rolled away on a conveyor belt and blood was being drained from hanging carcasses into containers. 

For a moment I thought the remains were those of exotic animals, apes or monkeys of some kind, for they weren’t any recognisable domestic animal. Regrettably, the longer I stared the more I came to realize that the meat was in fact human. The bodies were small, child sized, hard to recognise without hands, feet or heads. 

Automated machinery churned the corpses and unusual workers manned the processing stations. Some of them turned to look at me when I entered, they were inhuman, a goblin like creature if I must describe them. Those that turned to look at me, watched me with watery black eyes. Perhaps they were wondering how I had come to be in their work room rather than on the meat hooks. 

I felt my knees give way and I sank to the ground-..” Mr. Hagihara stopped abruptly, and we both jumped as someone knocked  loudly on the door to his room. 

Ken crouched down covering his ears and starting to shout in Japanese that I couldn’t understand as the knocking intensified, “Howard? Howard! Are you aright in there? The door won’t open.” I recognised the voice as Tracy, Ken’s former nurse. 

“It’s okay, everything is fine.” I called back, “I’m just talking with Ken. It’s all okay.” I spoke trying to calm the both of them down. 

There was a pause before Tracy spoke again, “Are you *sure*?” She clarified. No doubt she was thinking Kenzou had somehow trapped me in the room. Which was of course, exactly the case. But I didn’t feel threatened. Rather, I was intrigued. I wanted to hear more of Ken’s story. 

“Yes I’m sure, it’s okay. I will call out if I need help.” I assured, grateful that she had at least stopped banging on the door. 

“Alright..” She said skeptically and I heard her move away. 

It took some time for me to calm Kenzou again and when he began his sentence a new I listened with morbid curiosity. 

“I felt my knees give way and I sank to the ground, I can’t describe the feeling you get walking into such a place. The way your stomach twists and your heart rate skyrockets. I felt faint and I threw up on the ground, then a hand touched my shoulder. 

‘Mr. Hagihara, it seems you have stumbled into an area you weren’t invited into. Please come with me now.’ It was Dr. Achaius Small, he smiled down at me kindly as if nothing at all were wrong. As if we weren’t standing in a slaughterhouse. I noticed then that his teeth seemed a little too sharp, his eyes a little too luminous… He was Akuma.. a not human, something that eats humans.

Despite his instruction I couldn’t move, my body was locked in a state of fear. He looked at me with sympathy as if he understood, ‘You can’t move can you? No matter.’ He assured, then something in the pitch of his voice changed, ‘Stand.’ He commanded and to my surprise my body followed the instruction. 

‘Come.’ He added with a wave of his hand gesturing for me to follow and I felt myself involuntarily begin to move. We walked back through the kitchen and up the stairs, I found myself watching the way his long hair trailed behind him as we walked. I think that’s all the shock of the situation allowed me to focus on. 

He led me back through the hallways and opened a door in the wall that I couldn’t even see until it was gaping. Inside was a comfortable furnished office, ‘Sit.’ He instructed and I did. I felt whatever power he held over me release and my body became my own again as he took the seat opposite me across the desk. 

‘You were quite fortunate, you’ve arrived precisely in time for your appointment, I don’t much care for tardy clients.’ He lamented as he poured a glass of water and offered it to me, ‘Thirsty? We have a lot to discuss.’ 

I couldn’t find any words to speak, I watched him slide the glass toward me with wide eyes. 

‘No?’ He questioned when I made no move to accept the drink, ‘Very well.’ He shrugged nonchalantly as if it mattered not to him in the slightest, ‘What kind of contract would you like to make with me for your life?’ He asked curious. 

‘A contract… for my life?’ I asked weakly. My own voice sounded alien to me, barely a whisper was all I could manage. 

‘Oh well yes of course! You have, by my own design, seen far more than I’m sure you had ever wanted to. You cannot simply go freely now, but you do have several exciting options. What are your thoughts on the matter?’ His eyes gleamed as he leant forward. 

I heard what he was saying, but I couldn’t quite comprehend, ‘Why..?’ I murmured. 

A smile spread from ear to ear, he probably heard that question often I thought, ‘Why? Well there are certain forms of value in my world. Meat, magic, other items of interest.’ He said proudly, then clarified for my understanding, ‘That is to say, ‘food’, ‘power’ and ‘money’ are among the most valuable.’ 

‘..Which am I?’ I asked now. 

‘Well, that depends on you Mr. Hagihara. Which would you prefer to be? Mature meat is of lesser worth, not as tender and juicy, but we do trade in it. Or of course, you may make a contract with me now. I will simply take something of value from you and in exchange you will get the remaining years of your life to live out before we collect you.’ He explained. 

There was hardly a choice, ‘A contract.. I’ll make a contract..’ I agreed quickly.

‘Delightful!’ Achaicus clasped his hands together thinking, ‘What should it be? What is the most valuable thing you could offer me?’ 

For a moment I thought he was asking me and I didn’t even know what I could offer, ‘My soul..’ I whispered horrified.

Achaicus looked surprised, then laughed wholeheartedly, ‘The soul of a sleazy journalist? I think not. You see, the most valuable souls are not ones that are offered so easily. The very fact that you offered it first means it has a low value.’ He explained, ‘No, I want something that you never realized you needed so dearly. I want, your sanity\~’ he purred. 

He sounded eager, ‘My sanity…?’ I questioned, I wasn’t a fool, I wanted to understand the entirety of the deal first.

‘Yes, believe it or not the price for one's sanity is quite high, and I have a buyer in mind. So, the proposal is this. I will release you from the constraining bounds of sanity, and you will be allowed to leave this place with your life.’ 

I thought.. It was a good deal..” Kenzou trailed off looking regretful, “To seal the contract he marked me, look!” He said as if he had suddenly found the answer he was looking for and I will admit I was most curious to see if he did indeed have a brand as proof of his story. 

Ken pushed back the hair from his face and pointed to a mark on his temple. It was a small silver blemish, no bigger than a thumb nail and I felt disappointment replace my enthusiasm. It was nothing more than a crescent shaped scar, or maybe a birthmark. 

“Do you see? Do you see?!” He asked excited, looking at me expectantly. 

“Yes, I can see.. Thank you for sharing all that you have with me.” I thanked him with a smile to mask my displeasure. 

In the weeks to come I spoke to him on many other occasions, and he reiterated the same story over again. Each time he did so, he flinched when describing the ‘slaughter house’ and he repeated the same conversations that he had overheard verbatim as if he had rehearsed his story a thousand times. It was like rewinding a cassette tape. 

For the sake of my own peace I researched the ‘Dunkel Institute of Psychiatry’. It was once owned by a wealthy German family, the Klein Family, and they were renowned for being pioneers in their field. However, towards the end of the war the castle was abandoned. There were no records for why exactly, but the ruins still stand. I believe Kenzou was a former patient of that institute prior to his transfer. 

It’s unfortunate that of the many treatment methods we tried on Ken nothing ever truly seemed to help him. He was eventually lobotomised and though it didn’t fix him, he was certainly quieter.  He spent the remainder of his days sitting in his wheelchair staring at a wall before he was eventually reassigned to another facility. I don’t know what happened to him after that, but it was the dark man whom often visited him that wheeled him away.

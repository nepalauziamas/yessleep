Before I dropped out of college (which has nothing to do with this story) some fucking horrifying happened 

Me and my roommate would stay up all night in college and read r/nosleep posts but one night we decided to sit on the rooftop (it was a small college)

We stayed up there for about 2 1/2 hours it was 10:00 when we got up there.

When we went back to our dorm I realized my roommate wasn’t with me and I was like “maybe he went to the bathroom or something” 

But 20 minutes passed and I still never saw him I thought he was playing a prank on me or something so I went to the bathroom

In the bathroom I was surprised that I didn’t see him but I still thought he was pranking me so I went to bed.

I got the urge to wake up at 3:00 am and I freaked out when he wasn’t in then room.

I went to check the bathroom but he wasn’t there either at this point I was like “he went to a bar or a drug dealer or something”

The next day I decided to go home but being the dumbass I am I didn’t tell anybody about my roommate

When I went home which was only about 15 minutes away I heard a slight knock which I lived with my parents and my brother and 2 sisters but they were asleep right after I went into my bedroom.

Then I heard another slight knock at this point I was scared to death I tried to call 911 on my phone but I was shaking so bad I couldn’t

Instead I dialed “913412” but I knew I fucked up so I didn’t press the call button

I decided to peek at the window security camera and there was a PERSON there 
I opened the window immediately and it was my roommate there with a knife stabbed in him

I pulled him inside which he was shaking and barley breathing I called 911 and I actually dialed 911 this time here’s the call from my memory

“Dispatcher: 911 whats your emergency”
“Me: my friend is lying here almost dead with a knife stabbed in him”
“Dispatcher: do you know if he stabbed himself or if someone stabbed him”
“Me: no”
“Dispatcher: a bunch of instructions I don’t remember”
“Me: answers all the questions and does the instructions”
“Dispatcher: stay on the call with me until help are there”
“Me: ok”
“Dispatcher: is he still breathing?”
“Me: barley”
“Me: police are outside”
“Dispatcher: ok bye”

They think they caught the man who stabbed him which was a man who overdosed on cocaine who admitted

My friend was to weak to speak (he’s fine now) so he couldn’t say anything about the man

That was a few years ago

I forgot about it until about a year ago I was on a walk and this tall ass thing is walking right behind me but I was like a drunk man it’s fine just turn

But in a deep voice which was deeeeeeep he said “I stabbed your friend” I ran to my home where I have my wife and 3 kids
And told my wife everything

I saw him outside our house WHICH WAS FUCKING TERRIFYING but as I was looking at him he started spinning as fast as a race car going full speed

Me and my wife were like this man is not human just like that he disappeared my friend stayed with us the next few months until he could a apartment to pay rent in

He doing fine now but the police were never able to see the fucked up figure again so It’s still alive and probably out there somewhere

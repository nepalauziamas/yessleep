This may sound strange but hear my out please, i’ve been at this airport for like 60 hours and i have no idea how to leave.

&#x200B;

I had to get on a plane to New Jersey for a new job interview, im moving there soon and i need a job asap, im in Minnesota at MSP. I was supposed to be boarding at 6:50am and i got there at around about 4:00am. I was so tired so i decided to get a coffee and as soon as i sat down i fell asleep after messaging my family that i arrived safely since im flying alone.

&#x200B;

I woke up to the barista coming over to ask if i was okay and I checked the time, 8:41am. I was so stressed i immediately jumped up and ran to the nearest desk, on the way there i noticed all the tvs with the boarding times had random destinations that i didn’t see earlier but that was the least of my concern; My job interview was at 2:45 and i needed to book a flight ASAP. I got to the desk sprinting past everyone and finally when i got to the desk i took a breath.

“Unfortunately the next flight to EWR is at 6:15pm“

”i need to get there before 12. Are there any flights to other airports or even states that are close?”

”Nope”

”But you didnt even check”

”This is the 14th time you’ve asked me, it will always be the same answer”

&#x200B;

i didn’t know what to say, i thought to myself if this is some sort of sick joke i am not in the mood and walked away to find another desk, but it was the same lady. I turned away and found somewhere to sit, so many questions ran through my head. I took my phone out but i had no service, that was strange, i had service when i got here and all my texts sent without a second of delay. Theres a wifi sticker on the wall saying free wifi, surely that can’t be right? maybe i was just in a bad signal area, I couldn’t hear myself think from how busy the airport was. I looked up at the tv to see what flights are leaving any time before 12 and saw the only places were New York and North Carolina. I sat back and thought of what to do, I had a soar throat so i went to the nearest shop and went to buy a bottle of Dr Pepper.

”sorry we only accept chips”

”chips?”

”yes, just let me scan your neck and i can use your universal banking to pay”

”what the heck is wrong with you people?”

I walked away and went to the nearest bathroom to get a drink out of the taps, i had enough of this bullshit, the water tasted sour, almost bitter. I looked in the mirror and thought something looked off about me, like when your face just looks odd for no reason. I had enough of the weird occurrences  and went to find the nearest boarding gate which was New York, people were sat waiting patiently so i found a spot and waited.

&#x200B;

An hour passed and i figured maybe the flight is delayed, i put my headphones in and started listening to my downloaded music.

&#x200B;

3 hours passed, i asked the nearest person to me when the flight to New York was supposed to board.

”New York? sorry they boarded like 2 hours ago, this is the flight to New Mexico”

”what? but you’ve been sat next to me for 3 hours now, and so has everyone else. How could they have boarded if we’ve been sat here for longer?”

”what? i got here like 10 minutes ago, are you okay?”

I got so freaked out i just turned away and waited.

&#x200B;

more time passed, by now i wasn’t even checking the time anymore, could’ve been up to 4 hours that i was sat down waiting for someone to move, then the speaker announced:

”to our fellow passengers on the flight to New Mexico, we will be boarding now”

I waited for someone to move, i turned to the same girl and asked if shes not getting up to board.

”sorry but i don’t know what you’re talking about, i’m getting on a flight to Toronto“

”But i asked you earlier and you said you’re  boarding the flight to New Mexico?”

”i don’t know what you are talking about, do you need a drink? That flight left hours ago”

i turned away with literally no idea whats going on, I’ve been sat here in the same exact spot for days now, so many flights have boarded but not a single person ever got up, every time I asked if they were boarding the next flight or how long they’d been there there was always a different answer, i‘m losing my mind and i don’t know whats going on, i’ve given up all hope now.

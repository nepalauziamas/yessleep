It was supposed to be a simple heist; a theft of some ancient, time-forgotten artifacts. I was contacted by an *associate* of mine, with whom I’ve had previous dealings in the business of artifact plundering and unsanctioned excavations. Unlike myself, this associate had been in the business for quite a while; countless *centuries* had passed by him, and yet he wore a face that showed only the passage of a few decades.  

Despite our vast difference in age, I’d always considered myself roughly his professional equal. My highly specialized skills are unrivaled among other humans, and only a select few could even hope to reach the level of theft-craft I had achieved during my first fledgling years in the business.  

Together, once having made the necessary preparations, this associate and I set out to the target site—a derelict compound forsaken for nearly three centuries, its grounds overgrown and impenetrable to sight from all but those aware of its exact coordinates and grounds. The compound spanned several acres in a scarcely populated region of Southeast Asia, with several buildings comprising the overall campus, although most of these had fallen to ruin through the passage of untended cycles. The main building, barely kept from total dissolution by its specially fortified structure, was our destination. Therein was our prize.  

Tucked away somewhere within, said to be guarded by both material and spectral sentries, was a set of robes, or a cloak of some kind, that once worn granted the wearer with both increased durability and prolonged biological life. The material of the robes, it is said, literally seeps into the skin of whomever adorns it, becoming forever a part of them—the material irremovable, but the power everlasting.  

My associate and I, who from here on I will refer to as Yakub, arrived and waited for a third to join our party. This additional person was, like Yakub, a being of inhuman conception. While Yakub could be described as the brains of the operation, the third gentlemen could be considered the brawn. I was the guide, of sorts; knowledgeable of not just the area, but the long sought-after item itself, as well as the obstacles which could potentially inhibit our progress. 

The only thing beyond my knowledge was the manner of *animate* defenses that awaited us. Despite the preternatural abilities of my associates, I was still skeptical regarding the more fantastical entities alleged to exist within the crumbling structure. I've had past dealings with inhuman entities, but the rumors regarding those entombed within the sunken depths of the compound were extremely dubious; many allegedly belonging to orders of existence both phantasmal and alien.  

As I’ve mentioned before, the greater populace—comprised mostly of farmers and tradesmen—is ignorant to both the compound and the secret it hides; no one ventures to its grounds. The wildlife, due to some natural, instinctual aversion, never wanders far into the dust-choked interiors. Even my vampiric associates need to feed, to fuel their nigh undying lives. Any supernatural entities within the desolate structure would be hard-pressed to find sustenance among the heaps of crumbled stone and wild, biologically inimical vegetation. They'd sooner encounter starvation than edible prey. 

After around an hour of kicking stones, swatting at gnarly weeds that seemed to lean with a baleful sentience towards us, and cursing the lateness of that third member, the other vampire finally arrived. As did Yakub, this blood-sucker wore a thick hoodie to which a face-mask had been stitched, to conceal his skin from the ever-scathing sun. Only his black eyes were visible, and if I hadn’t grown accustomed to those of Yakub, I might’ve shrunk away at the innate malignance in that inhuman gaze.  

We briefly went over our plans with him, not bothering to admonish him for his tardiness. Insulting a vampire is a deadly thing to do, even for another vampire. Despite our near equal appearance of physique, the vampires wielded a preternatural strength I couldn’t hope to combat.  

Vile weeds and time-worn stones were pressed and crumbled beneath our boots as we strode towards the building. The entrance to the compound was unguarded, neither by door nor by warden, and we entered freely, eyes darting excitedly as we crossed the threshold. The darkness therein was near-complete, but seemed harmless. The air was heavy with the exhalations of wild-grown vegetation and the dissolution of wood and stone.  

The second vampire, who demanded that I call him Junaid, removed a flashlight from a pouch he wore on his belt, and shone it into the darkness. The shadows dispersed, and the light revealed the expected ruin. Motes of dust hung in the air, and cobwebs spanned vacant doorframes. There were no identifiable remnants of those who had worked there; even their bones would’ve moldered to dust in the centuries since the building’s use.  

Having memorized the layout of the building, I wasted no time in exploring the grounds, and led my associates towards our goal. The famed robes we sought were held within a locked room, the atelier of a wicked and magically empowered seamstress who had worked for the power-hungry lord of the region, in exchange for test subjects for her witchcraft.  

We walked boldly through corridors littered with the debris of caved-in walls and half-sunken ceilings; and the detritus of those objects and furniture that had once been used by the long-dead occupants. Junaid’s beam cut through the ever-present darkness with ease, and nothing seemed notably out of the ordinary. No phantoms shifted in the murk; no vermin, hostile or otherwise, stirred from the many dust piles.  

After walking for some time, we finally arrived at the section of the building in which the seamstress wove her threads and magic. Unlike the various doors through which we had passed, the bronze doors to her atelier were firmly locked. Having been the lead through the easily navigable areas, I stepped aside to allow one of my companions to try their hand. But despite their enhanced strength, neither could get it to budge, and their simultaneous efforts only resulted in the fall of a bit of dust from the gold-lined doorframe.  

Yakub, the younger of the two vampires, was a patient man. But Junaid, nearing the senescent years of his protracted lifespan, had grown incurably impatient. A flash of his ivory incisors was all the incentive I needed to hastily figure out a way to bypass the workshop’s ostensibly impenetrable door.  

Seeing as how brute force hadn’t had any measurable effect, I quickly concluded that the door was sealed not by a physical restraint, but a magical one. In the planning for the theft, I had briefly considered the employment of explosives, but eventually ruled out their use; with the building being so old, the use of such instruments could result in the total destruction of the structure, with us still inside. My companions could’ve possibly endured a structural collapse, but I could not.  

With the simmering vampire to my left, I closed my eyes and tried to recall the pre-human incantations I had learned during a previous adventure. As my lips began to work the words, and my fingers wove the invisible runes into the air, I heard the door ahead begin to tremble. A few seconds later, it shook violently, barely contained by the sorcerous locks. With a great shout, and a thrust of my hands into the dust-choked air, I at last dispelled the ancient magic that inhibited our entrance. The doors flew open, and a crimson haze drifted upwards until it dispersed entirely.  

We entered the workshop abreast, and at that moment each of us wore a face-spanning grin. The room had been preserved through the many derelict cycles, with only the smallest evidence of disrepair present in the ancient machinery. Tables strewn with familiar fabrics and other, unfamiliar materials sat throughout the room. Tools of sewing and cloth alteration littered every surface, and great ropes of thread and string sat in baskets, or lay draped over finely-carved mannequins of clay or stone.  

In the center of the room sat the object of our efforts. Encased in bronze and laid beneath a thick sheet of glass were the fabled robes. The case rested on an inclined table, also made of bronze, so that the entire structure tilted back, as would a patient’s chair during a medical examination. The robes were untouched by dust, time, or corruption; a faint, pinkish light seemed to emanate from the vermillion threads—the power within having persisted through time.  

Well before setting down the details of the theft, we had agreed on how the robes would be used once obtained. Despite routinely dealing with the inhuman, I had no desires for my own supernaturally extended life. I’ve met various people who’ve utilized sorcerous means to extend their lives for centuries or longer beyond the hardiest of men, and the madness to which they all inevitably succumb is not something I would ever desire for myself—no matter how wonderful life leading up to that dreadful dementia might be. Humans were not meant to be immortal.  

The plan was for Yakub to take the belt that bound the robe to the wearer. The robes, as the legend goes, are imbued with a potent and volatile magic. Once adorned, the robes would in a sense come alive, and make an almost sentient attempt to escape their absorption; much like a maddened steed would attempt to unseat a rider.  

Being of a stronger breed than the human for which they were meant, Junaid would need no assistance in restraining the supernatural threads until they were subsumed. My cut of the prize was simply a a bundle of threads, to be carefully excised from Yakub’s belt. I would sell these for a staggering amount, to buyers who cared only for the raw magic instilled therein—a magic that could be used for other purposes beyond immortality. Yakub would use the belt for purposes that he said I needn’t be made aware of. Junaid, nearing the limits of his vampiric life, simply wanted to live longer.  

Not forgetting the rumors of the robe’s eternal guardians, I set my gaze on the corners and shadow-fallen spaces of the room, while Junaid went to dislodging the case from its base. We agreed that it would be too dangerous to remove the robes whilst still in the building, where danger could possibly lurk amidst the cobwebs and desolation. Yakub, extremely level-headed and keen-eyed even for his kind, joined me in surveilling the many recesses of the room.  

A grunt from behind us signaled the completion of Junaid’s task. While the robes were light, the case in which they rested weighed several tons, and yet he hoisted it onto his shoulder with the ease befitting one of his nature. With our primary objective completed, we exited the room, and I began leading my companions back through the debris-cluttered hallways of the building, with Junaid’s flashlight in my hand.  

We had made it halfway to the exit when danger struck. I’d even started to believe that there hadn’t been any truth at all to the rumors of eldritch and sorcerous guardsmen. But as I turned a corner, the flashlight’s beam fell upon a wavering shape in the darkness; a shadow that did not flee before the powerful light. While it bore the general shape of a man, it was taller than all of us, with the crown of its shadowy skull only a few inches below the ceiling. Its limbs were massive, and despite its apparent immateriality, I sensed that it possessed a Herculean strength; one that matched if not outright surpassed my vampiric cohorts.  

For a moment, we all stood speechless, gawking at the Titan apparition before us. Then, in character impatience, Junaid set down his burden and stepped forward, brandishing a curved knife he’d unsheathed from his belt. A gem, set within the hilt of the knife, gleamed with iridescent brilliance in the beam’s light, and I knew at once that it possessed magical qualities. With a quickness impossible for even the fittest of men, Junaid slashed at the towering specter in a broad, vicious arc.  

But the blade soared through the threads of shadow, striking no solid thing. The shade merely stood there, apparently fearing no harm from the enchanted weapon. Junaid, with the same demonstrated quickness, jumped back. He whispered something to Yakub, and before I could discern what had been said, they both charged at the shade. Yakub now wielded a weapon similar to Junaid, his also magically begemmed. Together, in lethal tandem, they assailed the spirit with vicious stabs and swipes, aimed with savage skill and force.  

But the specter withstood each blow; truly; it truly seemed ignorant to the violence being dealt against it. It made no moves of offense nor defense, and simply stood erect, like some phantom that had only a partial, immaterial footing our dimension.  

Even vampires may grow tired, and despite all their efforts, the spirit stood unscathed after nearly a minute of consistent attacking, so they relented in their concerted barrage and backed off. Junaid, incensed by the futility of his actions, announced that the image before us was nothing more than just that—a harmless image. He picked up the encased robes, and strode on towards the shadow-form, determined to pass through it and continue on. Considering how the image hadn’t yet given any indication of hostility despite the violence performed on it, I assumed Junaid would pass through unharmed.  

But just as the shoulder-mounted case touched the shadow-form, the specter suddenly became animate. With a thrust of power like some spectral flex of energy, it sent Junaid flying back, whilst the case remained hovering in the air, as if lodged within the shadow itself. Junaid landed on the ground with a grunt, but quickly sprang to his feet, blade drawn. Yakub, who had remained behind with me, joined Junaid, ready to fight alongside his kin—even though their previous efforts to harm the entity hadn’t been fruitful at all.  

The shadow, now alive and aware, radiated a palpable malignance that endarkened the area around it. The beam of light that had spotlighted it was blotted out, as if the batteries within the device had had their power totally siphoned by the deepening murk. With it now dead and useless, I tossed the flashlight to the floor. My battle-ready companions possessed a heightened sight, and the flashlight had largely been for my benefit. Even though the darkness grew in its totality with each second, I could still see the gems of their weapons, which glowed with some innate luminosity. I needed only those glints of ever-changing light by which to track the melee.  

Half-blinded by the darkness, I tried to follow those twinkling rocks as they speedily soared through the air. To what effect, I could not tell, and the rapidity with which they went back and forth without halting worried me doubly. The first cause of worry: their inefficacy against the gloom-born entity seemed more apparent with each unchecked strike. The second, the less likely but not totally impossible idea of my companions turning on me for whatever reason. Those blades, highly dangerous on their own, were weapons of mortally incontestable doom when wielded by the vampires. If they deemed me unnecessary, I would not be able to defend myself.  

A sudden and high-pitched cry pierced the air, and the subsequent rattle of an object falling to the floor echoed throughout the dark corridor. One of the self-illumined gems glowed on the ground—a blade had been dropped. A few moments later, the light which had fired it died out; its wielder either weaponless or dead.  

I could not tell which vampire had been neutralized—their gems had shone with indistinguishable variances of color. Fear then took hold of me, and I couldn’t bring myself to call out. The other gem still danced about in the air, but its movements arced slowly, as if the blade-wielder was injured. I bent down and patted the floor around me for the flashlight. Even its dimmed light would be of use, now that the fight had taken such an unexpected turn.  

My fingers passed over moldering debris until moments later I finally found the cold metal of the flashlight’s handle. Ahead, the remaining gem still shone, though its light had diminished considerably, and maintained a weak, purplish color. Despite having no real insight into the weapon's use or the gem's composition, I sensed that this bespoke of the vampire's waning strength. 

Just as I turned on the flashlight and cast its pitifully faint beam onto the fight, a terrible, agonized cry arose, and I beheld a sight unrivaled by the blackest of nightmares.  

The towering phantom which had endured the assailing blades of those skillful vampires was holding up Yakub by the throat, with a limb still no more tangible than a wisp of shadow. Yakub struggled weakly; a truly commendable effort, considering the state of his body. The shadow had changed in the brief lapse of light, and several other limbs had grown from its body. These more resembled the jointed appendages of some colossal insect, than those of a largely proportioned man. One of these trunk-sized limbs had gone through Yakub’s stomach, and the tip of the protruding talon dripped steadily with the vampire’s blood. Despite the debilitating injury, Yakub still fought; attempting to pry himself from the grasp of the monstrous phantom.  

Turning the flashlight to the floor, I saw Junaid’s body—or what was left of it. His corpse had been ruthlessly savaged; the bloody remains were beyond the salvage of even his vampiric regeneration. Fear quickened my heart, and I felt the onset of a full-blown panic. I tried to scamper away, even as Yakub defied death and sent his blade futilely into the faceless head of that abominable specter. As the light receded and the grim scene grew dim, I glimpsed the phantom transform again, and heard Yakub let out a scream that was disconcertingly human.  

I ran through pitch-black darkness. The sounds of my footfalls seemed to echo all around me, making it seem as if I were being pursued by a legion of demons. I turned corners blindly, my mental map of the area burned from my mind by mounting waves of terror. The darkness seemed to deepen with every turn, and my fright grew feverishly; until I was no longer an intelligent being seeking escape, but only an animal in an instinctive flight of survival. After perhaps the sixth or seventh turn, I heard a loathsome noise issue from behind me, and even as fear compelled my burning legs onward, a black curiosity impelled my head to turn.  

Behind me, *crawling* upon the floor, ceiling, and walls, was a truly horrific thing: a multi-legged shadow, no longer bearing any recognizable morphology; merely an amorphous blackness that propelled itself towards me with its massive, insect-like legs. And despite this abhorrent transformation, the case that held the robes was still embedded within its body. It was disconcertingly silent, as if driven not by hate, but some malicious autonomy; a spectral machine set upon me by some unknowable evil.  

Somehow, I managed to sprint even faster, and my lungs were briefly able to cycle air with greater efficiency. With a ghastly doom on my heels, and madness on the mind, I fled on—exhaustion and terror a single, awful sensation. A few moments later, through instinct or some unconscious recollection, my body was as last steered in the direction of the exit. With a last burst of speed that would’ve impressed even those poor, slaughtered vampires, I propelled myself through the exit and into the warmth of daylight.  

I landed onto the rubble-littered ground and rolled several times. By mere chance, I came to rest face up, with my gaze pointed directly at the front of the compound’s main building. A moment later, that black tempest of shadow burst forth, and at the touch of daylight it exploded—disintegrating into a baleful gust that whirled about the area for a moment before dying away.  

And on the ground, in the wake of the abysmal storm, was the case that contained the magical robes. 

 Having seen the shadow’s ultimate form—if that’s what it had truly been—I finally understood why the tales of the robe’s guardians differed so much. It was a thing without definite shape, and would’ve presumably assumed whatever form necessary to seize and destroy its prey.  

On that day, two vampires and a human had entered that derelict and haunted compound, had faced a heretofore unimagined horror, and the human—the weakest of them all—was the only one to survive.  

I rose, dusted myself off, and opened the case. After what I had narrowly escaped, I figured it wouldn't hurt to provide myself with a little extra protection for future adventures.

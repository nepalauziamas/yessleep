  I was looking forward to this trip for weeks. We planned this trip over a month ago. We came to an AirBnB about 4 hours away from where we live to have a weekend getaway. It isn't anything too fancy, just a cozy small house with a lake about 20-30 feet away from the side door with a paddleboat and dock for fishing. Just me and my brother James came. The drive was excruciating and boring, I forgot to bring books to read on the way there. We did stop about 2 hours in at 3:28 to get some McDonald's which I was thankful for because I was starving. Once we got there the first thing we noticed was the smell it was awful, like manure. Despite that everything seemed okay when we arrived at 6:13. I picked my room and unpacked my stuff. 

   Me and James finished unpacking and decided we wanted to go fishing, since there was a nice dock and we had brought our tackle. We also thought ahead and bought some bait on the way.  So we went down and started fishing. It was pretty slow and we were down there for about an hour before I had to go back to pee and I asked James to watch my rod for me just incase I got a bite. I didn't take long maybe 5 minutes  before I went back out and James was gone. I thought he was playing a prank on me but then I noticed both rods were bent indicating that a fish was on and James wouldn't ever miss the opportunity to reel in a fish regardless of the size. 

   So I called the police and they said they would be here in 10 minutes. While I waited I decided to reel the rods in so the fish didn't pull them into the water but here's  where things started to get really weird. The second I  picked up the rod it stopped bending, so thinking it was just snagged I put it down to get the other rod and when I put it down it bent again instantly. Confused I picked it up and again it stopped bending and went back to normal. So because I was confused at this point I reeled the rod in all the way and found a piece of James's red shirt he was wearing on the hook. I didn't touch it because I figured it might be evidence. Then I remembered the other rod and hoped it might a clue or a prank or something I really didn't want to believe he was really gone. So as i picked up the second rod to reel it in the same thing happened as the first one it stopped bending. This time knowing what would happen I didn't bother putting it back down before reeling it in and whe I got it in there was nothing, but almost as if  on cue I heard it. James's voice, he yelled.

"DANIEL HEL-"

My head snapped towards the direction I heard it from and I shouted back desperately,

"JAMES? WHERE ARE YOU"

Which was only met with gurgling sounds coming from beneath me, beneath the dock. Seconds after an ambulance along with the police arrived and asked me questions and the paramedics checked me out and asked me simple questions probably to make sure I wasn't delusional or something. After they concluded I was fine and the police taped off the dock and started to investigate I told them I would be back I just needed to go wash off my face. I washed my face and came back quickly, eager to find James or anything about what happened to him, but when I got back out there everyone was gone, the 3 paramedics and 4 police officers all vanished almost without a trace leaving nothing but their vehicles and a police radio on the ground. At the same time when I walked out I had heard something I think it was a muffled scream. When I got closer I heard his voice again but this time there were 2 of him talking at the same time. 

"HELP ME DANNY" 
"RUN DANNY GET OUT OF HERE"

Both sounded heavily muffled maybe by a liquid of some sort but either way I ran back and I am now sitting in my car trying to figure out what to do. Which James is the real James? If I leave will this keep happening to others? Does the owner of the property know anything about this? Has it happened before? These are all questions running through my head as I type this to ask for help and advise. PLEASE I WANT MY BROTHER BACK, PLEASE HELP.

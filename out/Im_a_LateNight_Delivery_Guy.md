I think it's cool that there's a subreddit like this where people like to get immersed in scary stories whether they are real or not. Because if you made a subreddit where people were supposed to post their "real experiences" you'd get fictional tales either way. So might as well just be open to either.

Anyway, my story is real, and because it's real it's far more mundane. 

&#x200B;

No matter what your politics are, you have to admit that economic times are rough. I'm a dude who is struggling to pay his bills. So at night, I work as a food delivery driver as a side-hustle. Mostly for doordash.

&#x200B;

Since I work at night, I also come out at the same time that the crazies do. Unhinged people like to come out at night, especially in bad neighborhoods. So I've been having some wild experiences and so telling you guys about the spooky or scary experiences I've had will let me vent but also have some fun with the struggles I'm having.

&#x200B;

Most of my deliveries are pretty easy and straightforward, I go to a food restaurant, I pick up the delivery and I drive it to the customer. I'm pretty good at it, I have a 5 star rating. The only thing that really stops me from being a top dasher right now is that sometimes I'm late with deliveries. I have about 88% rate of being on time. Most of the time when I'm late it's because places like McDonalds operate on damn skeleton crews at night and move slow as fuck. I think if I delivered more in the day I'd be able to move quicker.

I also enjoy cruising at night because there's not a lot of people on the road and I can just listen to my music or a podcast while I drive. It's pretty comfy and on a good night I can make a hundred bucks.

 During my first week I was making a delivery(I think it was Taco Bell), I got the food and started driving over to the apartment complex. 

&#x200B;

It was about 7pm. 

&#x200B;

The apartment complex was on a sketchier side of town, but I dropped the food off and got back in my car. Now, this apartment complex had a very narrow parking lot that was more of an alleyway than a parking lot. As I was driving forward, I see a lady standing in front of my car blocking my way. 

I stopped for a moment, and then began to try driving around her.

The moment I did this, she immediately ran in front of my car to block me again and started making obscene gestures with her hands and sticking her butt out at me, dancing around.

&#x200B;

Now I was pretty shook. I figured this lady must be insane, maybe she was on drugs or something. I wasn't sure if I should get out of my car and tell her to move. I'm a pretty big guy and I'm no pushover, I'm 6ft and I can bench more than 200lbs, I go to a boxing gym too. But I was scared because if she's on drugs who knows what she could do to me, and I just want to do my deliveries man. 

Also I've never had a crazy woman block my car before so I was trying to weigh my options. 

&#x200B;

After a few seconds I ended up shifting into reverse and backing up. Luckily for me, I found another way out of the apartment complex after I backed up for a while. But this encounter made me realize that I'm probably gonna encounter crazy people once in a while if I keep doing this job.

&#x200B;

Later that same night, I got another delivery. I forget what type of food it was. But it was yet another delivery in a sketchier part of town. I parked my car on the side of the road and made my way forward. 

As I approach the apartment complex I see this big buff guy, he's shirtless and has tattoos all over his body that at the very least seemed like they could be gang-related. Now I wouldn't care about that if he was out having a smoke or whatever. But this dude was actively walking around the complex like he was patrolling. He would circle around the complex like he was watching for something.

At one point he passed by me, but didn't seem to care about me. Probably because it was pretty clear I was a delivery guy. 

&#x200B;

Anyway those experiences along with the general creepy vibe of being out alone in the streets at night made me decide to buy a can of pepper spray for myself the next day. I also carry a 9mm in my car because I heard in some shadier parts of town there's been an increase in carjacking, and I need my car.

I'll continue posting more stories about my "delivery adventures" if people are interested.

Me and Aaron stood over Clark's corpse, looking at him in silent regard. He lay with a small round hole between and slightly above his eyes, a red puddle slowly spreading out from his head. He didn't liquify into black slime like the Residents did when you killed them. Maybe it was because he had still been human when he died. His eyes were closed and his expression was peaceful - maybe even relieved.

I stared at him, imagining his mortal body in some other realm at this very moment, hooked up to life support machines in a hospital room, all his vital signs now negative, the shrill screech of an EKG as he flat-lined. Maybe his family - assuming he had one - was gathered around him, their faces streaked with tears, a nurse covering him with a sheet, a priest there to offer spiritual consolation, assuring them that he was "in a better place now."

And who knew, maybe now he truly was. He sure wasn't an inhabitant of Dead Land anymore, and anyplace had to be an improvement over here.

"And then there were three," Aaron whispered beside me.

I waited to hear Nadine's response, something cynical and sarcastic, but she said nothing. Gradually I registered that me and Aaron were alone in the candle-lit room. I looked around. "Hey," I said, "where's Nadine?"

Aaron looked and saw she was gone. "Nadine!" He called out. "Shit, where the hell did she go?"

"She must have slipped out while we were busy with Clark," I said.

"Christ, what the fuck could she be doing?" he said, grabbing a candle. He thrust it into my hand and took one for himself. "Come on, we gotta go find her."

We left the Police's Chief's office.

We didn't have to look very long to find her.

"Over here," she calmly called over to us from the end of the police station corridor. We looked...and froze.

Nadine was standing by the barricaded entrance doors. Residents were pounding and snarling behind the reinforced glass. They could see Nadine inside, living prey, and the sight was causing them to become increasingly agitated.

Nadine smiled at us. It was a strangely serene smile, almost beautiful in a way. The small of a woman who had finally found some measure of inner peace.

In one hand she was holding a burning candle of her own. Her other hand was grasping the padlock securing the chains wrapped around the entrance door handles. The padlock had been unfastened - Nadine must have taken the key - and the chromed steel shackle of the lock was barely holding the ends of the chains together.

We were stunned silent for a moment, then Aaron spoke.

"Nadine," he said, slowly and cautiously, "what are you doing?"

"It's better this way, Aaron. Better for all of us. We're just prolonging the inevitable. It'll be a horrible way to go, painful, but only for a few moments. Then it'll be over and we'll be free. Once and for all we'll be *free*." Her voice was very calm and resolved. It almost sounded sane.

"Goddamnit, Nadine, you don't *know* that!" Aaron argued, trying to reason with her. "What if dying just leads to something even *worse?"*

"I'll take that chance," Nadine said, still smiling, then yanked off the padlock, releasing the chains.

Instantly the door burst open and a horde of Residents flooded into the station. Dozens of them.

*"HATE LIFE, HATE LIVING! HATE LIFE, HATE LIVING!"*

*"HOLY SHIIIIIT!"* Aaron screamed.

Nadine was swarmed. They dragged her down, piling on top of her, ripping her apart. her. She never screamed. Not once.

More Residents poured into our former safe haven, charging in the direction of me and Aaron.

*"LIFE! HATE LIFE, HATE LIVING! HATE LIFE, HATE LIVING!"*

Aaron grabbed me by my arm and screamed into my face: *"Back into the office! Hurry!"*

We fled the invading horde down the corridor and dodged back into the Police Chief's office, slamming the door.

Aaron locked the door then looked at it. He was shaking with barely controlled panic. "This door won't hold them back for long, we gotta barricade it!" His eyes darted wildly around the office. He pointed. "The desk! Help me move it!"

We struggled to lift the heavy oak desk and carried it to the door. The ammunition still piled on top rolled off and scattered in every direction.

The frosted glass pane in the top half of the Police Chief's door shattered inward and half a dozen rotted arms reached in, grabbing for us.

*"HATE LIFE, HATE LIVING!"*

We placed the desk against the door, but it only came up waist-high, leaving the top half with the shattered window exposed. 

"Help me with this filing cabinet!" Aaron ordered me.

We lifted the filing cabinet and stacked it on top of the desk. It blocked the shattered window. We piled more stuff on the desk - a lamp, a chair, one of the cots, until we had it pretty well barricaded. We could still hear the crazed corpses screaming their endless, repetitive chant outside.

Safe for the moment, we collapsed against the barricade to catch our breath.

"That crazy fucking bitch," Aaron muttered in disbelief. "I can't believe she actually did that."

"Maybe she thought she was doing us a favor," I offered.

"We're trapped..." Aaron said quietly, as if just realizing it himself. He looked at me, smiling bitterly. I saw there were tears in his eyes. "We're fucked, kid, you understand that, right? We are officially el fucko."

"There's gotta be something we can..." I didn't finish. Even as I was speaking, Aaron's words were sinking in and I was realizing he was absolutely right. There was no way out of this. No avenues left we could pursue. Even if we could somehow escape the infested police station, we would still be trapped in Dead Land. There were only two of us left now. There was very little ammunition, even fewer candles, and no place we could take refuge. I saw just how utterly hopeless our situation was and the weight of this realization threatened to overwhelm me. I realized I was starting to cry myself.

"The way I see it, we got three options," Aaron said. "One: we can wait until they break through the barricade and let them kill us, two: we can try fighting them off with whatever ammo we have left and wait until the candles run out and the Shadow Lurkers take us, or three..."

He took out his pistol, ejected the magazine, picked up two bullets off the floor, loaded them into the magazine, replaced the magazine and chambered a round.

"Which sounds preferrable to you?" He asked me.

"Just make it quick," I told him.

He placed the pistol between my eyes. "It was nice knowing you, kid."

"Same," I told him, trying to keep the tremble out of my voice. I braced myself for the shot, wondering where I was going to wake up next time.

He started to pull the trigger...but then stopped. He looked at me, at first puzzled, then shocked. 

"What is it?" I asked him.

"What's...what's happening to you?" Aaron said.

"What do you mean?" I asked him, confused.

"Look at your hand, can't you see it?"

I raised my hand to my eyes. I couldn't believe what I was seeing.

My hand was turning *transparent*. I could see the wall of the office through my palm. As I watched, bewildered, it grew more and more transparent and ghost-like, as if it was losing substance, fading out of reality. I realized it wasn't just my hand; my *entire body* was slowly turning invisible.

"What the fuck is *happening* to me?" I screamed in panic.

Aaron just looked at me with incomprehension. Then a new look dawned in his eyes. An expression I hadn't seen during my entire time in Dead Land. 

Hope.

"Kid, I don't know for sure, I never saw this before, but I think maybe you're starting to wake up! Return to the Land of the Living!"

And as I was fading out of reality, reality was fading away around me. Aaron and the Police Chief's office were growing dim and hazy. I could feel myself drifting away, being pulled back to the living world, out of Dead Land.

Aaron spoke to me one final time, his voice growing fainter with every word.

"My ex-girlfriend's name is Anna Hastings. Find her if you can. Tell her she was right about me, I was a coward. We should have kept it. Tell her I'm--"

But that was all I could make out. Aaron's voice faded to silence. The last thing I saw was Aaron raising the pistol to his own temple. Then he dissolved out of view. Everything dissolved.

Once again I was plunged into blackness.

I woke up screaming. It took a moment to realize where I was. Not at Vee’s beach party, and not with Marlee standing in front of me, rotting away into something that resembled a human being only in the abstract sense. I tried to remember what she’d said to me in the dream, but it was like trying to hold onto a fistful of water; droplets of it were already slipping in between my fingers and out of reach.

I sped through my morning routine, eager to escape into the warm sunshine and fresh air. Mom had left an orange post-it note stuck to the fridge:

*Don’t forget, Stephen is coming over for dinner tonight! ☺*

*Love,*

*Mom*

How could I have forgotten about it when she’d never told me in the first place? I tamped down the automatic swell of annoyance and left the apartment. It wasn’t until I was outside that I relaxed enough to mull over what we’d learned from Marlee’s phone. Colton might think otherwise, but I was certain she must have been dating a teacher at Harker. I closed my eyes, sifting through various memories. Pretty much all of our teachers had loved Marlee. Especially--

I stopped so suddenly that the old lady who’d been walking a few feet behind me nearly collided with me. She shot me a dirty look, but I barely noticed it; my mind whirred frantically, putting all the pieces together. How often had Marlee volunteered to spend time with Mr. Cunningham after school? Whenever I’d bothered to ask her about it, she’d always hand-waved it off as doing extra credit, her face lit up and glowing.

I remembered the time we’d encountered Mr. Cunningham while drinking beers at Memorial Park. Correction: the time *Marlee* had been drinking beers at the park. It had been during summer break, a month before school started. I’d been too wrapped up in agonizing over my SAT score to take a sip of beer until Marlene rolled her eyes and shoved a joint into my hands.

“You’ll be fine,” she said. “You always are. Here, drink up.”

After taking a few drags of the joint, I had to admit Marlee was probably right. I’d done all I could on the test; now I just had to wait for my results. I leaned back against the grass and stared up at the plum blossom trees surrounding us, my worry fading away under the weight of the perfect, velvet summer day. I could hear, somewhere in the distance, the gleeful shrieks of kids playing tag or hanging from the monkey bars in the playground at the bottom of the hill. I didn’t want this summer to end. This time next year, the three of us would be on our separate ways to college, scattered across the country from one another.

I sat up to snag one of the beers, thinking vaguely that we should go to McDonald’s at some point, and caught movement out of the corner of my eye. A very familiar figure was walking up the hill towards us, two six-packs of Guinness beers stuffed under his arms. “Shit! It’s Mr. Cunningham!” I stubbed out the joint and frantically examined the scattered beer cans surrounding us. “Oh my god, what if we’re suspended? Or expelled?”

But Marlee just laughed and waved at him, an impish grin on her face.

“What are you doing?” I hissed, close to hyperventilating. “Do you *want* us to get caught?” I could already imagine my life after getting expelled from Harker: constantly scrabbling for jobs without any chance of finding steady unemployment, unable to ever move Mom out of the shitty apartment we currently lived in. It wasn’t like Mom’s job paid that much money. Even if she’d never said so, even if she’d never once put the expectation on me, she *was* relying on me to get her out of there.

Mr. Cunningham strolled towards us. In a T-shirt and jeans, he looked about ten years younger than his actual age and cuter than ever. If it wasn’t for Mom’s storied dating history, I might have developed a crush on Mr. Cunningham too. But I’d learned earlier than I wanted to that getting attention from men in their twenties, when I was still a teenager, wasn’t flattering but creepy as hell. Myron was just one example that leapt to mind.

He glanced briefly at our beer cans, his mouth curling into a smile. “You guys look like you’re having a good time.”

“We are,” said Marlee. “Any chance you’d want to join us?”

I threw her an appalled look. I didn’t understand why she was being so bold; if Mr. Cunningham told the school administration about what he’d seen here, we’d be kicked out of Harker faster than you could say “underage drinking.”

But he just shook his head and laughed. “I’m good,” he said, jerking his head towards the beers he was already holding. “Should I ask how long you’ve been here? Or would the answer horrify me?”

I opened my mouth to respond, but Marlee jabbed her elbow into my side without ever looking away from him. “The latter. But if we leave before you come back, will you promise not to tell anyone you saw us?”

“Sure. It’ll be our secret.”

Marlene saluted him with the beer she was holding, still smiling. “Here’s to keeping secrets.”

*Here’s to keeping secrets*. Looking back on it, it had been so obvious. And I’d missed it anyway. But when I tried to reconcile the smiling, laidback version of Mr. Cunningham we’d encountered in the park with the version I had in my head of Marlee’s murderer, I drew a blank. Could he really have done it? Could he have pushed one of his students to her death?

There was only one way to find out. I needed to find evidence that Mr. Cunningham had been the one corresponding with Marlee. And if there was any evidence, I felt confident that it had to be on his phone. Of course, checking it was easier said than done; it wasn’t as though I could simply saunter up to his desk and snatch his phone out of his hands.

Luckily, I didn’t have to think up a solution by myself.

**Chloe:** I need your help

**Chloe:** I need some way of getting into Mr. Cunningham’s phone

**Chloe:** Pretty sure he’s who Marlee was dating.

**Colton:** ???????????????????????????????

**Chloe:** Think about it!

**Chloe:** I mean, she spent so much time with him after school

**Chloe:** Called him by his first name

**Chloe:** Talked about keeping secrets with him

**Chloe:** Who else could it be?!

**Colton:** uhhhhh I don’t know

The speech bubble appeared and disappeared several times, as though Colton kept deleting and retyping whatever he meant to say. “Come on,” I muttered, tapping my fingers impatiently against my thigh as I headed towards my first class. AP Lit wasn’t until third period. “Hurry up, Colton.”

**Colton:** seems like you’re jumping to conclusions again

**Colton:** sorry

**Colton:** but I’ve got ur back

**Colton:** what do we do?

**Chloe:** Still figuring that out

**Chloe:** I’ll keep you posted.

\*\*\*\*

For the first time since the school year had started, I looked forward to my AP Lit class. But once I was actually sitting in the classroom and directly across from Mr. Cunningham, doubt rose inside of me. I wasn’t expecting anything out of “The Tell-Tale Heart,” but if he had killed Marlee, shouldn’t there have been some sign of it on his face? He seemed the same as ever though. The cool teacher who occasionally swore, the one who seemed to *get* it. Who understood what it’d been like as a teenager, and who was on our side.

Instead of paying attention to his animated lecture on *Troilus and Criseyde*, I stared at his phone, trying and failing to think of some way to get it out of his reach. It was an iPhone, similar to the one Marlee used to own, but beat up and scuffed, with cracks across the edges of the glass screen protector. If I could just get into it, I was sure I’d find something incriminating.

The bell rang, interrupting my thoughts, and I shoved my half-completed homework assignment into the black plastic letter tray. As I walked out of the classroom, someone tapped me on the shoulder and I jumped about two feet into the air. Chelsea stood behind me, her red-gold hair brilliant under the sunlight. “Sorry. But we need to talk,” she said.

This close to her, I noticed the dark circles under her eyes. And there was something in the way she held herself, her shoulders hunched, as though she expected someone to leap out at her at any second. I cleared my throat. “Uh, this isn’t really a good time for me. Maybe we could, like, talk next week or--”

“It’s about Marlene.” I gaped at her. She couldn’t have said anything else that would have surprised me more. Chelsea had never gotten along with Marlee, even when we’d been dating. I remembered the countless fights we’d had over her, and how Chelsea had once said, her eyes red-rimmed with tears, *You’ll always care more about her than me.*

I was going to be late to Physics, yet again, but I didn’t care. I texted Colton to join us and we both followed Chelsea as she wound her way through the campus and around the groups of other students. She led us straight into the girl’s bathroom opposite the art classroom, the one that no one liked to use because it only had three stalls and constantly went out of order. Colton balked at the threshold until I rolled my eyes and yanked him in after us. When we were inside, Chelsea even checked the stalls to see whether or not anyone else was there.

After satisfying herself that we were alone, she took a deep breath and said, “This is going to sound completely bonkers. But I...” She fiddled with a strand of her hair, unable to look at either of us directly. “OK, you know what? I’m just going to say it. Two nights ago, I got a call from an unknown number and someone who sounded a lot like *Marlene* was on the other end of the line. I know that it makes zero sense, and it was probably just a prank call, but I keep getting these fucked up nightmares--”

“Us too,” I said, cutting her off.

“You...too?”

Before I knew it, I found myself spilling all of it out to Chelsea, telling her about our phone calls from Marlee, breaking into her parents’ house, and finding the hidden phone under her bed. I even told her my suspicions about Mr. Cunningham, and how I was sure that he had been the one dating Marlee. She listened to me with her eyes wide and concerned, but I didn’t see any disbelief on her face. If anything, the more I told her, the more relieved she looked.

When I finished telling her everything, she said, with some of her usual fire back, “So, I’m *not* going crazy. You and Colton both got these calls. But why me? She never liked me.”

“That’s not true!” I protested automatically, before thinking better of it.

Chelsea just *looked* at me. “You guys were the Three Musketeers, remember? Invitation only and no plus ones allowed.” Her voice held none of the old bitterness, only resignation. “You and Marlee never tried to include me. So, why...would...” she trailed off. “Wait a second.”

Colton asked, “What? What is it? What did she say to you?”

“I would’ve told you guys sooner, but I assumed you knew already.”

I made an impatient *go on* gesture. “Knew what?”

“Marlene was pregnant.”

Momentarily speechless, I leaned against the row of sinks next to me to steady myself. Colton looked equally shocked, and neither of us spoke for a minute. Several questions came to mind, and it took a while for me to find the one I really needed to ask. “Did she say who the father was?”

Chelsea was already shaking her head before I’d finished speaking. “No. I met her at O’Connor by accident. I went to visit my nana, and I saw Marlene sitting on one of those metal benches lining the walkway to the front entrance, you know? She was crying and--and I nearly walked away anyway. But she was there by herself. So, we talked and she told me she was waiting for someone. She kept saying wanted to keep it, but he didn’t want her to.”

Holy shit. I paced around the tiny bathroom, unable to stay still. I still didn’t entirely understand why Marlee hadn’t told me, but it all made sense now. Of course, Mr. Cunningham couldn’t have let her keep their child; even if the relationship had been consensual, a teacher-student relationship was illegal in California. He would’ve lost his job, faced criminal charges and potential prison time. He had the perfect motive for murder. “Chelsea, I need to get into his phone somehow. There’s gotta be something between them on it.”

I waited for her to argue with me, to tell me that I had to think twice about what I planned on doing. But instead, she simply nodded. “Right. How are we going to do that?” She saw the look on my face at the word “we,” and straightened up from where she’d been leaning against one of the stalls. “I might not have liked Marlene very much, but no one deserved to die like that. So, what’s our plan?”

“Uh,” I glanced at Colton, but he didn’t offer any help. “We’re still trying to figure that out. I mean, he takes his phone everywhere with him; it’s practically glued to his hand. And even if I could get ahold of it, I don’t know his passcode.”

“Yeah, but it’s an *iPhone*. It’s probably synced to all of his other Apple devices. Use his MacBook.”

I blew out a breath, running a hand through my hair. “Okay, fair point, but that brings us right back to the same problem: how do I even get into his laptop? I won’t know the password.”

Chelsea gave a half-shrug. “He keeps all his passwords written down on a piece of paper in his desk. Anyway, if you get into his classroom fast enough, that’s not even an issue. The screen doesn’t lock right away.”

“Right. We need some way to draw him out of his classroom. Something urgent enough that he’d want to leave immediately and forget all about his stuff and about locking his classroom door. Something he really cares about...something like...”

We exchanged a look. “Like his 2005 Ford 5T?” Chelsea suggested. “He’s always going on about how much he loves it. I could tell him someone vandalized it. I’m sure that would get him running out of his classroom fast enough to forget all about locking the door.”

“That wouldn’t give me much time though. As soon as he saw it was okay, he’d head right back, wouldn't he? Unless it was actually vandalized.” If he caught me keying his car, I’d be expelled. No doubt about it. I imagined again, just as I had on that long ago summer day, my future if I never graduated from Harker. If this went onto my permanent record, and I wasn’t able to attend college, it wouldn’t just be me impacted, but Mom too. My grandparents.

Colton had been pale and silent this whole time, letting the two of us talk, but now he spoke up. “Do you guys even hear yourselves? You’re talking about this like it’s some kind of a game. But if he did murder Marlee, he’s dangerous. He’s not going to just let you walk out of there if he catches you.” I tried to interrupt him, and Colton just kept going, raising his voice to drown me out. “And now you’re talking about vandalizing his car? That’s a fucking misdemeanor! You’re really going to throw away your future like that, Chloe?”

“I don’t hear you making any suggestions,” I retorted, infuriated by his condescending tone. “At least I’m *trying* to do something! Do you even want to catch him?”

He looked stung. “Of course, I do! She was my best friend. But so are you. You gotta see how dumb this plan is--we shouldn’t try to handle this by ourselves! Let’s go to the police.”

“You’re the one who said that there’s no point in doing so! We don’t have any proof! If we go to them empty-handed, they’re just going to dismiss us.”

“Yeah, but--”

Chelsea interrupted our argument. “Look, as charming as this little tete-a-tete is, we’re running out of time, and personally, I want to keep my GPA at a 4.0. Stay or don’t stay, Colton, but I’m with Chloe.”

“Obviously I’m staying,” Colton said tightly. “And helping. But *someone* had to point out how stupid this is.”

I turned to Chelsea, so grateful that I could have cried. “Do you think you guys could lead him out of the classroom? And stall him for long enough that I can finish checking his laptop?”

\*\*\*\*

A few minutes before the lunch bell rang, I claimed a headache and slipped out of Physics early, heading straight towards the staff parking lot. I might not have known much about cars, but Mr. Cunningham’s car was impossible to miss; it had been painted a bright red with white stripes down its nose. It looked ridiculously sleek and beautiful next to the other teachers’ cars, as out of place as a swan in a brood of ducklings. He must have saved up a ton of money to afford it. I went over to it, darting quick glances over my shoulder to check for any other students.

I slashed open the rear tires first, then deliberately dug my keys into the painted surface of his car. I made a series of four horizontal lines across the hood, wincing at the screech of metal against metal. Right as I finished up the last line, the lunch bell rang; there’d soon be dozens of students rushing out of classrooms and milling around nearby. I ducked behind the next row of cars and walked in a crouch until I safely reached the auditorium.

**Chloe:** Done

**Chelsea:** OK. We’re heading over to him now.

**Colton:** this plan is so dumb

**Colton:** srsly, let’s think of something else

**Chloe:** Too late

I arrived at Mr. Cunningham’s classroom just in time to hear Chelsea say, sounding genuinely distraught, “You need to come right away! Someone vandalized your car!” I had to jump back from the open door to avoid getting bowled over by Mr. Cunningham as he bolted from the classroom. Colton followed closely behind him, and Chelsea trailed after them both, giving me a quick nod: *all set, go for it.*

I sprinted into the classroom and threw myself behind his desk. He’d taken his phone with him after all...but his MacBook was still here, and Chelsea had been right. The screen hadn’t locked yet. Hopefully she’d been right about him syncing his phone to his laptop too. I opened up the Messages app from Finder, my mouth dry with anticipation. Marlee had sent her last text to “Heathcliff” on November 15, 2021, and I went straight to that date, scrolling down the contacts list and scanning through the assorted text messages.

Marlee’s texts weren’t there. Fuck.

I checked his iCloud next, drumming my fingers impatiently against the desk. Luckily, he was still logged in, which meant all I needed to do was wait for the screen to load. It seemed to take eons instead of seconds, and I was uncomfortably reminded of the many glaring holes in our plan. I had maybe ten more minutes, at most, before he’d return, and no idea if that would be enough time.

When the screen finally loaded, I scrolled down to November 2021 and saw--

Absolutely nothing. I scanned it one more time, disbelieving. He could have deleted all their texts, maybe, or used a different phone that wasn’t synced to his MacBook. Or...or maybe it really hadn’t been Mr. Cunningham. Coming up with this stupid plan, keying his car, jeopardizing my future--had it all been for nothing? I went to close out the tab, my mind frantically racing, still attempting to make sense of it all. There had to be something else I could try. Something else I could find that would be equally incriminating.

*Use that big brain of yours to think*, I imagined Marlee saying. *What do people do on phones when they’re in relationships? They call each other, send each other texts, stalk each other’s social media, and...*

I navigated back to the iCloud homepage and clicked on the Photos icon. There were a handful of different folders on the sidebar. I had that same feeling I’d experienced the day before, when I’d searched Marlee’s house; the sense that there was something important I was on the verge of discovering. So, I kept scrolling past the innocuous photos of dogs, food, sunsets, and hiking trips, clicking through each folder, and scanning its contents until I reached an untitled one located inside another folder titled “Nature.”

The photos loaded. And my breath caught in my throat.

Dozens of Marlees looked out at me from the screen. He’d taken so many photos of her, some of them featuring her partially undressed in the girl’s locker room. And when I kept going, I found photos of some of the other girls in my AP Lit class, all of them unaware of the camera. I swallowed down the nauseating wave of horror. It was like feeling the soft dirt at the edge of a cliff crumbling away under my feet, sending me tumbling down onto the sharp rocks below. There was no question now in my mind as to who had killed Marlee. He had done it. I’d taken Mr. Cunningham’s classes for almost two years, and for the past seven months, he’d been sitting at his desk smiling at us while Marlee rotted away in a pine casket.

*Alright, Chloe*, I told myself. *You have your evidence.* I drew in a deep, shaky breath. I’d call the cops and hand the laptop over to them. They’d have to act then.

“Chloe? What are you doing?”

I jerked my head up to see Mr. Cunningham standing in the doorway of the classroom. His eyes traveled from the phone I was holding to the still-open laptop on his desk. Slowly, he shut the door behind himself and walked further into the room.

“N-nothing. I mean, I had a question about, um, the presentation next Tuesday. But you weren’t here, so I--”

“Were you the one who keyed my car?”

“No!” I said too quickly. I stood up, hoping that he couldn’t tell my knees were shaking, and aimed for a nonchalant tone. “I should get going. Lunch is almost over and I like still have to get to Social Studies--”

We stared at each other, the expression on his face cold and remote as he advanced towards me. I knew I had to keep the desk between us, but the problem was that it had been pushed up against the wall on the left side. I didn’t have anywhere to go. If I went around it, he’d grab me. If I went over it, he’d grab me. The seconds ticked away, each one of them counting down to the final timer, and I had no idea what to do.

I couldn’t have told you how I realized he would leap at me moments before he actually did so--only that something in his expression gave it away. He ran towards me with his arms outstretched and his mouth turned down into a terrifying grimace, and I tore open my backpack, spraying its contents onto the ground. I had pepper spray in there somewhere. Front pocket. Side pockets. No, back pocket. *Where the fuck was it?*

I found it just in time. In one smooth movement, I raised it and jammed my thumb over the button. Mr. Cunningham shouted in surprise and tried to get his arm up to block the pepper spray. He only partially succeeded. I didn’t bother waiting around to see if he’d recover; I vaulted over his desk and weaved around the rows of desks towards the door. One of his hands swept down my back as I ran past him, seeking purchase, and I barely held in a scream.

I reached the doorknob, twisted it, pulled the door open an inch--

Pain exploded in the back of my head. I involuntarily let go of the doorknob, my eyes watering. He’d hit me with something, and now he dragged me backwards by my hair. No matter how hard I struggled, I couldn’t get free, and every step was agony. I had enough time to think, *I’m so sorry, Mom*, and then his hands were closing around my throat and I couldn’t breathe.

Black and purple spots swarmed the edges of my vision. I tried to pry his fingers off my neck, scratching at them futilely. In response, he lifted me off my feet and turned me around to face him. The tendons stood out on his neck, and his eyes were bloodshot and watery from the pepper spray. I tried to scratch at his face, but my arms weren’t obeying my brain’s orders anymore; they’d gone limp and the world was dimming, the tide of unconsciousness drawing inexorably closer.

There was a loud bang. And abruptly, his grip on my throat loosened. I dropped to the floor in a heap, too weak to raise my head more than a few inches. I couldn’t stop coughing, even though it hurt my throat worse than ever. Chelsea knelt down next to me. “Oh my god! Chloe, are you okay?”

Finally, I managed to rasp out, “I’m fine. What happened?”

“We realized something had gone wrong when you never responded to our texts. We came over and as soon as we opened the door, Mr. Cunningham dropped you. He didn’t even say anything to us, just shoved us aside and ran for it. Colton went after him. Are you *sure* you’re okay? You need a hospital.”

“Photos,” I said, ignoring her last question. “On his laptop. Of Marlee and other students.”

Chelsea looked sickened. “Oh, gross. Hold on Chloe. It’s going to be alright. He’s never going to hurt anyone ever again.”

I closed my eyes and let myself believe her.

\*\*\*\*

Even though we lived only a few minutes away from Harker, Mom insisted on leaving work early and picking me up. And she hustled me into her car after telling the police officers I’d be at the police station tomorrow to make my statement. She kept throwing me concerned glances while I stared out the car window unseeingly. “Are you okay, honey?” she asked, reaching out to stroke my hair, as if to reassure herself I was still there.

I nodded. I felt oddly numb, like someone had shot my entire body through with lidocaine. I’d thought that after catching Marlee’s killer, I’d feel triumphant, vindicated. And although I *was* relieved--Mr. Cunningham would never take another non-consensual photo of a student again--I didn’t seem capable of feeling anything else. What I really wanted, I realized, was to talk to Marlee one last time. But aloud, I only said, “I’m fine.”

“Let me cancel dinner with Stephen. What we need is a night in, just the two of us. Maybe I could go to 99 Ranch Market and get us some zòngzi? Or I could go out and bring back some pearl milk tea...” She rattled off a string of different comfort foods.

“Seriously, Mom. You don’t have to worry about me.”

“It’s my job to worry about you,” she said. “I know you’re an adult now, but I’ll always be here for you, Chloe.”

I turned to look at her. She smiled back at me, her eyes bright with tears. I’d wanted so badly to get an adult’s advice, to bring this problem to someone who’d take me seriously and know what to do next, but I’d never once considered reaching out to her. “Thanks, Mom,” I said quietly.

After we arrived home, I headed straight to the bathroom, wanting nothing more than a long and hot shower. The bathroom mirror showed me the finger-shaped bruises around my neck more clearly than I wanted it to. I frowned, touching the skin there gingerly. My throat still felt hot and swollen, and I knew Mom would insist on visiting our family doctor.

I turned to hang up my towel on the bathroom hook. When I turned back, Marlee stood behind me in the mirror. I screamed and knocked the mug holding my toothbrush to the floor, where it shattered into pieces. One shard cut open my left big toe, but I didn’t even notice the pain. Marlee was unmistakably dead; her neck still jutted unnaturally to one side, throat discolored, while her hair dripped with water. Her eyes were two glassy marbles. She raised both arms to her face, clawing bloodless grooves down her cheeks, and screamed, a piercing shriek that drilled into my ears. As soon as I turned around to check whether or not she was actually standing behind me, she vanished from the mirror. I stood stock-still for a few seconds, my heart pounding with terror.

*Something’s wrong.*

I left the bathroom, the shattered mug still on the floor. “Mom,” I said, my voice still hoarse and raspy. It hurt to speak, and my voice was barely louder than a whisper, but I pressed on anyway. “Mom, I need to talk to you!”

“Just one second,” she called. “Come over here, Chloe, there’s someone I want you to meet.”

Slowly, I walked over to the living room. Mom and a man I’d never met before were sitting on our small, worn living room couch, holding each other’s hands. He wore a blue button-down shirt and had messy brown hair. He already looked better put together than most of the men Mom usually brought home. She must have let him in while I’d been in the bathroom. I stared at them both, unmoving, feeling as though I was in another nightmare. One where I couldn’t move or speak or scream. *Something’s wrong, something’s wrong, something’s wrong...*

Mom still hadn’t noticed anything amiss yet. She turned to me and said brightly, “This is Stephen! You guys will get along great; I just know it.”

He stood up from the couch, looking both embarrassed and pleased. “It’s nice to meet you, Chloe. I’ve heard so much about you.” He reached out with his hand to shake mine, smiling, and that was when I finally saw it.

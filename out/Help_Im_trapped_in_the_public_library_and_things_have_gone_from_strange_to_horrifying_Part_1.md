I love reading. I love books, words and literature in most forms. If it can occupy the deafening drone inside my mind, then I'm ready to glue my eyes to the pages. That's why I spend so much time at the public library.

The library isn't that big, it's just about what you'd expect to see in a town like Ridgewood. When you walk in - there is a children's section to the right, the adult section straight ahead and various study rooms to the left. The librarians have a break room and I'm certain there's a sort of "back room," where literature deemed inappropriate or perhaps even controversial is kept.

After an exhausting day of yard work, I decided to spend the rest of my evening perusing the well stocked shelves of the library. Upon entering, there were a few other people presumably partaking in the interest of knowledge through words on paper. A group of students seemed to be studying at one of the circular tables, there was a young woman sitting by herself near a window, a couple were meandering between the aisles being a bit too loud and there were a plethora of lone individuals like myself.

The library didn't stay open incredibly late; it usually closed around 9 PM and it was roughly 7 PM when I arrived. I'm what you might call a "regular," so the librarian greeted me by name, "Good evening Damian!" She was a sweet elderly woman with glasses, short light-grey hair and a soothing voice.

I smiled in her direction, "Hello Mrs. James! I hope you've had yourself a pleasant day!"

"It's been just fine Damian, thank you. What brings you in tonight, looking for anything in particular?" She asked warmly.

"No ma'am, I thought I'd take a look around and see what 'pops' out at me!"

"Oh! Well, I do hope you find something truly captivating!" Mrs. James has a certain inflection on her dialect that always reminded me of a southern belle. Maybe she was one when she was younger?

"You'll be the first to know Mrs. James! Now, if you don't mind…" I trailed off as I smiled again and walked away from the front reception.

Mrs. James's debutante demeanor flowed through the air behind me, "Take care and try not to get lost!"

I wondered how I could ever get lost in a place like this. She was probably just teasing me because as I mentioned before - the library is relatively small. I avoided the children's section and went straight to the back. It just so happened that the couple was there as well and now they had resorted to using the obscurity of the shelves as a PDA concealer. However, they did stop when they noticed I was nearby.

At first glance, nothing was catching my eye. I ran my fingers along the bindings and scoured the titles diligently. There were books on physics, hydroponics, botany, medieval war strategy, architecture and even spatial discovery. Obviously, I was in the nonfiction section but I'll read fiction too; it just depends on what piques my interest.

And there it was, the book I'd read that night, the one book that outshined all others - a biography on Leonardo da Vinci. Now, I know what you're thinking, "What the hell? Really? THAT'S the book you chose?" While I might be inclined to agree with you, something I failed to mention was that I'm a history buff and Leonardo was the subject of most if not all of my character studies when I was in school. 

But, I wasn't planning on checking the book out. In fact, I simply wanted to do a bit of quiet reading to help calm the incessant mental storm in my mind.

As I emerged from the back of the library, I noticed that most of the patrons had gone. The young woman was still sitting by the window and a few of the lone individuals were wandering but other than that; it was me, them and Mrs. James. The elderly librarian smiled at me when I flashed the book cover at her and I found a table to sit at.

I opened the book and delved deep within the pages. I hadn't read this particular book, so I was curious on what discrepancies it may have versus the knowledge I already had of Leo's life. For some reason; it had all sorts of new information! There were things that a part of me wondered if historians even knew! I found myself completely enthralled with each individual letter as if it were a story all on its own.

You know what they say? Time flies when you're having fun. I soon realized I had forgotten to pay attention to what time it was and as I forcibly averted my eyes from the book, I noticed it was past closing. Why hadn't Mrs. James said anything? Everyone else had gone and it seemed to be just me, myself and the horrendous droning of ambient library noise which is essentially the absence of ALL noise but sometimes silence is deafening.

Before panicking, I checked around. I thought that perhaps Mrs. James had a mental lapse and if I left without anyone noticing, then there wouldn't be any problems. My only issue though, was that the entrance was gone.

I don't mean like, the door was missing or anything like that. The reality was that a solid wall stood where the front door used to be as if it had never been there. I've been in this library more times than I can count, so there was NO way I could have somehow made a mistake.

The realization with the door was only exacerbated by the fact that I suddenly noticed all of the windows were gone as well. There was nothing but a solid wall in every spot that once had a view to the outside world. 

I thought I might have fallen asleep and promptly pinched myself. The pain that shot through my arm confirmed I hadn't (unless I could suddenly feel pain while dreaming.) So there I was, standing in the middle of the public library with not one soul to be seen.

Maybe it was a prank? A sort of "trick the bookworm," kind of thing. I tried to force myself against the solid wall that replaced the entrance in case it wasn't real, but that only caused an uncomfortable throbbing ache in my shoulder. The wall was harder than I imagined and certainly not fake.

I really was trapped.

This is where my instincts kicked in and I broke the golden rule of library etiquette by shouting, "Hello?! Is anyone here?"

I waited for a response but none came. The only sound was the faint clicking of what I presume was an air conditioner. I started to wander and kept inquiring into the open air, "Where is everyone? This isn't funny! Hello? Is ANYONE in here?!" If the sound of my own voice could equal another person then I'd no longer be alone but unfortunately that's not how the world works. Then again… how could I ever deign to speak on the inner mechanisms of the universe and the world when I'm stuck in the public library?

How could I have not noticed things changing around me? Was that book really so captivating that it prevented me from witnessing the alteration of time and space? A cold shudder flashed through my veins as every synapse in my brain exploded like fireworks on the 4th of July. Too many thoughts flooded my mind all at once like, 'What will I eat? Do the bathrooms still function? Where will I sleep?' And many more.

I continued to let my mind seize control over my critical thinking skills and not in a good way. Luckily, I meandered past a drinking fountain and just so happened to tap it upon impulse revealing a water spout. The water looked clean and I subsequently tasted it and much to my satisfaction; it didn't taste bad.

So the water dilemma was solved but that still left the second most important issue - food. I could do without a comfortable place to sleep, hell, I definitely wasn't short on reading material to help me FALL asleep, but none of that would matter if I starved to death.

It was then that I realized something astounding and it was another moment of undeniable confusion. The library had doubled, perhaps even tripled in size.

Now there were several new branching wings that were entirely unfamiliar and the original layout had been warped to accommodate the new additions. I did call out for help again, but the result was the same and in terms of definition - that meant I was insane. Could you blame me though? Naturally I'd want to be saved, or did I? Books and writing and words were my passion and now I was surrounded by a veritable treasure trove of untouched pages with NO ONE to bother me.

Maybe this was a good thing?

Something about this place twisted my mind; it made me disregard my primal survivalistic priorities for a sense of hobbyist comfort. But I was blessed with a good head on my shoulders and although things did not seem in my favor, I was still standing strong.

However, one of the newly emerged wings was almost… calling me. I felt an overwhelming urge to explore it as if the equivalent to the fountain of youth lay somewhere along its shelved corridor. And before I knew it, I was putting one foot in front of the other right towards that wing. It had to have appeared for a reason and it was so oddly placed; it extended diagonally from the middle of the back wall (where I originally found the biography) and took a sharp left turn a ways down.

As I stepped into it, I heard a faint but familiar noise. The sound of an office chair creaking as weight compressed it. There was only one place I knew of that had a chair and that was behind the front desk. Then, I heard the sound of the wheels under the chair rolling against the short carpet.

I was not alone.

I crept slowly between the now towering bookshelves in order to get close enough to see the desk. It seemed further away than it should have been, but as it came into view, I felt warmth, comfort and salvation.

It was Mrs. James, Well, she was facing away from me, but her short hairstyle was unmistakable even from the back.

I approached her quickly and rested my palms flat on the desk. "Mrs. James! You have no idea how glad I am to see you!"

There wasn't so much as a twitch from her. She said nothing, did nothing and for all intents and purposes, she seemed frozen (although I couldn't see her face.) "M - Ma'am?" I asked softly and still, no reaction.

It was then that I broke another rule of library etiquette. I walked behind the front desk.

I must have missed her movements because Mrs. James was facing away from me again. Now she appeared to be looking out into the library. Was she ignoring me? Then I thought, "Maybe I'm dead…" But that wouldn't explain the other phenomena.

"Mrs. James, are you okay?" I inquired further and she still said nothing. She didn't even seem to be breathing if I stared hard enough. I took the initiative and gripped the back of her chair, spinning her around in one swift motion.

It shouldn't have been possible. Somehow, she was still facing away from me. I spun the chair and saw nothing but the back of her head. But then… I realized…

That WAS her head.

Her entire head was a copy of what it looked like if you were walking behind her.

I stepped back and found myself at a loss for words. What could you say anyway? There I was, standing mere inches away from an entity that carried a certain sense of familiarity but was aberrant on all accounts. I felt even more alone and even more terrified with the knowledge that this… twisted version of Mrs. James would now be free to fuel my nightmares while I was trapped here.

I continued to create distance between me and… her. In fact, I slipped inside of the office area where the employee break room was. While one horrifying manifestation sat just outside the room - a triumphant discovery awaited me within. Vending machines, of all kinds, lined the walls.

Trail mix, candy bars, protein bars, chips, drinks and even a machine for an assortment of random things like medicine and earplugs. I had no idea this many vending machines would be necessary for a small public library but if recent events were anything to go by then this current library was anything BUT ordinary. That meant that these machines were likely another aspect of this unorthodox version of Ridgewood library. Still, my food dilemma was resolved.

Well, as long as I could find a way to get the items without paying.

I wasn't hungry at that moment, so I reluctantly left the room only to find Mrs. James had disappeared.

Standing still, I looked across the now absolutely massive and ever expanding library for any sign of her, but there was none. Now it seemed the library had quadrupled in size, and I noticed something else too.

Someone or something had been moving and stacking books.

Mrs. James perhaps? It's hard to say. I hadn't witnessed her actually move and I was completely unsure of her motives or intentions towards me. For all I know, whatever she IS could be the whole reason why I'm trapped here or… it could be something else entirely.

With the knowledge that a fear-inducing version of the former librarian was wandering somewhere in the library, I chose my steps carefully. I found another new section that had comically large encyclopedias all pertaining to seafaring vessels and the lore of Star Trek (strange I know) but the books were big enough that they gave me an idea. I would build a book shelter to at least feel somewhat protected from whatever may be lurking amidst the pages.

It didn't take me long but man were those books heavy. I took a glance in one but despite the title on the cover - the contents within were written in a garbled language I couldn't recognize. So, I stacked them. I made high book walls in a stray corner and found even LARGER ones to use as the roof. It was about as comfy as comfy can get with a house of books.

To add the finishing touches, I went to the children's section of the library which luckily remained the same despite so many other aspects changing. Once there, I snagged several cushions off the chairs people would sit in to read comfortably. After I laid them down in my book fort; it felt complete and I felt safe.

But safe, I was not.

The entire time I was constructing my peculiar literature-based hovel, I had that uneasy feeling of someone being in the room. Like I was being watched.

I covered my fort entrance with the large book I decided to use as a door and tried to sleep. Although I was actually quite comfortable, I just couldn't shake that feeling. So I left my shelter and headed back to the vending machines; it was about time I ate something anyway and I had no idea what time it was since there were no clocks.

Fortunately, Mrs. James wasn't sitting in her chair behind the front desk, so I slipped into the lounge uninterrupted. When I actually studied the machines, I noticed they didn't have any defined slot for money. Upon learning that, I typed the code for a small pack of trail mix (which was D6) and the machine promptly dispensed it. I did the same thing with one of the drink machines and received vitamin water.

I sat in the lounge and enjoyed my quiet meal if you could call it that while still remaining vigilant for anything going on outside of the room. Luckily, I was undisturbed and although the food was measly, I still felt satisfied (at least the drink was nice.)

After I finished, I walked out of the room and stood behind the front desk. I gazed out into the library shuddered at the thought of Mrs. James being somewhere I couldn't see. I shifted my eyes to the left and then the right and then left again. 

But I did a double take because the young woman, the one from earlier, was sitting by where the window should be.

I gasped to myself and froze in place. She didn't seem to notice me or care for that matter - her eyes were fixed on whatever book she was reading. I took a breath and mustered the courage to call out to her, "H - Hello?"

She turned a page and continued to read.

I came out from behind the desk and approached her, "Miss? Can you… hear me?"

She turned another page, but I noticed something odd. She had this deep-red line around her neck as if it had been cut.

When I reached her, I tapped her shoulder. "Ma'am? Are you okay?"

The moment I finished my question, I was suddenly away from her almost like I had been teleported. I was now the same distance away as I had been before I started to approach her.

While I tried to collect myself, the woman began to move. She closed her book, set it down and then slowly turned her head towards me. There was the sound of tearing skin and popping bones emanating from her entire body like she was recovering from rigor mortis.

She kept turning her head and her body until she was facing away from me. When she had fully turned around, she arched backwards like she was about to do a gymnast tumble except she stayed in that position. Her head hung down and her wrists twisted before she started to crawl towards me.

I took a step back and bumped into a bookshelf. She continued to twist her body in impossible angles and the sound of her bones breaking was tooth clenching. Just as I was about to run away - her head separated from her shoulders and thumped against the floor. Her body kept crawling despite her lack of cranial direction and I watched in horror as her head started to roll on its own.

The head came straight for me and I stepped out of its way. There was a maniacal and all too malevolent smile spread wide on its face. The crawling body bled profusely and soaked the short carpet but it remained steadfast in its pursuit of me.

I sprinted away all the while hearing the sound of the head tumbling across the floor and the quickly distancing echo of the body's bones cracking. I nearly got lost weaving through the ever changing bookshelves and came around a sharp corner to be met face to face with Mrs. James.

She was standing in a corner, arms at her sides and still looking as if she was facing away from me except the front of her body was towards me. I jumped and gasped, almost having the wind knocked out of me from fear alone. Mrs. James didn't move and I didn't either until I heard the horrifying sounds of that devilish exorcist-esque terror fastly approaching.

I ran away again. I ran until I thought the coast was clear and when I did, I returned to my book shelter. I all but threw myself inside and pulled the large book door over the entryway.

I was sealed away from the nightmarish thing lurking between the shelves.

I'm writing this all down in the event that I never make it out of here and I'll be sure to update you soon, hell, I'm not even sure anyone will ever see this... For now, I'm going to put my phone away because the disembodied head rolls by my shelter every couple of minutes and it only takes another couple for that decrepit crab walking body to follow.

I hope I'm not discovered.

The hardest part about this fucking quarantine is the lack of human touch. 

I can *see* my son and his family. I talk to them on the “Face time” every day.

But my granddaughter is six years old, which means she’s changing all the time. Just a couple of days ago, I asked if she wanted me to read her the Mulan picture book she’s always enjoyed.

She shrugged. “Not really. I don’t like Mulan.”

My head spun. 

It takes longer to recover from that than it used to.

“Are you okay, Grandpa?”

“Yes, Malosi,” I lied. “When did you stop liking Mulan? I thought she was your favorite princess.”

She looked away from the camera, bored. “I don’t know. Since forever, I guess.”

Children are eternally frustrated by their perceived powerlessness over the adults in their lives. They have no idea that their ability to devastate us is absolute.

Later that night, I left the book in the attic. I keep a box up there. It’s filled with things that I don’t want to throw away, but am perfectly aware that I’ll never use again. My son will likely put that box in a dumpster after I die.

I'd been part of her life for 1,913 consecutive days before it suddenly became to dangerous for a person as old as me to be around his family. It was certainly hard for all of us.

But they had moved forward.

I had other books, though, and was very grateful she hadn’t outgrown *Where the Wild Things Are.* Hell, *I* hadn’t outgrown it.

She was by herself in the bedroom, almost ready to go to sleep, when I noticed the man in the corner.

My heart rate skyrocketed. The wild rumpus had just begun; I couldn’t afford to stop reading.

“Grandpa? Why are you breathing funny?” Malosi asked in confusion.

The curtain fluttered.

Fuck.

A floor-to-ceiling curtain hung next to her bed, and it was unmistakably hiding the form of a tall figure. 

As I watched, a weathered hand grabbed the edge and pulled it closer in a clear attempt to hide itself.

He was *listening*.

I could not let him know that I’d seen him. My granddaughter’s life depended on it.

But my pulse would *not* come down.

Fuck it. I’d lived bigger lies than this.

I cleared my throat. “Malosi, when someone gets to be my age, they’re proud just to be breathing at all!” I chuckled.

She didn’t laugh.

But I sounded completely calm, even if my heart wouldn’t cooperate.

I was sweating when I got to the part where the monsters were begging Max to say, declaring that “we love you so.” I had one eye glued to the man in the corner, yet was giving an Oscar-worthy performance.

But time was short.

I could *not* tell Malosi to get her parents. He’d grab her before she left the room. I was using my cell to speak with her, and I didn’t have a computer or a landline (“you’ll never need it,” my son had said before pressuring me to cancel the service), so there was no way to call for help.

I had to keep her on the line.

The curtain rustled again. 

The man was getting antsy.

And why not? He was clearly waiting for her to go to bed so that he could strike. The only thing in his way was my bedtime story.

My pulse quickened. I felt like I was floating. 

I had a bottle of Sectral in my bathroom. It wouldn’t fix my heart – nothing would, because there’s no warranty on body parts that will eventually burn or rot – but it *would* calm me enough to get through the next few minutes with a clearer head.

But I’d have to get up and walk to the bathroom. I’d have to break my concentration.

The toe of a dirty, black boot slid out from behind the curtain.

I didn’t have time for Sectral. 

I didn’t have much time at all.

“And,” I crooned evenly, “it was still hot.”

I didn’t want to close the book, because that meant my plan was finished. I had nothing left.

I closed the book.

A bulge rolled down the curtain. The man was running his fingers along the fabric, itching to get out.

Malosi yawned. “Do you have one more story, Grandpa?”

I swallowed. “I – I’m not sure where my *Mulan* book is, so-”

“Okay,” she sighed. “Good night.” 

She reached forward to turn off the phone while the curtain behind her twitched.

“Wait,” I instructed calmly.

She paused.

We don’t choose the hand we’re dealt, that’s for damn sure. But when you’ve only got one card left, you *play* it like you’ve got the keys to the goddamn kingdom.

I closed my eyes, breathed out, then opened them and stared directly at her. “Malosi, you need to listen very carefully and not waste a second. There’s a man behind your curtain who’s about to come out and hurt you. Don’t call for your mom or dad, because there isn’t time for them to save you. *You need to focus.* Close your eyes. Be happy. Relax. What makes you shine the brightest?”

She blanched.

Then she closed her eyes.

“Malosi?”

“Last year, Mommy and Daddy took me to the Florida Keys, and we went to an island where we were the only people. Daddy told me that I could be princess of the island as long as we were the only ones there.”

Pain ripped across my chest. I was supposed to have gone with them, but my doctor restricted travel on account of my recent hypertension diagnosis. 

They went without me and had the vacation of their lives.

A hand with dirty fingernails pulled the curtain back.

I projected calm.

“You *are* a princess, Malosi. Remember that.” I smiled.

A man emerged from the shadows. The phone shook as my hand trembled.

“Is he behind me, Grandpa?” she whispered.

“Yes,” I answered in a voice that was barely audible.

He was wearing a black fisherman’s had that obscured his face. A long trench coat covered most of his body. His filthy hands were the only exposed flesh.

I forced a smile. “You remember that you can be a princess, you can be whatever you want, and no one can tell you any different as long as you don’t believe them. You understand?”

His boot hit the ground with a *clunk.* 

She froze.

“Malosi. *Do you understand me?*”

*Clunk.*

She blinked once, pursed her lips, and nodded. 

Then calm settled on her face, and she smiled.

“A girl is a princess if just one person who loves her says so. Do you see that? You will *always* be a princess to me, Malosi.”

*Clunk.*

“Always.”

A peace came over her, and in that moment, it would not have been realistic for me to ask for anything more.

I drew in a shuttering breath. I realized that within a few seconds, I had watched her grow up just a little bit. 

And I lost a small piece of myself to the mundane reality that we approach the end by dying in parts.

*Clunk. Clunk.*

“Now,” I ordered softly. “You need to meet this, Malosi. It’s not fair to ask this at your age, but I can’t stop it now.”

She smiled calmly.

*Clunk.*

Then my granddaughter stood up, turned around, and faced the man in her room.

He reached at dirty hand toward her as she closed her eyes.

Then she kicked one leg out, her pink sock connecting against his knee with a sickening *crack.* The man screamed as his leg bent sideways and he pitched forward.

Malosi raised a fist into the air. His momentum brought the full force of his fall into her tiny hand.

He bounced off like a bottle rocket, sailing across the room and crashing against the opposite wall. Shattered plaster spiderwebbed around him, and he collapsed to the floor in a heap. Broken drywall and dust swirled down to cover the man, but he lay still.

He probably wouldn’t be moving much at all in the coming weeks, considering his heel was nestled against his ear.

*“Malosi!”* my son’s voice screamed from downstairs. Frantic footsteps followed.

My granddaughter collapsed to the ground, breath heaving as her eyelids closed. “I’m *really* tired now, Grandpa,” she slurred.

“It’s okay, I promise,” I responded meekly, my voice tiny and faint. “It’s okay. You did wonderful. You’re safe. You’re safe.”

Her head lolled to one side. “That… was very hard. Please, Grandpa,” she sighed. “Please don’t make me do that again.”

My son’s footsteps raced through the hall toward her room.

“It’s okay, I promise,” I said through a smile as I wiped my eyes. “I promise that you’re safe.” I took in a deep, rattling breath as the bedroom door flew open.

“You can rest easy, Malosi. You’re part of a very, [very special family](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/).”

3am, and we've just gotten back from the bar, I was drunk as fuck. shots, beers, guzzling, chuggling, gettin' crunk. You know how it is. I almost pissed my khakis, but I didn't, remembered to piss on the wall outside. Hell yeah. If you're reading this you can go ahead and yell "woo!" if you know what it be, and where it's at. My friend Tommy was driving this nice green pick-up truck,it was fucking nice. Woo! Got mad at me for throwing up all over the side of the door, but, whatever dude. It's like, I'll wash it. My boy is trippin', for real. Anyway, I was mad hungry, so I'm like all like, 

&#x200B;

"Tommy, we gotta get some food, bro" 

&#x200B;

"yeah sure man, you got money" 

&#x200B;

"You know I got that mad cash bro, but like, tomorrow, I'll Venmo you" 

&#x200B;

"Kyle, you said that last time" 

&#x200B;

"Broooooooooooooooo" 

&#x200B;

"Fine man, shit, we'll stop by the Taco Bell" 

&#x200B;

So, we driving, Tommy, I gotta say, is a bomb-ass driver. Smooth sailing if you know what I mean. You know what I mean! Fist bump! Anyway, we see that big purple bell, "the big ding dong" as I like to call it, hell yeah. So we pull up into the drive-thru, but none of the lights seem like they're on, just a small red fluorescent bulb somewhere in the back of the restaurant, bro, dude, it was like mad eerie. Spooky time, damn. Tommy's all like, 

&#x200B;

"Hey, kyle, I think it'..."

&#x200B;

"Yes, what can I get for you gentlemen on this fine evening" 

&#x200B;

I laugh "Bitch, I ain't no gentle man, I'm Kyle" 

&#x200B;

"Dude, shut the fuck up" Tommy punches into my arm, not cool bro, not cool. 

&#x200B;

"My apologies" the voice pauses "Kyle, what can I get for you this evening" 

&#x200B;

Hell yeah, time for some much-needed grub action. "I'd like two burritos, with like lots of cheese, and sour cream, and then one of those doritos tacos" 

&#x200B;

A pause. 

&#x200B;

"Ayy, bitch, did you hear me, I want some burritos" 

&#x200B;

"We are out of the burritos this evening, can I interest you in the special?" 

&#x200B;

"Yeah whatever" I reply. 

&#x200B;

"And what about you Tommy?" the voice asks.

&#x200B;

"Hey, how did you know my name?" Tommy asks, and he's all like concerned and shit, should've seen his face, it's all like "duhh, how do the taco people know my name" like, bro, they're taco people. They know everyone's name that's, like, their job. Fucking goofball alert. beep beep, ding ding. Anyway, he ends up getting the special, too, because I guess that's all they had. Taco Bell, more like, Taco, umm, fuck, Taco umm, Taco Smell, lol, ahhh. 

&#x200B;

Okay, so here's where it gets a little weird, I don't even remember eating the special or what it was, I just woke up with this red flourescent bulb hanging over me, there was no kitchen, just faintly illuminated gray walls, I tried to move, but I was chained by my ankle to the ground. At first, I started to panic, but then I was like, ya boy kyle knows what's up, it's time to get kinky. What bitch wants some of this action? I could hear footsteps somewhere so far away, pacing, purposefully. I didn't know where Tommy was, but I assumed he was getting his dick sucked. My man, Tommy! But then I heard it, I'm not one to get scared, I'm a tough dude, but that scream, and that gurgling, not like party gurgling after too many shots (woo-hoo), but like, it sounded oil in a shitty engine, the person didn't sound okay at all. And when I tried to take a breath, it smelled like shit and iron. Not like, bad, but like, you know, like real shit. Like when you walk into a porta-potty that hasn't been cleaned in a while. 

&#x200B;

A metal door creaked open, and there was this man, and he was wearing some cheap ass taco mascot suit, it clearly hadn't been washed in years, and was tattered so that you could see his bare leg, and a bit of his ass. brown stained the front of the suit where this stupid grin was etched across the cloth. If I wasn't close to shitting my pants, I'd laugh at the pathetic display. The man stared at me, I couldn't see his face, but those blank cloth eyes bore into me, knew me, explored me, so intimately. I felt, in a way, violated, by this stupid fucking mascot. Bro, dude, it was not cool. Like, super not cool. 

&#x200B;

"Hi there pal, I'm glad you decided to stop by my restaurant" 

&#x200B;

"Your restaurant, this is Taco Bell" 

&#x200B;

"What? Taco Bell, no, no, no. You've made a mistake I'm afraid. This is Taco Bill's" 

&#x200B;

"The fuck?" 

&#x200B;

"Yes, we get that all the time, we also get 'ahhhhh', and 'please don't', and 'help me, dear God', as it happens" 

&#x200B;

I didn't say anything, I didn't want to give this fucking creep anything to be proud of. Anything that would show that he had made me as scared as I know he wanted me to feel. Motherfucker. I hated this guy. 

&#x200B;

"Ah, well, I'm Taco Bill, and this is Taco Bill's" he smiled "Not very creative I know, but my name, as you can probably guess, is Bill, and I found this old taco suit on the side of the road one day. So, why not? Hey, why don't I give you a tour?" 

&#x200B;

He walked over to me, so casually, each step he took like he had a fucking day to do it, I don't know each small sneaker step on the concrete reverberating in my ears. I tried to struggle when he came over, but it was no use, it turned out I could barely move at all, he undid my chain and pulled me up. There was no use trying to avoid him, and maybe if I cooperated I could get out of this mess. As we walked down a corridor I could feel things start to get hotter. 

&#x200B;

"You feel that," Bill remarked "we're getting closer to where we do the cooking. mm mm mmm" 

&#x200B;

I couldn't just feel the heat, I could hear the screams that echoed from just beyond my view, raspy women's voices, stamping, pleading. Only muffled by the whirring and clanging of mechanical equipment. Metal on bone, and then on to metal again. We made it to, the end of this hallway, and I'll tell you, I was pretty much out of woo-hoos and bros at this point, your buddy Kyle, was already defeated. I admit that I wasn't prepared, even then, for what I saw. 

&#x200B;

a room with what looked like a large grill, larger than any grill I'd ever seen in the back, emanating an orange glow. And there was my friend, Tommy, Chained up just like I was. His arm arms had been cut to reveal his radial and ulnar bones, sharp chopped, and protruding from him, blood-stained, milky white daggers. He flailed them around, they weighed 100 lbs to him, and he drooled on himself. Snot and tears running down his eyes he croaked 

&#x200B;

"Bro, this is so not cool, like dude" 

&#x200B;

Dude, it was not cool. It was very not cool. And I threw up on the ground, you would have too, shut the fuck up. 

&#x200B;

"Well, there it is, that's how we get the meat for our special" Bill said with an inflection that suggested I might be happy and surprised by this horrible revelation. "Your friend isn't ready yet, but I'll let you try a bite" 

&#x200B;

I didn't want to fucking try a bite, this sick piece of shit, I knew he was going to kill my friend. I knew I was going to die. But it didn't matter, before I could do anything a fork filled with meat slid past my lips, Bill's white-gloved fingers caressing my lips, wiping off the bit of spittle for me. I wanted to spit it out out, but he held his hand there, so it sat, and I chewed and swallowed. 

&#x200B;

Okay, bro, dude. You're not going to believe this, but it was fucking awesome! Like damn, bro, you ever eat man-meat before, shit's like, chef's kiss, muah, the bomb, fucking ayy. I could eat this shit every day. 

&#x200B;

Taco Bill could see the glee in my eyes, and he spoke to me. 

&#x200B;

"I can tell you like it, Kyle, tell you what, I can let you work here, and you can eat all the special you want, you just have to do one thing for me" 

&#x200B;

"Bro, whatever man, what's that?" 

&#x200B;

"Let me take out one of your eyes" 

&#x200B;

"Dude, whatever, can I get like a cool eye patch like a pirate. arrr" 

&#x200B;

"Of course, Kyle" 

&#x200B;

So he took a knife, and carved it around my socket, blood poured down onto my cheek, and my depth perception got that much worse, I could see from my right eye the optic nerve as he carved into it releasing my eyeball from its former home. He handed it to me, and I popped it into my mouth, chewing greedily. 

&#x200B;

So, anyway, bro, I've got to get back to work. But like, if you're ever in town, come by Taco Bill's and make sure you ask for the special.

It's been raining outside for 3 days without the sun in the sky. All the gloominess can be felt on the roads and streets. Heavy rain caused a lot of floods in the narrow areas which makes it hard for the citizens to go outside.

All day I just sit next to my window and read the book ***"The Doors of Perception"*** Books are knowledge and knowledge is power, One of the reasons which kept me hooked on books. Even the newspapers are not even fun these days because of their false perception of the virus. So ridiculous? But gave me enough things to think about and kill time. 

My parents don't bother or talk to me these days nor do I see them much. I used to visit my best friend and enjoy drinks and a game on weekends but he doesn't even answer my calls or his front door. 

I have had these cup noodles and chips for the last few days and even this shit makes me feel sick and nauseous. I don't bother to ask for food or medicines. The thing which keeps my interest is someone I liked since my childhood or maybe my first crush who lives across the street. I can see her room's balcony from my window and whenever the weather is different from the deadly summer, she sits out on a chair and drinks tea or coffee. The glimpse of her smile made me happy even in the darkest hour.

It's been 3 days since I've seen her out there on the balcony or ever seen any one of her family. She has this little sister who always used to ask me for chocolates every time I visited her house, and her dog used to go all over me with some excitement, All he used to ask me to pat him or a gentle rub, and  I thought about going in for the lunch and offer them some noodles which I don't think is a good idea all but thatâ€™s something I could do at least. I had some leftover chocolates that I happened to save to eat later on but I think I should take them for her brother. 

I rang the bell once but nobody opened the door and then twice, twice. All I could hear was the loud television noise but I had no idea why they were not opening the door. I remember that they had this window from which she always used to sneak out due to its broken lock and we used to go out to the park and play with the others. I went inside from that window and there I saw everyone on the couch sitting and watching the old classic "legends of the fall" I loved that movie since childhood. I was thinking of giving them a surprise as I went inside and shouted SURPRISE!! 

I was expecting a scare but it was more like a blank reaction. So there we settled to sit and eat together I was just as happy to see them but they were not that happy may be due to the "surprise" I gave them or they were not expecting someone to play this kind of stalker move. I offered them the noodles and served them on the table while I shouted RICKYY! as he always used to come even from far away whenever I shouted but this time he didn't that was very odd but anyways, I offered the chocolates to Sara but she didn't seem happy or taking any of it So, I just kept them on the table maybe she could have it later on. 

We all were watching and eating and I just couldn't stop looking at Jessica's smile as her eyes staring the television screen her big glowy hazel eyes were just like the ones you see in those old films with all that bokeh and softness. Finally, the movie ended and we all finished eating.

I started giving goodbyes to them and that was one of the most unexpectedly happy moments I enjoyed in a while. 

The only thing which bothered me as I was going out and thinking about why their house smelled like a dead rat had been there for days and no one bothered to clean it or talk about it. I don't think it should matter.

After all, I was the only one breathing.

THE END.

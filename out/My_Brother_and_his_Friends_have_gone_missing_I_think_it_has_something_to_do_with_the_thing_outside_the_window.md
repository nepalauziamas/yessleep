Hi! So um, four months ago, my little brother Bee and his friends went missing. We still haven’t found them yet, but I found one of my brother’s notebooks and the things he wrote in it might explain his disappearance. I typed up what was written in the notebook before giving it to the police.

I’m hoping that you guys might be able to help me find my brother and his friends. Please. My mom is heartbroken and my little sister Isabelle was inseparable from him.

If anyone has any information about what might have happened to them, please let me know.

Um hi, my therapist said to try journaling to help with my anxiety so here we go, I guess. There’s been some strange things happening. I’ve been seeing something outside my window, and I keep hearing things in the woods. I can’t quite describe the sounds I hear, but they sound almost like skittering in the bushes and faint, distorted voices. The thing I see though… it scares me. It looks kind of like a deer, but it’s face is messed up. It’s almost like it’s been stretched out and bent, kind of like tapir’s face almost. But it doesn’t have eyes, and its neck is weirdly shaped. It’s longer than it should be and it has several odd bends in it, almost like it's been broken several times.

Now, I should be telling this to my therapist. But I’m worried that I might have to go back to the mental hospital if I do. I’ve already been there once for trying to overdose, and it was awful. They treated us horribly and threatened to hurt us if we did something they didn’t like. Now, I know that if my mom knew about how I was treated there, she’d do everything she could to make sure that I didn’t go back. But I live in Florida, where I can be Baker’s Acted. So, none of us really have a choice if they decide to send me back.

Anyways, my friends are coming for a sleepover. I gtg.

Oh my god. Oh, my fucking god. It was really there. The deer-thing I kept seeing, I thought it was just my imagination or some sort of hallucination but it was really fucking there.

Me and my friends (Michelle, Nicki, Arlo, and Rose) were just fooling around. We decided to go look around in the woods beside our house. It’s not that big, so we weren’t worried about getting lost. My older sibling tried to talk us out of it, saying that we’d get in trouble and we could get hurt. We told her that we wouldn’t do it, but we waited for her and my mom to go to sleep. There was my little sister, but she was busy playing Minecraft in her room.

I don’t know how we ended up where we were, we were following a small animal trail that was in the woods. Somehow, we ended up a bridge. This didn’t really make sense because the only bridge near our house was about a mile away, and it didn’t have any doors under it.  We figured we had just wandered a bit further than usual and figured that we’d just never seen it before. After all, it wasn’t that big of a bridge. It barely even had any water under it, just a few puddle here and there, And the ground was covered in cement. Kind of like those man-made canals you sometimes see. We saw the doors and decided to go see what was on the other side of them.

God, if we had just gone home or listened to my sister, this never would’ve happened. It all went to shit once we opened those doors.

We placed a big rock we’d found in the doorway so it didn’t close on us. We had our phones so if we did get stuck somehow, we could call for help. Once we got inside though, the door slammed shut.

“What the hell?!” Arlo yelled, “We just put a rock there, how the fuck did it close?”.

“I don’t know” Nicki said, trying to open the door.

“Damnit!! It’s locked!” she said.

“What? How? I’ll go ahead and call my mom” I spoke, a little spooked. Although I figure she was just messing around.

When I she picked up however, there was this staticky screeching sound.

“The fuck was that?” Rose said.

“I don’t know, probably just my little sister playing a prank though” I said, sighing. “I’ll call mom again”

Before I could do that however, Michelle spoke up.

“Hey, guys! What’s that outside?”

When I looked out the small, grated window and saw what she was talking about, I froze in terror.

“Um guys, are you seeing the weird deer thing that I’m seeing?” I asked, my voice trembling.

“Y-yeah”, Arlo said, “What the fuck is that?”

“I’m not sure but I’ve seen it a few times at night before” I whispered.

Suddenly, the thing rammed into the door.

Nicki screeched and Michelle yelled “Get back!”

That things face was pressed against the window from the outside, growling loudly. I frantically tried to call my mom again, but she didn’t pick up.

“Come on come on!” I yelled, trying again.

Just then, Arlo screamed.

The thing was squeezing through the window.

“What- what the hell!?” he was yelling.

It shouldn’t even be able to fit through, that window was only a 6-inch by 6-inch space.

I ran to the door, finding it unlocked but it was stuck. I managed to pull it open and we ran. 

Michelle screamed. I looked back to see it rip her in half. Before I was able to run back, Nicki grabbed my arms and dragged me along while the thing started chasing us. It was clearly faster than we were, but it was staying just behind us. Toying with us.

It bit Nicky by the leg, dragging her back. Rose tried to pull her away from it, but it just rammed it head into her, knocking her out.

“RUN!!” Arlo was screaming.

We ran and he could hear it panting behind us. We saw house lights and when we broke away from the tree line, we were only a few houses away from my home.

My legs were killing me. Even though we hadn’t run that far, it felt like we’d been running forever. We were running up the driveway though, pulling the front door open and slamming it shut. I quickly locked it, and we bolted to my older sister’s room screaming and waking her up.

“What’s wrong?!” she asked.

Me and Arlo were telling her what happened, tripping over each other’s words, almost too out of breath to speak. She went and got mom and they called the police.

It’s been a week and they still haven’t found Nicki, Rose, or Michelle.

It’s been three weeks and Arlo didn’t make it home from school. I tried telling the cops what I saw that night, and that I think the thing got Arlo too. They thought that since it was dark and I was so scared, that my mind had made up the creature.

I’m scared. I think it’s going to come get me too. I can still hear the voices in the woods. Only now, they’re closer. And they sound like my friends.

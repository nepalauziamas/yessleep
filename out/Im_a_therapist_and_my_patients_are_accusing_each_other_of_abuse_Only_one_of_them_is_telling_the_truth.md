They had to be the youngest married couple I've ever worked with.

Her eyes were red with tears.

His eyes were exhausted and defeated.

"I think I should start..." Kierra sniffled through tears. "It's just so hard to ask for help, you know?"

"I understand," I said. "Why don't you begin by telling me what brings you to my office today?"

Kierra took a deep breath and nodded slowly. "He--" she stammered. "He hurts me."

I was surprised to hear Lucas groan from the corner. "Here we go again..."

"Don't do that!" Kierra shrieked. "You promised you would be honest here!"

"So did you," Lucas shot back. "But apparently we're just here to agree that I'm an abuser -- like all of your other *abusive* *exes*, right?"

Kierra let out a loud sound -- a mix between a sob and a shout. "They *were* abusive!"

"Right, and I *saved* you from them," said Lucas bitterly. "Until I became your latest abuser."

"DON'T DO THAT!" Kierra screamed. "You are invalidating and minimizing my experience!"

Good lord…

"Let's just take a step back here," I said, scooching my chair closer to distract them from each other. "Lucas, would it be okay if we let Kierra finish her story? I understand these are extremely serious allegations, but I assure you I will not rush to judgment until I hear your side too, okay?"

He nodded, although his expression was not one of agreement.

"Thank you," Kierra stammered. "It is so hard to speak my truth when he belittles me."

Lucas opened his mouth, but I gave him a sharp look and he backed down.

"Kierra, you just said that Lucas hurts you," I said. "Can you tell me more about that?"

She nodded and her eyes started welling with tears again. "It's a type of-- a type of punishment."

"Punishment?" I asked. "What kind of punishment?"

She winced and whispered, "The Slicer."

"The Slicer?" I repeated. "What does that mean?"

She shook her head and buried her face in her hands. "I don't want to talk about it."

"That's okay," I said quickly. "Kierra, can you tell me more about what leads to this punishment?"

She looked back up. "Yes," she said. "He becomes angry when I call him out on his manipulation."

"What kind of manipulation?"

"It's subtle," she said. "It's called covert narcissistic abuse, and he fits all the red flags. Insensitive to my feelings, never apologizes or admits fault, needs constant attention from others--"

"Oh, for Christ's sake--"

"Just another moment, Lucas," I said, holding up my hand. "I promise we'll get to you soon. Kierra, can you give me some examples of the manipulation?"

"Well, he's bisexual," she sniffled. "And he spends almost all of his free time with his gay friend."

"Do you see what I'm saying?" Lucas turned to me, exasperated. "This is her version of *abuse*."

"Who spends that much time with a gay guy!" she shouted.

"He's my *friend*!"

"No, you do it to punish me!" she said. "It's a reminder that I'll never be enough to fully satisfy you. A warning that if I step out of line, you can always replace me in a heartbeat."

"Has there been infidelity?" I asked.

"No," said Lucas. "I would never--"

"Who knows!" Kierra interrupted him. "He's like your little pet. You parade him around on social media just to make me jealous. You never post pictures of us."

Lucas looked at me incredulously. "Do you get it now?" he said. "Do you see how crazy this is?"

Just as I was about to begin asking Lucas some questions, the door to my office opened.

"Oh, sorry."

A young, awkward looking man in a FedEx uniform stood in the doorway, holding a few brown Prime boxes.

"Your front door was open. I heard voices in here. Wasn't sure if you wanted to sign, or…" He looked around the room, finally noticing Lucas and his tearful wife. "Oh, it seems like this might not be a great time?"

"*You don't say...*" I muttered, standing up to sign for the packages. "Just leave them in the lobby please."

He blushed and nodded, closing the door behind him.

God, I needed an assistant.

"Sorry about that," I said, sitting back down. "I just moved into this office, so things have been a little chaotic. Anyway, Lucas, I'd like for you to share your side of the story now."

"Okay," he said quietly. "Well first of all, I think she might be the one abusing me. She grabs me sometimes."

"I DO NOT!"

"Kierra," I said firmly. "Now we're going to give Lucas a chance to share."

She looked like she was going to explode.

Lucas rolled up his sleeves, revealing a series of bruises. "She grabs me when I try to leave after a fight," he said. "She accuses me of abandoning her."

"HE'S LYING!" Kierra shrieked. "He does that to himself!"

"I'm just really afraid," he continued. "I asked for help on a forum, and a lot of people suggested she might have Borderline Personality Disorder. I Googled it and she has almost every symptom -- crazy mood swings between sobbing and rage... thinks everyone is abusing or traumatizing her… a new crisis story every hour... and I swear to God, any 'slicing' is 100% self-harm."

"More armchair diagnosis!" she cried.

"Are you serious?" He threw his hands into the air. "You just called me a narcissist!"

"Look, you've obviously both done some research on the internet," I said. "But perhaps it would be better if we met separately? That way you each have a chance to share your side, uninterrupted?"

"No!" They both protested at once.

I raised my eyebrows.

Then, at the same time, they spoke nearly the identical sentence:

"*He'll manipulate you*." / "*She'll manipulate you*."

My eyes scanned back and forth between the two of them curiously.

Hysterics versus irritation. Tears versus eyerolls. Slicer versus bruiser.

Were their online diagnoses correct? Was this really the age-old dance between The Borderline and The Narcissist?

Or was one of them lying?

For the rest of the session, I listened to them make more accusations -- and more denials. To be completely honest, I still had no idea what was going on with them. If either of them was really in the Cluster-B spectrum (narcissist, sociopath, borderline, histrionic), it would take far more time to unravel the truth among all the manipulation and gas-lighting.

I actually have an optimistic view of Cluster-B recovery, but it's not going to happen with talk therapy, and it's certainly not going to happen in the midst of a dramatic relationship. That's like asking an alcoholic to begin recovery in the middle of a liquor store.

At the end of the session, I stood up to walk them out of my office. Lucas exited first.

Then, in the doorway, Kierra quickly leaned into my ear and whispered:

"*He's going to kill me*."

I'll admit, that sent chills down my spine. When it comes to domestic violence, you never want to take statements like that lightly. So when I closed the door to my office, the first thing I did was reach for the phone to involve the police.

But before I finished dialing, something caught my eye.

There was a piece of paper sticking out from the couch cushion -- where Lucas had been sitting. I really didn't want them to come back later for a forgotten belonging, so I hurried over to examine it.

But when I unfolded the piece of paper, I didn't find a forgotten belonging.

Instead, I saw a hand-scrawled note:

"*She's going to kill me*."

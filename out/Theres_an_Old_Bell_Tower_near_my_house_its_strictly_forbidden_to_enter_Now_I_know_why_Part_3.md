Part 3.

A scream from above us came only too soon after being hit with the horrifying realisation that we were now trapped with someone or something sinister, stalking us, possibly looking to harm us in some way, I don't even want to think about it.

'That sounded like Liam' Brian said before darting back up the stairs.

'Brian, wait, slow down!' I tried to run up the stairs but my legs were weak.

I got to the third floor only to catch a glimpse of Brian already running up the next set.

'Brian fucking slow down, don't leave me!' I called out, but he never stopped.

I made my way to the next set of stairs to the fourth floor and with legs of jelly, began to haul myself up.

'Brian, wait!' I called again, as I saw him reach the last step. 

He finally stopped and turned to me.

Brian put his finger to his mouth, 'shhhh'.

I slowed down, trying desperately to control my heavy breathing.

I crept up the last few steps.

Liam was sitting in the middle of the landing behind a single candle, the dim orange glow dancing on his face as he stared right back at us with a look of panic in his eyes.

Brian put one foot on the landing, Liam started shaking his head, eyes growing wider, apparently warning us not to go any further.

The candle light extinguished and Liam screamed, we could hear him being dragged away at a rapid speed crying, then silence, silence and darkness.

I felt like I was about to cry, I wanted to go home and be with my Mum and Dad, I wish I never agreed to come here.

Before I knew it I was quietly sobbing and fell to my knees, Brian sat next to me.

'We need to do something Danny, we can't go back down, we also can't leave him'. Brian put his arm round me.

I fell against him 'what if something happens to us? I want to go home Brian I don't want to be here anymore' images of my family raced through my mind upsetting me more.

'I know, so do I' he tried his best to console me, 'Do you not think Liam wants to go home too? he's up there himself, God knows what's happening to him, I can't even make sense of what's going on here, all I know is we can't leave him'.

I dried my eyes 'okay, okay' I sniffed, I always felt stupid crying in front of my friends, 'we need to light these candles again, I have the hammer, and this screwdriver, maybe we should... we should, eat these sandwiches and have a... a drink... or....'

'Danny, Danny, calm down' Brian interrupted, 'we're not eating any sandwiches, we need to go now, get the candles, lighter and the hammer and ditch the bag for now'.

I hastily grabbed the candles and lit two.

Wielding the rusty claw hammer, Brian led the way.

We stepped onto the fourth floor holding the candles out in front, constantly checking side to side, the darkness was deep and surrounded us on all sides. 

Pieces of glass and rocks crunched under our feet as we crept towards the far end.

We reached the wall and eventually followed the wall round to find a door.

Brian pushed it open with the candle hand, hammer raised in the other.

'Seems quiet, come on in' Brian whispered.

I followed close behind, checking behind me before we were fully inside.

This room was a large square, it had an unbroken window on the far end, not boarded up, a small glint of moonlight granted us some solace from the unrelenting pitch black we had just came from.

I felt more at ease seeing the world from the window, seeing the outside, I felt sad, I wished I could just climb out and be done with this place.

Brian was milling around, scouring the room, the light partially illuminated the centre of the room and to a lesser extent the walls but it was still dark.

There were old cupboards and cabinets, Brian was opening them checking inside incase Liam was hiding but there was nothing.

I felt safe in here, there was nothing scary about this room, I didn't want to leave the window but Brian told me to get the bag and leave it in here.

'We'll use this room as a kind of base, if anything happens, always try and make it back here to regroup no matter what!' He said as he opened another cabinet. 

The door came off in his hand. 

Brian threw it to the ground and wandered up to the window. 

'You going to get the bag then?' He passed me the hammer.

I reluctantly took it and went back outside, everything about that room was completely different than what it was like everywhere else, as soon as I stepped out I felt stalked, like I was being preyed on or attacked.

I quickly ran to grab the bag sitting at the top of the stairs.

I put my hand on the strap.

A hand from the darkness grabbed me, jagged black fingers clasped my arm and tightened all the way round.

I looked up and saw Brian's face, smiling with glazed yellow eyes.

He put his finger to his mouth 'shhhhh' 

I felt my arm being pulled and I screamed bloody murder, I dropped the candle and tried swinging the hammer to no avail.

I screamed and cried like I never had before.

I heard a door open behind me, a soft candle glow fast approached and suddenly I was being dragged back into the base room.

'What happened? what was going on? what, what happened?' Brian stuttered in a panic.

I couldn't control myself, I was crying like a baby.

'Danny, it's okay man, I've got you...' Brian trailed off, 'wow, what the fuck?' He said as he lifted my arm. 

There were long slender uniformed burns where the hand had grabbed me.

'It stings, it burns' I was finally able to get some words out, my arm was on fire. 'I dropped the candle, I think we only have one left'.

Brian looked at his candle which had already burnt down about halfway, 'well you got the bag at least, what else is in here?' 

Brian rummaged inside pulling out paper and eventually found my sisters Polaroid camera, 'as a last resort we can use the camera flash if we're stuck, the only other thing we can do is crunch this paper into sort of sticks and burn them if we need.'

'Okay' I nodded, still sniffing.

We started crunching up the paper into baton like shapes and twisted them to make them rigid.

'It'll probably only burn for like 20 seconds, but that might be all we need' Brian tried his best to reassure me as he continued to make paper batons for burning.

We had about 11 or 12 and stuck them in the bag, along with the camera. I kept the screwdriver out incase we had to use that as some sort of weapon too, with the lighter handy in my pocket we rested for a few minutes to try and think of a plan.

'Do you think we need to go up any more stairs?' I asked.

Brian got to his feet as he began talking, 'No idea, we should just go out, follow the wall and see where it leads, if it goes up, we go up, if there's another door we should check inside before going anywhere else, we need to find Liam!'.

I took one last look out the window, wondering if I'll ever see the outside again, I turned to Brian, 'let's go for it then' I said, putting my bravest face on.

Brian lit the last candle and picked up the hammer, the door opened itself as we approached, whatever was on the other side, wanted us to come out.

I wielded the flat headed screwdriver, ready to stick anything that came for us, my focus was on getting out alive, I couldn't be scared anymore.

Brian slowly crossed into the black landing, I had one hand on his jacket and the other holding my weapon in front of my face.

When we had both left the base room, I was on high alert, scanning all around just waiting for something to come for us.

We walked slow, kept our backs to the wall and side stepped the perimeter of the hallway looking for stairs or doors.

I felt on edge with every step, the darkness scrutinised my movements, something was there, something dark and hostile.

I head a thud on wood.

'It's another door' Brian whispered. 

We barged onto it but it wouldn't budge, I saw stairs leading up right next to the door.

'Will we go up?' I asked.

'No, we need to burst this door open, Liam could be right in here'.

What sounded like a sledgehammer smashing the door from the other side startled us both, it was almost coming off the hinges, accompanied by a horrible gargling growl that sounded almost like a lion stalking its prey, but more guttural. 

'Yeah maybe just head up the stairs' Brian said, already turning on his heels to run up.

I followed close behind.

As we neared the top, the banging on the door below abruptly stopped, a rush of air breezed past us.

The small stairwell to the bells was in front of us, the bells were within 4 arched walls, the moon lit the way leading up and we could see what appeared to be shadows, moving around back and forth near the top of the stairs.

There were flies and bugs everywhere, and some noisy crows hanging around the arches.

Two doors on this level either side of the stairs seemed to beckon us inside, faint noises from behind each had us struggling to decide where to go.

'What do we do?' I asked Brian, my voice was shaking to match the rest of my body.

'I don't know, we just check these rooms I suppose, there's nothing else we can do' Brian raised the hammer and approached the door on the left.

The other door on the right creaked open.

'Hey... Danny!' The cold whisper I heard before 'in here!'.

I stopped dead in my tracks.

Brian's eyes widened as he noticed something peeking out from the cracked opening in the doorway.

I began walking over.

Brian grabbed my arm, right on the burns.

'Ow, fuck sake Brian' I pulled my arm back blowing on it.

'Sorry, dont go in there.... just dont'. He stared right into my eyes, he was as serious as I'd ever seen him.

With just a nod of confirmation we continued to slowly walk toward the left door again.

The right door slammed shut in anger.

Brian opened the left door.

The candle went out, we were plunged into darkness again.

Brian swung the hammer up and down and side to side hitting only the air around him.

I crouched down readying my screwdriver for... well I didn't know what for but I was ready anyway.

Brian lit the almost finished candle again, I pulled out some of the makeshift paper candles we made and we lit a couple, the flame was bigger and granted us more light.

As we entered the room, the most foul stench I have ever had the misfortune of experiencing hit me, the room was cold and covered in black stuff, some rotting black sludge, weird figures and trinkets that seemed to be made from some sort of animal parts, the flies in this room were relentless.

The fire on my paper torch managed to light more of the room and we could see Liam lying in a pile of rags and dead birds.

There was a crude circle around him of black and red crystal like stuff. 

I immediately darted over to Liam and grabbed his shoulders, Brian patted his face to wake him up.

He was limp but breathing.

His eyes eventually opened, in the very limited light I could see his eyes were bloodshot, his face was covered in cuts, like slashes and his clothes were torn up.

'Liam get up, we're getting out of here, come on' Brian said, his voice was urgent and demanding.

We threw an arm each over our shoulders and began carrying him out towards the stairs.

Brian still had the hammer, I held out some paper torches to light our way.

We were finally getting out of here!

Liam walked as much as he could, helping us as we were struggling.

I looked up to the bells as we passed, looking at the moonlight, I couldn't wait to get out of here.

'Danny... Brian....' a shout from the top of the stairs.

I looked up.

Liam was lying at the top of the stairs.

'That's not me! Run' He cried.

He was dragged away from our sight, just as the bells began to toll midnight.

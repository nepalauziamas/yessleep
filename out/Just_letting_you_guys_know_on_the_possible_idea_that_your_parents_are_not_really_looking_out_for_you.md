It's a common misconception that your Parents actually are the only people that will ever love you unconditionally, it's the opposite. The child will always long for a father and a mother for the rest of their life, that's why people have such issues when one of the parents is absent, it's never the other way around. That's why usually in marriages everything is done for the child because that love a Child has to their caretaker is truly unconditional, to the point that the child will believe anything that their Parent will tell them.

It's a harsh reality that many people would never truly emotionally comprehend, your parents don't love you. Not at least the way you think they do. Raising a child is a responsibility, it's a chore and it sucks ass. Therefore because it sucks ass, most parents if not all parents actually hate their children and the best parents are the ones who are the best at hiding it. In the teenage years i think many children understand that crucial fact and because so much other shit falls on top of it, like so many lies they were told by their parents and how much life really sucks, after a while a lot of times with the help of their parents, they fall back into that fantasy knowing somewhere in the back of their mind that it is while being in complete denial of it. A lot of people by hearing this will have this narcissistic rage as well, as i have pulled them back into a world that is very far from the world they would like to live in.

People in reality don't really care about each other that much, the whole idea that we do care about each other is only a mere illusion we humans have created through time as by the way humans have survived over the years is through teamwork. The reality is, that humans would evolve with distain from one another once survival wasn't depended on teamwork. Teamwork is merely the idea of moving together as if we are this one independent body, where each individual person in the team does one specific task much like the other one network. The dopamine receptors fire if the task of survival was accomplished. Even though that is true, the wish to be this independent body in each person in that network exists, which means that even though we rely on each other to survive we wish we would be able independently, so then we wouldn't rely on others as that minimises risk and a lot of trouble of miscommunication and dealing also with stupidity.

That is true in every network that includes a family, in a situation where both parents are crippled and are not really pursuing and growing as efficiently as they would be on their own, means that both parents are not that keen on having you there crippling them. As humans also have this competitive nature they have with other humans especially of their class, meaning their age group maybe even amongst their classmates. Of where they feel as though they are losers. That's why most pregnancies are mistakes, because humans evolved preventing self sabotage, as the one who self sabotaged perished and the ones who avoided it survived.

Your parents see you as nothing but a ''thing'' which destroyed their dreams and aspirations and they do blame you for it, because it's a lot easier then to admit being that loser that everyone avoids to be. Your parents therefore when you grow up don't actually want to see you succeed, because that will remind them of how much of a loser they are. I don't know if you know this, but the Father of Elon Musk, actually said on live television with a straight face, that he is more proud of Elon's brother who is present then Elon Musk the richest man in the world. Elon actually cried when he was asked about it in an interview, as you can't imagine how much shit he is going through to make all of the things he is doing possible and yet....

  

“Time’s up John.” I try always to make it my clandestine mission to shut the Casio timer I’ve set for 60 minutes off before the 80’s style alarm rings. I don’t want the patient to hear an alarm signaling the end of their session. They know they are paying for my services, sure, but there’s no need to have such an abrupt auditory end to it.

He scoots up on the couch, using his elbows to move to a sitting position. John wipes his eyes and blows his nose with the same tissue he’s been using for the entire session. As with most sessions, he seems relieved (in a good way,) and thanks me. I say the pleasure is all mine as I always do. And I genuinely mean it. Funny that about 90% of my clients choose to lay down on the couch I have in my office. I never tell them to. I have two very comfy-looking chairs (in my opinion) for their sitting pleasure.

But I understand. I didn’t have to go through over a decade of schooling to understand that when people are laying out their deepest fears, insecurities, pains, and uncomfortable truths, that they don’t always want to look at a stranger when doing so.

I shake hands with John, and he’s on his way. He’s doing well. I cannot disclose what he’s here to talk to me about of course, but he’s come a long way. I can disclose this to MY therapist, Dr. Long. The idea that a therapist needs a therapist is somewhat of a cheeky joke, but I can tell you that most of us absolutely do have our own psychiatrists. It’s a career that I absolutely love and have a burning passion for. Something I’ve always wanted to do. But holy Chimichanga, I’m going out of my Mind-A if I don’t talk to someone about other peoples’ problems. And I get to put my own personal issues out there as well.

Twenty minutes north of a drive in my solid RAM truck and I’m at Dr. Long’s practice. It’s always a pleasant traverse. I work in the city and he’s just on the outskirt of said city. I guess that’s “making it,” when you can have your own private practice in a more suburban area closer to your own home. By the lake. Don’t get me wrong, I’m more than happy for him and he absolutely deserves it. Not only is he my therapist, he is my mentor. He helped me through school, advised me on my thesis, and then agreed to personally see me every Tuesday and Thursday. Not many mentors will do that. He’s even given me the “family discount,” for our sessions. Which is just full price. A joke, I guess. I’ve never got it, but one day I am sure I will. 

On my drive I happened to notice a door with a black cat Halloween decoration on it. “Happy Halloween,” it plainly said. The cat’s face was very grumpy. Ala Garfield, I’d say. I suppose this was the joke, as cats aren’t happy about anything. Nothing out of the ordinary, but.. it’s August. August 1st, specifically. No one puts Halloween decorations out early. And no one keeps them out after. It’s the one holiday that I’ve seen where decorations come the hell down on November 1st. Halloween is the kickoff to the holiday season but it’s like we want to move on to cheerier turkey and Santa related holidays as soon as spooky season is done.

“Hey Sport!” Dr. Long shouts. I almost fell down the three steps leading to his practice. I was so engrossed in the off-season Halloween decoration that I didn’t even realize I was already standing outside his office. 

“Sh-shit, I’m sorry Dr.” “I was just spacing out.” I shook my head, trying to focus up on my therapy session. “No problem at all my boy, you always had some issues focusing at the task at hand!” With this, Dr. Long lets out a huge belly laugh. He knows I graduated near the very VERY top of my class. I was certainly no slouch. Speaking of Santa from before, this guy resembles him to a T. Especially when he laughs. Younger though, his long hair and beard still have a good amount of brown, but they are quickly losing the battle to the white hair army. He’s of course a big man also. The first requisite to being a Santa doppelganger. It still makes me chuckle that it’s more accepted if you are overweight as a Doctor if you are in any field of Psychology than if you are a physician, general practice, or even a surgeon. I know that even I take a pause when I’ve been treated for minor injuries or getting a physical when I see a fat Doctor walk in.

The session goes as it always does. I unload what’s been on my mind from my own clients, and then I tell him what’s been bothering me lately. Usually, it’s working through parental issues. Standard stuff.

It went well. I never get to emotional, just want to shed the bit of weight of what I’ve heard from my current sessions. I don’t know if other therapists have this issue but sometimes, I just have to tell someone the crazy things I’ve heard. And I can’t ethically do that to anyone else in the world. Unlike my alarm clock method, Dr. Long has the hour session down to a science. I can tell when the time is just about up when he takes his glasses off. Unlike the majority of my own clients, I don’t need to lay down on the Freud couch. 

Sitting on the brown leather chair, more uncomfortable than it looks, I start to rise to my feet. “You uh.. want to talk about the pumpkin thing Terry?” I stop myself from cracking an awkward smile. “No.. not this time Dr.” He smiles politely. “I told you Terry, we’ve been colleagues now for a couple years, you can call me Kyle.” I smile back and nod, shaking his hand. “Next time, Dr. Long.”

My real name is Tortoise Maclemore. Odd. I know. My parents were hippies, short answer. Still are, I suppose. They followed that Hindu thinking that the world is on a turtle, or Tortoise’s back. I hated the name as a child. I couldn’t shorten it to Tort, that sounded even dumber. The closest thing I could think of was Terry. Even as a 10-year-old I tried to make that stick, and it did. My parents won’t call me that, but everyone else does. Maybe one of the reasons I went into the medical profession. I wanted to be as far away from their whacky hippy ideals as possible.

I flipped my desktop calendar to October 30th. Less than 20 hours until my least favorite holiday. The whole month of October has held some stress for me. People go nuts during the 10th month of the year. They dress up like ghosts and evil people. They put pumpkins on their stoops and lawns. They cut into the oversized fruit with glee, carving wicked faces of all kinds. Illuminating that face with fire. I guess I associate those damned fruits with some of the worst times of my life.

When I was finishing up my undergrad in Central Michigan University, Fire up chips, I was robbed and beaten pretty badly outside of my dorm room. Just a few years later, as I was finishing my doctorate at PENN state, I was suspended from my internship doing research at the children’s hospital. The official allegation was that some nurses felt uncomfortable around me. To this day I’m not sure what that means. I profess my innocence to this day and never did anything of ill-will towards anyone. No one went missing if that’s what you’re asking.

To take it back to childhood, I got lost inside of one of those mirror mazes when I was about 11. It was at the county fair, during Halloween of course. It seems silly now, but I was really panicking. I could not find my way out of that demon maze. All I could see was myself over and over and over again. The lights kept dimming. My parents.. I don’t know where they went. Probably getting loaded with their dumb hippy friends. I somehow found my own way out, hyperventilating and puking my little 11-year-old guts out. I think I’ve determined this is the moment I wanted to explore how fear and emotion affects us. Being a psychiatrist was the perfect career goal.

Even with my history of awful Octobers, I still don’t know why the pumpkin makes me feel so terrible. Even with a Doctorate in Psychology and Psychology I still don’t have a definite answer. I was never touched inappropriately by a pumpkin as a child as far as I know.

Fascinating too is the term “Jack O’ Lantern.” There are no other names that fruits go by. An apple is an apple, unless candied, I guess. A watermelon is a watermelon. But when a pumpkin is given a carved-out smile, we call it a Jack O’ Lantern. There are a couple different schools of thought as to the origin of this. One is that the early Americana Revolutionaries carried pumpkins with candles inside, making it a cheaper alternative to actual lanterns. The other is that some guy called Jack was taken pity on by the devil. When he died, he was neither accepted into heaven, nor granted access to hell. The devil allowed him to roam earth with his prized turnips. Lighting them to guide others. Weird, I know.

Another session with John. Halloween. He’s doing much better. He’s accepting his upbringing with his parents. It wasn’t as bad as he’s imagined.. “Time’s up John.”

I decided to walk home. I enjoyed the smells of the nearby lake. I thoroughly loved the way our trees have changed into fire-like colors. I didn’t wholly love the kids with pumpkin t-shirts but.. I’ll let that one go.

The jack o lanterns are rotting. It’s time to put them to the curb. It’s December, after all. It’s.. December?

I called Dr. Long. No answer. I left a voicemail.   
 “Hey Dr.-.. Kyle. It’s me. I’m seeing more and more pumpkins. I don’t know what the hell that’s about. I know it’s October and all but.. I think.. no, it’s almost Christmas. Why are there pumpkins still around? I need to get into this with you finally. Text me back when you can fit me in.  Before our usual appointment.”

I’m sitting here in my modest ranch home. Sipping a Canadian Whiskey backed up by a white claw. Girly to some but comforting to me. The nurses at the Penn State children’s hospital loved them.

A knock came from my front door. Metallic in sound. I quickly put my drinks away, don’t want to have that out to see for whomever may be at the door. Oh good, it’s only Dr. Long. Kyle.

“Um.. Dr Lo-. . Kyle.. what are you doing here.. at my home? He smiles his familiar St. Nick smile. Full of warmth and acceptance. He lets himself in, taking a seat in my dining room. He slaps his knees and then motions for me to sit next to him. I do as he motions.

I stared at him for a moment. Probably too long to be called a moment. “You wanted to see me, Terry.” I shook my head, coming back to the here and now. “Um, yes. Yes, I did. I’ve been having some real issues lately. I don’t know why this has gotten worse.”

“What’s gotten worse,” he slowly spoke.

I gave him a look that said you know what’s gotten worse. “The pumpkins, Doc. They’re all over. Usually after Halloween they’re gone. I don’t even know what happened. Yesterday was Halloween, today is almost Christmas Eve.”

He pondered. He crossed his legs, his corduroy pants causing friction that I hoped wouldn’t start a fire in my home. Who wears cords anymore? “Well,” Dr. Long pondered, stroking his brown-ish goatee. I think you can’t comprehend what you’ve done to elicit these pumpkin-demons quite yet. You have to tell me what happened, Terry.”

I squinted my eyes. “What do you mean, what I’ve done. You know me better than anyone. Not even my stoner parents know me as well as you do.”

He laughed. Not a scoff, or an impolite laugh. A laugh that was comforting. He played like he was on my side. “Terry. Tort. Tortoise.” He took a deep breath. That’s the only thing you haven’t made up. I get why you would hate that name.” My blood started to feel like it was slowly freezing. I couldn’t understand why.

He continued. “Most people, men especially, blame their parents, mothers especially, on any little issue that finds their way into their lives. Before I continue, I’d like to ask you one question. Is that ok, Terry?” Again, my eyes squinted, and my nose scrunched in confusion. “Of course, it’s ok,” I stated.

“Ok good.” Dr. Lugo uncrossed his legs and took the “teacher’s stance.” Leaning forward, elbows inside of his thighs, hands clasped underneath his chin. Crazy blue eyes staring at me.

“What happened to those nurses at PENN, Terry.” 

He of course gave me no response, as he’s done every time that I’ve asked this question. I’ve been assigned to interview Mr. Maclemore since his incarceration, and subsequent transfer to the Forensic Center. I had no issue traveling the extra 100 miles every week to see him when he got moved. It’s truly fascinating.

“One more time Mr. Maclemore.. Where are the bodies? You loved them, didn’t you? Or did you feel like they were making fun of you, disrespecting you, making you feel worthless?” I have not gone quite this hard on him yet. His reaction is impressive. I can see the rage under his face, but he keeps his calm. My notetaking is interrupted by a knock at the steel door behind me. Visiting is over, even for professional visits.

“Anything Doc?” the Hulk of a correctional Officer known as Bill asks me. He’s one of the long-time C.O’s here. Seen a lot of criminally insane. “Nah, Bill, same as always.”

I hand in my visitors pass and get my court-ordered paperwork time-stamped on my way out. 

After our initial interview I saw how much he wanted to become a psychiatrist. He was not too far away from that goal. I thought it might help if we indulged his desire and let him pretend that he had led a different life after the implacable “Penn State Nurse slayings.”

Terry’s trial will be starting in about 11 months. It will start on Oct. 1st. A trial of a man charged with pre-mediated first-degree murder. A trial that I’ve tried to prevent. He is guilty. That, I am sure. But he didn’t pre-mediate anything. I don’t know why yet, but those damned pumpkins coinciding with the entire month of October did something to him that we might never know. He’s got a fantastic mind. He regales me with his weekly “sessions,” of his patients. Truly a fantastic mind.

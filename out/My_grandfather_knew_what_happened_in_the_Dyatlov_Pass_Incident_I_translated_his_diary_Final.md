My grandfather commited suicide in 2019. I translated his diary, and found out what he was hiding from us since back in 1958. This is his story.

If you're confused, you should probably start at the [beginning.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/m9zfc8/my_grandfather_knew_what_happened_in_the_dyatlov/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

*February 1, 1959 - continued*

We froze. We'd been awaiting this moment anxiously for hours - but when it came at last, we still hesitated.

"Blow the slope! Do it, Sergei!" yelled Yuri, breaking our horrified trance.

Our commander smiled cruelly, and hit the detonator.

There was a loud crack and a boom, like thunder in the distance. A flash of flame illuminated the slope, casting it in sharp-cut shadow and light. I covered my ears.There was a rumble that echoed across the mountain. 

For a second, the world held still. 

Then the whole slope above the tent began shifting, the vibrations setting off an unstoppable chain of motion. Tonnes of snow were moving, sliding down with an unsettling groaning sound. The mass gained speed.

And struck the tent with horrible force.

Silence fell on the mountain. Slowly, we picked ourselves up. The tension was palpable. We waited with bated breath.

"Did it... Did it work?" I said finally, my voice hoarse.

No one answered for a second, listening intently. Then Yuri whispered an answer. "I think it did," he said. "We should go che-"

A horrifying scream, louder than any before, cut through the night. My heart sank, a chill running down my spine.

Yuri swore, and Sergei drew his pistol.

"Looks like we're not done here yet, soldiers. Get ready."

The tent bulged, and then split as someone tore it open from inside. Figures streamed out, running towards our treeline. They weren't screaming - they weren't taken.

But my heart sank as the last four shapes  emerged from the ruined shelter. Four loud screams sounded across the mountainside once again.

The things staggered through the snow, limbs uncoordinated, as if whatever force gave the bodies movement and strength was not used to these new hosts. But they were moving fast, following the fleeing hikers... and heading straight for us.

"Prepare to fire!" Sergei commanded, his voice cold as iron. "If it moves, kill it."

My surviving comrades kneeled in the snow, rifles trained on the incoming figures. With a crack of gunfire, we fired our first volley. We aimed with all the skill we had, trying desperately to make sure the hikers who hadn't yet been taken wouldn't die in our crossfire.

One of the screaming ones went down, and I cheered, only to curse in fear as his cry of insane pain was raised up by another of the fleeing hikers.

Were these things invincible? 

Would death only make them leap to a fresh target?

Another volley set my ears ringing, and two more bodies fell to the ground. Their screams were silenced only for a second before a pair of the fleeing hikers stumbled, twitched... and took up the agonised cry.

Panic spread through our group like wildfire. Discipline collapsed. The screaming men were getting closer, our gunfire doing nothing to stop their advance. First one, then two soldiers turned and fled into the forest. Then we were all running, terror seizing our minds in a horrible grip. 

We ran through the midnight forest, the screams of the following things echoing around us. 

I cried out as the ground below me suddenly fell away and I tumbled down a small slope. A stream ran at it's bottom, and I fell straight into it, ice - cold tendrils immediately spreading through my body.

My comrades ran after me, some falling as I had, some keeping their footing. Sergei stood beside me, and lifted me to up.

"What do we do?" I said desperately, panic threatening to overwhelm me again.

Sergei didn't have time to answer. Over the lip of the slope we had fallen down, four shapes appeared. Their screams were deafening.

The next moments are only a blur in my memory. I remember desperate gunfire, as the four slavering figures ran among us, their screaming mixing with our own cries of fear and confusion. The corruption spread quickly, men falling dead, others taking up their inhuman shout.

One memory is clear as glass in my mind. A screaming figure, a soldier I had known as Igor Paschenko, staggered towards me, his mouth open in a disfiguring grimace. I stumbled backwards, tripping on a prone body and falling to the ground.

I would've died. I *should've* died. But then Sergei jumped in front of me.

He never panicked. He may have been cruel, a bastard and a murderer, but he never panicked. As Paschenko screamed at him, Sergei aimed his pistol and began firing.

His aim was flawless. One bullet, two, three, almost a whole magazine, dumped into Paschenko's chest. All but one shot. As the soldier fell to the ground, and whatever force had moved his muscles fled to find a new host, Sergei put the gun under his own jaw and fired.

Then Yuri was picking me up. 

"Run Michail! Run! Back to the base!"

I didn't question his command, didn't ask why we would go back there. I fled, Yuri beside me, as the screaming tore through the remainder of our group.

We had gotten away, but the things were soon in pursuit. As we staggered through the snow, we could hear them behind, their agonised cries slowly gaining on us.

My legs burned, weakness and cold sapping my strength. I would've given up and laid down, waiting for death, if Yuri hadn't kept me going.

We dashed through the ruined gate of our former base, the things some one hundred meters behind.

The darkness in the ruins was absolute, and we would've soon been lost if Yuri hadn't quickly found a battery-powered light. 

We ran downards, through the levels of the base, the screaming now closing in behind. If they caught sight of us, this close, it would be the end.

"Where... Where are we going?" I panted, tears of fear and exhaustion streaming down my face. "We're trapped down here."

Yuri's face was set in stone. "We can't kill them, Michail." he answered. "If that avalanche and all the gunfire we hit them with couldn't do it, I don't know what will."

"Then what are we going to do?"

He glanced over at me for a second as we fled through the dark. Then he raised his free hand. Grasped in it were two grenades.

"One of these opens the caves on Level 5. I lure them inside, and I hide. Once they've followed me, I'll sprint out. You have to be ready, Michail. The second I'm out of that cave, you blow the entrance. We'll cause another rockfall."

"We will trap them again," I realized. "We will seal the cave off."

"Exactly." Yuri smiled grimly. He thrust one of the grenades at my chest, and I took it in shaking hands.

We tore into Level 5. The ground was strewn with corpses, the dead left in the wake of the screaming ones escape lying in heaps around us. Our pursuers weren't far behind. I could hear their thudding footsteps, their terrible cries. 

We were running out of time.

Yuri sprinted towards the pile of rubble sealing off the caves.

"Hide! Quickly!" he called out.

I leapt to the side of the room, taking cover behind an overturned worktable. A dead body lay there, it's eyes open in death, a grimace of shock and pain set on it's face forever. 

A loud bang shook the whole level as Yuri blasted his way into the caves. The walls groaned ominously, their structure damaged, thousands of tonnes of rock above us pressing down with terrible pressure.

The screaming ones were approaching. Their cries were deafening. Yuri's light went dark as he pushed deeper into the unseen cave. There was a quiet thud as he lay it down. The bait was set.

We didn't have to wait long.

The cries of the things in pursuit rose in a crescendo as they crashed onto Level 5. They didn't stop, and dived straight into the caverns, following the light.

I leapt from behind the table and ran to the cave entrance. A grenade pin clinked onto the ground as I pulled it out, gripping the safety lever in sweaty hands.

I waited, my heart thudding, my breath coming in short gasps. Desperation began building inside me, as I realized that something must have gone horribly wrong.

Yuri wasn't coming out.

How long could I wait?

How long did I have?

Suddenly, my friend's voice cut through the cacophony of pain, echoing from the black cavern.

"Blow the entrance, Michail! Do it now!" he yelled from the dark.

I couldn't. I wouldn't. My friend was in there, and I couldn't consign him to this death sentence.

"Yuri!" I screamed desperately. "I can't!"

My friend limped into view, staggering around a corner of the passage. Four shapes leapt up behind him, all attention on Yuri. He hadn't been able to hide from them.

We were out of time. Out of options.

"Do it, Michail! You have to-"

He couldn't get any further. I saw one of the pursing bodies collapse. Yuri twitched, staggered and fell.

Tears blinded me. I released the safety lever, and leapt back behind cover.

There was a flash of light and a deafening boom. The screaming was drowned out. The walls shook. 

And the cave collapsed. 

Tons of rock smashed down, shattering on the ground. A cloud of dust sprang up, setting my lungs on fire. I peered through it with watering eyes.

The cave was sealed. A wall of rock had fallen in it's entrance, blocking it off.

I fell to the ground, and wept for my lost friend.

[This is the last entry in my grandfather's journal, except for those last words. *God help us. They're still out there.*]

No dead soldiers are mentioned in the old investigations of the Dyatlov Pass Incident. I presume whatever arm of the government sent my grandfather to that unknown base had gotten there first, drawn by reports of missing hikers, and made sure their involvement would never be found out.

In 2019, the Russian government announced it was opening a new [investigation](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/02/04/europe/dyatlov-pass-incident-scli-intl/index.html) of the Dyatlov Pass Incident. The conclusion was that the accident was caused by an avalanche. I guess they're not completely wrong, or not outright lying.

I think it was this reminder of his past that sent my grandfather over the edge, pushing repressed memories into his mind.

I can't help but wonder if his last written words were true. 

Are they still in the caves?

I wonder if, somewhere out there in the icy Russian waste, buried beneath the Ural Mountains, four men - one of them a hero and my grandfather's long-lost friend - are screaming to this day.

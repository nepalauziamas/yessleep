Me and my twin sister have were raised in a lavish lifestyle. Our family owns many properties and businesses. I’m not sure how much money we have, but it must be in the millions at least. 

Not only that, we’re gorgeous. 

Rich and gorgeous. 

Me and my twin, Amaya, were raised by our servants and our father. Our dear mother died soon after we were born. Over the years, father remarried multiple times. And over the years, father divorced multiple times. He never had any more biological children. Just me and Amaya.

A couple years ago, father re-married to Selena, a gorgeous women of high class. 

Father said she was “the one”

Selena was different from others, she had 3 children which meant me and my sister now have brothers, step brothers. 

Eddie, the musician.He kept to himself, very shy and loved to be alone. However, he wouldn’t mind being with my sister. Gwen, the youngest but the most annoying. He tries impressing us but always fails. And last but not least, my favorite, Kieran, shoulder length hair but kind and attractive! Months went by, and everything seemed alright. Eventually we all liked each other. Amaya had doubts about Selena but eventually got over it.  

“Alexi, I really think Selena only married for our money.” Amaya said with such worry.

“Oh don’t worry so much Amaya, she’s so kind and beautiful. She would never hurt a fly, nonetheless steal from us.” I replied.

Of course, no one is perfect. Not even us. 

“John? John i’m so sorry it was a mistake i promise!” I heard Selena yelling at my father. I was near their room looking for my sister.

“I trusted you Selena, how could you cheat on me? Do you know how this looks? How could you?!”

I suppose my sister was right. Selena never loved my father. I forgot about looking for my sister and went to my room. It was dark anyways so I went to sleep.

The next day was normal. Nothing werid. It’s as if that argument had never occurred. I eventually forgot about it.

That was just the beginning of everything The next few months nothing was normal. Selena would ignore us frequently, spend our father money excessively, and, our father fell ill. Amaya also wanted to dress differently too. She refused to give an explanation. 

“How’s the soup?” Selena asks us.

“Amazing!” Eddie and Gwen reply at the same time.

“It’s alright mother.” Kieran smiles.

“Father?” Amaya had said, we all looked over and we realized how pale he looked.

He starts choking profusely.

“Father!” I yell.

We ran over to him, but it was too late, he had passed away on the dining room table.

Father was dead.

The funeral was held a few days after. 

Many people were in attendance. I didn’t count but I estimate there were around 300 people. 

Although there were many individuals there, It felt as if it was just me, my sister and father. All alone. Lonelier then ever.

I looked around, some people were crying but i couldn’t understand why they were. I bet father only met them once. Maybe twice. 

I looked over to Kieran and Kieran looks over to me. He doesn’t look sad. He looks..okay..honestly I don’t know how to describe him. I shouldn’t expect him to look sad. 

It’s not his father after all.

My father hadn’t written a will, so everything belonged to Selena. 

Including us.

We, Amaya and Alexi, belonged to Selena.

“Alexi?” said Selena.

“Yes Madam Selena?”

“Why is there wine on the floor?”

“But Madam, there is no wine on the floor.”

“Yes there is.” She spills wine on the floor and drops her wine glass. It shatters and goes everywhere.

“Oh, I’m sorry, I’ll clean it up.” I say.

“Amaya, follow me.” Selena ordered Amaya to follow her. I don’t know where they’re going, but it’s not my business to ask anymore.

They leave the kitchen right as I finish cleaning. 

But they do not return.

“Sylvia?” 

“Yes Lady Alexi?” Our maid, Sylvia, replies.

“I’ll be back, okay?”

“okay dear.”

I ran out of the kitchen, looking for one of my “brothers”

I saw Kieran near the library.

“Have you seen Selena? Or Amaya.”

He smiles.

“Hello my lady. Do you know if we’re still “siblings”? You know, since your father died?” He asks.

“I’m serious!”

“Fine, go to your lake, the nearest one. Mother mentioned something about it to Amaya.”

“Thank you.” I say and leave.

I arrive at our lake. I don’t trust Selena to be alone with my sister, especially at night in the lake.

“You know I killed your father, correct?”

Amaya didn’t say anything. I had followed them but I didn’t dare show myself. I simply hid behind a huge tree.

“Do you?!” She yelled.

“Yes.” Amaya replied.

Selena was holding an axe, I don’t know where she got it from, but I don’t think this is good.

“Amaya, my sweet Amaya. My boys love you. They love you more than me. More than their own damn mother!?.” Selena starts to hysterically laugh.

“Madam Selena..”

“You stole my boys love from me. You stole them from me! You are a burden my dear Amaya!!” Selena holds the axe even higher.

“Madam, please!”

I shouldn’t be here. I should interfere. i want to do something, but i can’t. I’m stuck.

“I will kill you, then i’ll kill your sister. I will forget about you and live a life I’ve always deserved.”

My sisters head rolled over right next to me. 

I cried. 

I couldn’t stop crying.

I yelled I screamed. My sister was dead. My father was dead. My mother was dead. I am the servant of my step mother and her children. I have lost all my fortune and I am now worth nothing. 

All because of this monster of a mother.

“Alexi? Who said you can come? I only invited you sister.” The thing was right next to me.

“Mother?” The first and only time I have ever called Selena mother.

I only did it because the monster was my mother. My dead mother right in front of my eyes. I had only seen her in portraits. She was so magestic and beautiful up close.

But the hallucination I was experiencing went away as fast as it came.

“Im sorry, dear, but I am not your mother, or anyones mother. I’m too cruel to be one.”

I can’t stop crying.

She whispers into my ear “I wasn’t planning on killing you yet, but it would be much easier to do it now. Goodbye, Alexi Valentine.”

“No!”

I quickly moved but not quick enough. the axe landed on my thigh.

I screamed in agony. 

I grabbed the axe and from my thigh and tried to stand up, but the pain wouldn’t allow me to.

“Selena, please!” I cry.

I managed to move, but not by much. 

“Give me the axe!”

“No!” I cry and I cry. Today, I cannot stop crying. 

She lets go.

“Alexi, how could you?” Those were her last words. I had taken the axe from her split her head open. I don’t know how she was able to talk, but she didn’t do it for long. The next hours was hell on earth.

I had crawled back to the mansion, blood all over me. All the servants had gone to bed and no one was awake at this hour.

I crawled up the stairs in pain. In fear. I don’t know why, but Imagined Selena following me closely behind. Which is impossible or course. 

Because she’s dead.

I, Alexi Valentine, am writing this at the age of 37. My husband Kieran can testify to the horrors me and my sister went through each day. I know the media thinks I went crazy and killed my sister and step mother for no reason. But that is not true. I would never kill my sister, someone i miss every day, and I would have never killed my step mother, if she hadn’t killed my sister.

Once this is published, I hope my name is cleared. I want all to know the truth. I want everyone to know what happened that night. I wish to live in peace now and enjoy life. 

Thank you, 

Alexi Valentine

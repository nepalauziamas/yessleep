"A body has been found at a house up near town, we have identified the victim as Molly Smith, if you have any information please report to your nearest police station" the news reporter said. It was a bright, sunny day, nearing the end of summer. I had a sip of my morning smoothie. My doctor said that I should drink one each morning, that it would help my brain. I'm not sure if I fully believe him. The smoothies are nice though. As I continued to watch the news my phone rang. It was my doctor, the third call this week. "Hey, what's up? Anything wrong?" I asked. "No no I just wanted to check in with you" he replied. This was a little strange I thought. Usually he called whenever my tests came back or something happened with my mental state. "Uh, I'm feeling fine. No headaches or wierd behaviour this morning" I said. "Oh, OK then, thanks for calling" and he hung up. That was strange I thought. I turned the TV off and got dressed into my work clothes, walked over to my bus stop and headed to work.

It was late at night. He stalked his prey, a young women. Probably early 20's. She was drunk, trying to walk straight. He followed her, quietly, unseen, and waited for the right moment. He checked his surroundings, looking to see if any witnesses would see him. No one was around. He focused on the women. He pulled out his knife. Sprinting at the women, she has no time to react. She drops to the ground, dead. He walks away quietly, unseen.

My head was killing me. This headache was one of the worst ones yet. I took some paracetamol and waited for it to kick in. I turned the TV on, and the news popped up immediately.

"Another young women falls victim to the murderer of Molly Smith. This time, we identified the body as Kate Brown. We advise all people to stay at home during the later hours of the night." The news reporter was saying. Another one? I thought. This was scary. Nobody had ever been killed in my town in recent years, let alone murdered. My phone buzzed. It was my colleague. "Work is now ending at 5 cus of the two people that were murdered. At least less hours, right?" He said. I replied back with a text saying "Wahoo! That means my meeting is cancelled with my boss!" I hit send and he replied with the sunglasses emoji. I checked the time, and saw that it was already time to leave. I grapped my coat, went out the door and headed to work.

Everyone at work was talking about the two girls that were killed. "I feel so sorry for the families of those two poor girls" one women was saying. Another replied saying "Imagine the pain of losing your child". I got a bit jealous when she mentioned child and families. I hurried over to my desk and started to type away, calculating numbers and writing down reports.

He hungers for the kill. She is sitting down, quitely on her phone, waiting for the bus. He wants to kill, watch as the life drains from their body's, there eyes glaze over. Before he can stop himself, he is already beside her, knife in hand and slitting her throat. It satisfies his need for the kill. But there is a problem. A man sees him. He is in a car and already speeding away. Realisation hits him. He has been caught. All this planning, being careful, watching, making sure to be unseen, all for nothing now. He goes home, knowing that it will probably be his last time going back.

"Another young women has been killed last night. Teresa Connors was brutally murdered last night, but we have a lead-" Suddenly my phone rang. It was my doctor again. "Hey, the tests came back... Your positive for Dissociative Identity Disorder". What did that mean? "Sorry what does that mean? I don't understand" I replied back. "It's where you have multiple personalities"  He said. I looked back at the TV. "-and we have a police sketch of the murderer, it should be on screen right now". I almost dropped my phone. It looked like me. It had my short, fuzzy brown hair, freckle face and brown eyes. I looked at myself in horror. It was me who killed those poor girls? How could it have been me? I didn't remember killing them, so maybe it wasn't me. But at the same time... maybe I did kill those girls. And, well, I kinda enjoyed doing it...

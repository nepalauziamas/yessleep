I realized what was happening when my socks were out of place. 

I keep them lined up in Roy G. Biv order in my second drawer from the top (my neuroses make me happy and I don’t care if that’s weird). Yesterday, green was in between red and orange. I would never do that.

It explained the missing food, the stale cigarette odor in my room, and a handful of other things that don’t make sense when someone lives alone. 

I think the worst part was understanding the feeling of being watched while alone in my bedroom. The closet is directly behind me when I’m sitting at the desk; it’s the only place he could have been hiding.

The fucker should have remembered that I’m a chem major. He’d been watching me long enough.

The sulfuric acid was easy to get. Sodium cyanide was trickier, but I have a key to the lab and no one comes in on Fridays. The setup required a bucket and a piece of string slid through the crack in my closet door. 

At first, I wasn’t sure if tonight would be the night. But I’d been sitting at my desk for just nineteen minutes when I *felt* him. The closet door was thirteen feet behind me, yet the space felt full.

Like two people were in my tiny bedroom.

I couldn’t ignore the feeling once it was running through me. Imagine your ears hurting as you sink deeper into the bottom of a pool without knowing which way is up. 

I wanted to run out of the room, but the door is right next to the closet.

So I tipped the dresser on its side. It crashed against the closet door at 45 degree angle, with the edge catching itself on torn carpet.

There was no way for anyone inside the closet to open the door. 

Hand trembling, I grabbed the string. *This isn’t real,* I told myself. *There’s no way a man is trapped inside my room*.

I heard a gasp from the other side of the door when I pulled the string.

I stayed away from my apartment for six hours before realizing that I had to return. What would I tell the police? That I stole chemicals needed to made a poison gas? That I might have killed someone?

No. I had to return on my own. 

The living room felt *off* when I opened the door, but it was too dark for me to see anything. I carefully closed and locked it behind me. For a moment, nothing moved. 

I told myself that I was being ridiculous, that the feeling of pressure in an empty room was just my own neurons playing a trick on themselves. I sighed and turned on the light.

The dead man was surrounded by his own vomit. I could see my dresser pushed neatly against the wall in my bedroom; he had gotten out with just enough life left in him to convulse his way into the next room. 

My world swirled when I recognized him as the dean of student affairs. His uncle was the college president, and the family had a stupid amount of money. 

More than enough to make problems like me disappear – assuming I didn’t get charged for the homicide I had absolutely committed. 

I squatted on the rug, trying to control my breathing, failing to control my breathing. 

I just killed a man.

Consciousness threatened to run away from me as I swayed on my feet.

That’s when I saw the note on the floor. I didn’t think before acting; my brain felt far away. I grabbed it and read.


>I moved your dresser back into place for you ☺. With him gone, it’s just the two of us in [your apartment now](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/).

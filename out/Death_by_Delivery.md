# Part One: Hook

If you live anywhere long enough, you’re bound to see the same faces from time to time. Even in a city of millions, there’s a fair chance of running into someone twice. Or three times. Four times? By the fifth time I’m no longer sure. It’s him again, two spots behind me in line at Stop & Shop, watching me place some apples on the belt. Last time was a week ago at the burrito place across from the library at Brown University. Before that it was at the park while I was walking my dog. He was just sitting there on one of those gross benches surrounded by trash that only people like him seem to use. The first two times were both at Anton’s, while I was picking up orders for GrabNGo. At first I figured he was just another devout Anton’s regular, but now I’m seeing him everywhere and it’s got me out of sorts. I try not to think about it. After all, I’ve seen plenty of weird stuff doing these deliveries; by now I’ve done thousands. 

What started as a side gig after college to make some cash until I found a real job, well… now five years later it *is* my real job. I should probably be more ashamed of my lack of ambition, but to be honest I enjoy the work. It’s passive, predictable, and reasonably steady pay. I don’t have a boss or coworkers. I can work whenever and for however long as I want. And I spend most of my time listening to music or podcasts in the car, or reading while I wait at restaurants. Sometimes people even cancel orders after I’ve already picked them up and I get a free meal. I won’t be living like royalty any time soon, but I know what to expect.

I’ve made quick work of checking out at the store, as not to linger with my observer in tow. As far as I know, he doesn’t know which car in the parking lot is mine, and I think it’s best to keep it that way. I head home for a few hours to eat and rest. It’s Friday and the dinner rush picks up a little after four o’clock. The rent is due tomorrow and I’m a little short, so I need to get a decent haul tonight.

Fingers crossed.

\*\*\*\*\*

It’s now 11:43 PM. Normally by this hour, when I can’t take any more Top 40 radio and my contact lenses have begun to dry out, I would have called it a night. But I’m still twenty-three dollars short on rent. A few more small orders or one really good one would do it, but who am I kidding? By now, all the good orders have come and gone. The catered dinner parties. The sweet old ladies who buy pasta and breadsticks with their grandchildren’s help and tip in cash. Those families with two or three kids out in the suburbs who live in large houses with two front doors; they almost always order the virtually identical twenty dollar “meal deals" at places like Chili’s or Applebee’s. All those people have long concluded their evenings. No, by now all that’s left are the dregs—the final late-night impulse purchases of Rhode Island’s finest: the students, drunks, and creeps. The kids at Brown or Providence College who are so high out of their minds, they’re willing to pay ten bucks for someone to bring them one can of Red Bull and a single white Airhead from the 7Eleven just around the corner from their dorm building. Or those unsavory figures who emerge from crumbling duplexes to collect bottles of liquor which they clearly don’t need and for which I typically get paid a mere $3.75 to deliver. And let’s not forget the creeps. Those who answer their doors clad in unwashed underwear beneath transparent bathrobes, cigarette in hand, and reeking as one does when they haven’t left home for several days. But to serve such clientele is the price I pay for the freedom to work on my own terms, and I do so willingly.

By midnight, I’ve made another fifteen dollars thanks to Abby F. of the West End, who ordered a two liter Coke and a bottle of white rum from Ocean State Wine & Spirits. Eight more dollars to go. One more order, I tell myself. Maybe two, if I get a couple of non-tippers. Most of the street spots are open now, so I’m parked across from a few burger joints and the liquor store—my only viable prospects for business past midnight. 

Five minutes go by. 

Then fifteen. 

Half an hour. 

It’s now quarter to one and I’m about to call it. My phone is down to five percent battery now anyway, and the charging cable in my car is broken. I’ve been meaning to replace it, but I keep forgetting. I’ll just get up early and do a breakfast order before the landlord comes by to grab the check, I decide. I turn the key and start to pull onto Cranston Street when the chime disrupts the silence of the night. An order.

I face the screen and freeze. Across the bottom it reads:

**Pickup:** **McDonald’s**

**$55 (tip included)**

**Emile V.**

*Fifty-five dollars?* 

I wonder for a moment if perhaps I’ve fallen asleep in my car and this is a dream, but a few slaps on my cheek confirm otherwise. Fifty-five dollars is simply an astounding fare. The most I have ever earned on a single order was around thirty dollars—and that was a catering order with five or six bags sprawled across the back seats of my car. This order is for a single cheeseburger combo from McDonald’s at 1:00 AM—with a drop-off only two blocks away. Such an order calls for maybe five bucks, tops.

“Fifty-five dollars,” I say aloud to an empty car. They must be as desperate for fast food as I am for money, I suppose, but I’m wasting time. I crank the stick into drive, head to McDonald’s, order the food, then make my way to the address. It’s an apartment complex. Of course. Though I also live in one, I hate them. They’re hard to navigate, impossible to park in, and the buildings themselves usually stink of weed. But this order is fifty-five dollars. Hell, for that much I’ll feed the entire meal to you one bite at a time and throw away the trash on my way out.

I take the stairs up to the long hallway of the third floor. Half the lights are out completely, while the other half produce something sickly and pale. Fifty-five dollars now strikes me as an impossible figure for someone living in a place like this, but I’m not asking questions.

I knock on the door and wait. Nothing.

I knock again. 

Thirty seconds go by and I’m getting annoyed now. Is this a prank? Has someone set me up to look like a fool?

On the third knock it swings open at once, as if three was the magic number of knocks they were waiting for.

“Here you go sir, have a good ni—“

A sudden warmth permeates my chest. As I raise my eyes to meet those of the customer, I’m struck by a face that I’ve now seen a sixth time. 

*Six times is definitely too many*, I think. 

He drills me with a look of recognition as his lips curl into a grin.

*He knew I was coming,* I think. *Somehow he planned this.* 

But how? Drivers are assigned at random. Did he know it would be me before he placed the order? Or did he keep placing and cancelling orders, waiting to be matched with me? A sweat breaks out on my forehead and I start to shake, but my life may depend on my ability to stand, so I force my legs to keep from buckling in.

Now it’s been a few seconds—*way* too long. I’m sure he’s going to reach for me or follow me if I try to leave, but he just stands there. Staring. Grinning. He doesn’t speak and I don’t wish him to. I don’t dare speak either. In one fluid motion I drop the McDonald’s bag at the door, take a few steps back, and sprint for the stairs. I don’t look back and I don’t stop running until I’m out of the building. How long do I have? Minutes? Seconds? I’m about twenty steps from my car when the thought comes automatically and without hesitation:

*Don’t take another step towards the car. He’s watching you.*

And just like that I know it to be true. He must have a few windows in his apartment, and there is still a chance that he doesn’t know which car is mine. For him to see me get into my car now gives him more information. I drive an old Saturn Ion plastered in bumper stickers—one could easily pick it out of a lineup of half the cars in Providence. To drive it around with him knowing that I’m the owner would give away much of what little protection I might have left. That could be why he set this up. He had his chance to get me, and didn’t take it. I took the bait and nibbled at the hook, but he wasn’t ready to make the catch. Maybe all he wanted this time was information.

No car. So now what? I glance at my phone for a second to see the order still waiting to be marked as completed. The battery is clinging to dear life at 1%. 

*Fifty-five dollars,* I sigh.

The amount feels almost comical now. Much too low a price for such a near miss—for what might have been a brush with death itself. The fact remains, however, that I’m in no position to turn down the money, so I swipe. Then I cash out my earnings, close the app, and watch my phone die. 

*Shit.* 

It’s now quarter past one. I’ve left the car, my phone is dead, and I have nowhere to go. I’ll never make it home at this rate, so I follow my route back towards McDonald’s and think of what to do. Across the street, the liquor store stretches beneath the sleepy glow of the golden arches. Above me, a dozen flying insects orbit a humming streetlight. The night air is hot and quiet. I never feel quite safe in these moments of stillness, when the world is at rest. I’m not sure that anyone does. The night is a fearsome creature with whom we have been embattled since the beginning of time. It doesn’t matter how many lights we turn on; at this hour, there’s nothing to mask the terrible naked truth that in this world, anything could happen and you never know what might be coming for you. 

It’s then that it hits me—a truly terrible idea, but the only one I have: 

*Abby F.* 

Amazingly, my mind hasn’t tossed away her address as it usually does immediately after I’ve delivered an order. It’s still there. She’s a total stranger of course, but only a few blocks away. And she’s likely still awake since I just delivered her rum about an hour ago. It’s a stretch, but if she sees me at her door maybe she’ll assume there’s an issue with her order and not turn me away immediately. That assumption alone could buy me a few seconds to explain myself. At the very least, maybe she’ll let me borrow her phone to arrange a ride home. It’s the only option I have that doesn’t involve a night-long walk across the city or a stop back at C*hez Emile.*

I’m at her door now. The lights are still on in her kitchen, backed by the muffled chatter of the television. Same as I left it. I push the button on her video doorbell and cringe at what I’m doing. I don’t have much time to dwell on it though, because unlike Emile V., she answers over the speaker right away.

“You’re back? I’m pretty sure I paid for my stuff, right?” she asks, quite reasonably.

“Uhh. Yeah, you did. Sorry, I have never done this before but I’m in a bit of a weird situation. I had to ditch my car and my phone’s dead. Could I possibly use yours to order a ride home? I wasn’t sure where else to go.”

There are a few seconds of silence, but I haven’t lost her yet.

“Damn. You’ve had an even worse night than mine, haven’t you?”

This eases the tension a little and I manage to crack a smile. “Well I don’t know what’s happened to you, but on my end it seems like someone’s stalking me.”

There’s another longer moment of silence, but this time her voice comes back through the door as she cracks it open and peers out.

“Come again?” she says. Her face is serious and focused.

“Uh. You know… stalking. I think someone’s been following me for a while and then just now I had them as a customer. It was really scary, actually. I think they somehow planned it and I don’t know what to do. I may be in serious trouble.” 

I don’t know why I’m telling her all of this when I’m only here to use her phone. But then I realize that maybe I *am* here for more. A ride home is only the first—and smallest—of the problems I now seem to have, but the look on her face tells me that she might actually be able to help.

She looks up and down the street, then directly at me. Her eyes betray a certain confidence like she knows something important, and that makes me feel less alone. 

“Let’s not talk out here,” she says. “Come inside.”

I do exactly what she says. In fact, right now I will do just about anything she asks of me. Anything to get off the street and wash away the image of the man’s piercing stare and his slow, manufactured smile. The moment I step through the door I feel invincible, like I’ve entered a fortress. I scan the contents of the walls and wonder if perhaps I actually have. Various types of antique weaponry and several certificates are mounted along the walls. At the far end of the room, two flags rest behind glass above the mantle. One is orange, white, and green in vertical stripes; the other is blue and red with a crest in the center. Abby F. follows my eyes as she mutes the television.

“My father was Irish and my mother was Haitian. They were both so proud of where they came from. I try my best to carry that pride for them now,” she says, then pauses. “I lost them both in a car accident—five years ago today, actually. That’s why I’m still up drinking alone, in case you were wondering.” 

“I’m so sorry,” I say. “That’s awful.”

“Thanks.” She pauses again, then turns back to me. “But that was five years ago. We need to talk about what happened with you tonight.” 

The tone has shifted, and I wonder why she has become so readily invested in my safety.

“Look, I’m sorry I came back here—and so late, at that. I really just needed to use a phone and find a ride home,” I say. “I didn’t mean to put all this on you. It’s not your problem. And it sounds like you’ve got enough going on toni—“

“No, you don’t understand,” she interrupts. “This may *be* my problem. I don’t know how you got so lucky as to be so bold and come back here, but it just might have saved your life.”

I’m lost now. “What do you mean?” I ask.

“I’m Special Agent Abby Fitzgerald, FBI.” She says, pulling out her badge. “The encounter that you described outside sounds like the work of The Sugar Hill Slicer. I have been tracking his movements for years and if your story is true, then you’ve just led me straight to him.”

Of course. I felt it. I knew something wasn’t right. I feel faint now, but she grabs my shoulders and shakes me to attention. 

“Stick with me. You need to listen carefully.”

“I delivered McDonald’s to a serial killer,” I say as both a clarifying question and a statement.

“It sounds like it, yes,” she says. “Either way you were actually in no immediate danger tonight. He never kills on the first encounter. That’s your first stroke of luck. Had this been your second order, though, you’d almost definitely be dead.” 

I’m processing this more slowly than she would prefer, but I’m doing my best to keep up.

“Your second stroke of luck—and I mean a once-in-a-lifetime stroke of luck—is not only that I happened to be one of your customers, but that you somehow thought to come back here. Nobody has ever gotten help in time. Those who’ve called the police on him in the past all waited until the second time they ran into him. By the time they call, he’s on them before we can get any real information. He uses different addresses and names to place his orders. We’ve found many of them, but he’s always long gone by the time we arrive.”

“Has *anyone* ever gotten away from him?” I ask.

“It’s possible. But all the ones that we know about are dead.”

I let this sink in. They’re all dead. All those other people who got an offer that was just too good to refuse. Late at night before the rent was due, at their most desperate hour. He knew exactly when to drop the hook into the water. He followed them, studied them, waited for his moment. He knew when to make himself known and when to be invisible. And he reeled them in—every last one.

“The addresses,” I say. “Won’t he eventually run out of places to hide?”

“You’d think,” she says. “But he’s slippery. He breaks into vacant homes and apartments that have been for sale or rent for months on end with no takers. He’ll even commandeer people’s homes when they’re away on vacation or at work—but leave them alone completely. There have been people who have had him coming in and out of their house for days or weeks at a time totally undetected, only to find out that he was there at all by seeing it on the news.”

“That’s insane… Wait, so he breaks into random people’s homes only to lure in and kill *other* people?”

“That’s right. He couldn’t care less about the people living in these places. He’s only interested in killing delivery drivers. Which means right now, he’s only interested in killing you.”

What do I say to this? I feel dead already. It’s just a matter of time until he finds me and adds another notch to the tally. I’m just another little fish swimming around in his pond, waiting to be caught.

She takes a swig of the rum that was sitting on my passenger seat not long ago. The bottle is nearly halfway empty now, and I realize this man has been slowly killing *her* in another way. She sets it down and looks at me. 

“…You’ve *never* heard of this guy before?”

“I don’t really watch the news,” I say. “So how long have you been after him? Years, you said?”

“Well, when I got assigned his case after academy, he’d already been at this for almost twenty years. A lot of these types have a territory they stick to—home turf. But this guy’s an itinerant killer, moving from state to state, city to city. He first showed up in New York back in the late nineties going after pizza delivery guys. Got his nickname in Harlem after murdering three drivers from Sugar Hill Pizzeria. Killed them all with a fucking *chef’s* knife. The place had to shut down; couldn’t manage to hire anyone after that. Go figure.”

“Jesus...”

“Yeah, go ahead and call upon Him. You’ll need Him.” 

“I’ll take all the help I can get at this point.”

“Anyway, NYPD was on his trail, so his best chance was to keep moving. He worked his way up the eastern state line, eventually hopped over into Vermont, then New Hampshire, then Maine… a few months here, a year or two there. But then after a few murders in Boston, he went dark. We got nothing on him for a couple years, so we thought he might finally be done. We even considered the possibility that he was dead. Then about a year ago we picked up a string of murders here in Providence, including all of his signatures. With a new spot and all of these new delivery apps blowing up, he’s got plenty to do. It’s like some big end-of-career comeback—his third act, so to speak.”

“What if I just stopped doing deliveries?” I ask. I haven’t actually considered the implications here, but I’ll be happy to find another job if it saves my life.

“If only it were that simple,” she says. “If he’s been following you, then he’s already made up his mind. He’s coming for you. Quitting now won’t change that.”

“Well what am I supposed to do then? I can’t keep going out there!” I feel myself getting angry, not so much at Abby but at the finality of it all. As if it has already been determined and I’m just running down the clock to the end.

“That’s where you’re wrong,” Abby says. “If you quit, it might slow him down, but he will find you. He always does. But if you keep delivering, that gives us a line to work with. It’s actually our best chance of catching him.”

“What do you mean?”

“I mean we’re going to set him up—and unfortunately, you’re the bait.”

“What if I don’t go along with this?”

“I think you already know what will happen if you don’t.”

I pause, then nod.

“Good.” She sighs and glances at her phone. “It’s getting past 2:00 AM now. Why don’t you just stay the night here on the couch? We can talk through a plan in the morning.”

Normally I would at least offer some polite back-and-forth here, but I don’t have the energy. I wouldn’t feel safe at my apartment anyway, so I’m more grateful than I let on.

I nod again at her suggestion. “Thank you.”

“Don’t thank me yet,” she says. “Let’s see if we can save your life, first.”

# Part Two: Line

I am certain that I will get more sleep on Abby’s couch than I would at home, but even here at this hour of night it’s difficult to wind down. I turn over and stare at the ceiling for a while. For a few seconds, the corner of the room lights up as one of her extra chargers brings my phone back to life. The chime which signaled my last GrabNGo order hours before echoes in my mind, and my arms break out in goosebumps. I pull the blanket tighter against me and try to think of something else. Anything. At last I remember something practical—inconvenient, but not horrifying. For once, I am grateful for inconvenience in light of imminent death. My final thought before falling asleep is not of the unfolding terror of this night, but of my dog at home. I will have to go back home at some point to take care of him, but I’m confident that he’ll make it through the night. I’m less than sure of my own prospects, but thankfully I fall asleep before I’m able to think of that all over again.

\*\*\*\*\*

In the morning, I wake to the smell of coffee. Abby is in the kitchen looking like she’s been up for a while, when she notices me stirring on the couch and calls me over.

“I may drink like I’m Irish, but in the morning I try to have a proper Haitian breakfast,” she smiles. “Please, have something to eat.”

This takes no convincing. I haven’t eaten since around four o’clock yesterday and from the sweet aroma coming off the stovetop, I can tell that she is more than a competent cook. In addition to the coffee, there’s pancakes, chopped fruit, and something involving spiced plantains. I put a bit of everything on a plate, pour some coffee, and sit across from Abby at the table. She wastes no time.

”I’ve been up for about an hour—couldn’t sleep much,” she says. “But it gave me time to think about our situation. Like I said last night, your second stroke of luck was coming to me. You have advantages that no one else has had, and we’re going to have to put them to use quickly before he finds you again. If the past is any indicator, a second encounter could be your last.” 

“What are these advantages?”

“You’ve ditched your car—that’s a good start. That means there’s still a chance he doesn’t know what you drive, assuming he doesn’t already know where you live. Unfortunately we just don’t know the extent of his knowledge about you. Best not to chance it.”

“What about the car? How am I supposed to keep doing deliveries? And my apartment? My dog? I can’t just leave everything.”

“I made a few calls this morning and got it taken care of. We’re going to get you a rental and a gas card. You’ll drive something simple, low profile. Your car will stay where it is. We have a temporary permit for the apartment complex being made up now to put on the back window, so it will look like it belongs there. We swept that building this morning, by the way. Sure enough there were four vacant units—all *sans* fingerprints—but no doubt he was holed up in one of them last night.

“Anyway, we’re also going to set you up at a hotel, under federal protection—with your dog, don’t worry. Agents will be stationed at your apartment around the clock. Your financial obligations will be covered. Until we catch this guy, you will want for nothing.”

“You’re doing all of this for me? One lowly driver? This man has killed dozens of people—maybe hundreds!”

“Yes. I told you I would do everything I can to keep you alive, and this is how. Quite honestly, you being here has changed everything. We need you. I have been following The Sugar Hill Slicer for the better part of a decade now, and you are my first *real* lead. This may be our only chance to catch him. If we do, we can save you and God only knows how many other people down the line.”

I say nothing to this, but she knows that I’m beginning to fully understand our situation. It’s clear that I need her if I want even a prayer of staying alive. And I’m apparently the only living connection to one of the most prolific serial killers of the last thirty years. We are in each other’s debt many times over. 

“So besides everything I’ve just mentioned, you’re going to keep things the same,” she continues. “You’ll deliver at the same times, work the same areas, and follow your routine as closely as you can. We can’t afford to raise any suspicions that you’re working with us. With your consent and that of the company, we will monitor your GrabNGo account, which will allow us see all orders in real time and mirror your app when it’s open. You’ll also wear an earpiece while you’re out in case we need to alert you.”

She gives me a moment to think, and in the quiet of the kitchen I sigh a little louder than intended. It’s a lot to take in and I’m still in shock, but I’m also relieved to have someone doing all of the legwork. Standing in these particular crosshairs, death feels a bit less certain with Uncle Sam in my corner. 

“Okay,” is all I manage to say. She reaches across the table, touches my arm, and looks me in the eyes.

“You can do this,” she says. “He can’t keep on like this forever.” 

*She’s right*, I think. The idea seems awfully convenient to me, but maybe his time has come. Maybe this Sugar Hill Slicer has lured his last victim. I think of how long I’ve been doing these deliveries, believing myself to be living a life of mediocrity. Never have I considered the possibility that this entirely unimpressive line of work could produce an opportunity to save lives. And I wonder for a moment if perhaps some great ambition of mine has always been there, just waiting to be realized.

\*\*\*\*\*

I’m in the car. Then I’m in the building. He’s in the hallway with a chef’s knife in hand. I should be running but the overwhelming sensations of terror and grief are sandbags upon my feet. I try to scream as I see it happening, telling myself to get out while I still can, but I only watch as he inches towards me with acute deliberation. His eyes are a pair of dice, pupils sharpened to a point as he draws closer with every step. Then he’s standing over me, raising the knife. He brings it down hard and fast and everything turns to black.

And then I’m awake. 

It goes on like this every night for weeks.

\*\*\*\*\*

It’s been a month. There’s been no sign of The Slicer since this whole operation got underway—at least nothing real. But there hasn’t been a single night that I haven’t seen him in my dreams, his cold and terrible face interrupting the usual nightly programming to make himself known. To remind me that he’s still there, still aware of me. At every turn I’ll catch sight of him for a moment, only to blink him away and see some other harmless individual instead. Every name on every order I receive, I’m convinced is another one of his many aliases. Every home at which I deliver I fear is one of his false fronts, commandeered for his dreadful purposes. I think I understand in some twisted way, why he doesn’t just kill people right away—why he didn’t kill *me* right away. He wants me to suffer—to fear him—while he savors whatever perverted feeling it gives him. He wants me to grow weaker every day as my body works around the clock to protect itself, in constant anticipation of some unspeakable fate.

On my first day going back to deliveries, I could barely get myself out of bed, let alone to drive around and face the prospect of being murdered. I started small, going out an hour earlier than usual and wrapping up around sunset. But I’ve slowly found my pace again.

Now it’s 10:42 on a Saturday morning and I’m sitting behind the wheel of a much newer vehicle than my own (*This* car was actually made in the current decade!) After two weeks of sticking to my usual routine, Abby suggested that we give the morning circuit a try. 

“Maybe he’ll be trying to catch you at a different time of day,” she’d said, “so we’ll let him. And then we’ll let him have it.”

“*Let him have it.”* I had to laugh at that one. Sometimes she sounds like she’s auditioning for the role of an old beat cop in some cheesy movie. I have to admit, while that would normally be annoying, it’s a little charming on her.

What worries me is that our plan assumes he knows nothing of what we’re up to. But what if he does? What if he’s been one step ahead of us the whole time? The whole cat and mouse routine doesn’t really work if both players believe themselves to be the cat. I can only hope that Abby knows what she’s doing, and even if she does, I’m not yet convinced that it will be enough for me to get out of this alive. Maybe they’ll finally catch their man, but that doesn’t mean he won’t still kill me first.

I turn over all the potential outcomes again and again in my mind like some kind of impossible Rubik’s Cube, when suddenly my phone chimes. For a moment I’m grateful—or I would be if I wasn’t so sure of what comes next. 

It chimes again. 

And though I hear this exact sound a dozen times a day, this time feels different. It rings in my ears like a faraway echo trying desperately to be heard. A warning. I don’t know if I believe in God, or guardian angels, or benevolent deceased ancestors tipping the scales of goodwill in one’s favor, but if any of those things exist, this must be what it feels like to encounter them. I can’t explain it, but in this moment I know that I’ve been given something impossible—what Abby might call a “third stroke of luck.” I, myself, can only describe it as some kind of overwhelming intuition. All I know is that as the order appears on my screen waiting for me to accept it, I have an inexplicable feeling that it’s him. 

It’s time.

# Part Three: Sinker

My phone chimes a third time and I tap the screen to accept the order: a large hot coffee and a poppy seed bagel with cream cheese from Anton’s. The fare is a significantly more modest, though still respectable sum of fifteen dollars. I pick up the order and begin driving towards the address. The GPS tells me I have nine minutes until my arrival. Nine minutes to prepare myself. 

*Nine minutes to live.*

I can’t spend the whole drive thinking of that, so I get Abby on the phone. She answers on the first ring.

“Hey, what’s up? Everything okay?”

“I don’t know… It might be nothing. I got an order at Anton’s and… I can’t really explain it. I just have a weird feeling about this one.”

The line is quiet for a moment, and I know she feels what I’m feeling. Perhaps she hears it in my voice.

“Well if I’ve learned anything, it's that you should usually trust weird feelings,” she says. “Most of the time, there’s something to them. I’ll have patrol tighten up the perimeter. We have the address, so we’ll be no more than a quarter mile away by the time you get there—just around the corner.”

I pull into the empty driveway of a freshly built single-story Cape and ring the doorbell. There’s no one home, from the look of it. I wonder for a moment if I have the wrong address, but that’s not it. I’m delivering breakfast to an empty house. Maybe th—

*An empty house.*

I close my eyes and try to tell myself that the customer is just out somewhere and on their way back. But I know the truth. I knew it before and I know it now.

*He’s slippery.*

I step away from the door and scan the lawn for something I hadn’t thought to look for at first. It isn’t there. I turn back to face the house again and look in the windows—not there either. But when I approach the door again, I catch the corner of something peeking out of the bushes. I slide it out from its hiding place, and see exactly what I feared: a plastic sign with fresh dirt caked on its thin wire stakes.

***FOR SALE***

***by owner***

***CALL TODAY!***

My earpiece crackles and suddenly Abby’s voice is in my head.

“You’ve been there for over a minute—everything okay?”

“I uhh…” I’m frozen in place, eyes glued to the sign. I’ve experienced this every night in my dreams, spent every waking moment in anticipation of it, and now it’s happening. And just like in the dreams, I can’t move.

“Come on, you’ve got to give me something, that’s the only way this works. Are you okay?” Abby asks again.

Then, there’s another voice.

“I hate to break it to you, but the house isn’t quite ready for viewing yet.” 

It’s him, standing in the doorway, grinning at his own stupid remark.

“In fact,” he adds, “I don’t think it will be for some time.”

Abby is back on the earpiece: “That’s it, you’ve got ten seconds to tell me you’re okay or we’re coming in. What’s your status!?”

What happens in the span of these ten seconds is a matter of life and death.

*One*

He takes one step towards me and pulls a knife out from behind him. I can’t convince myself fast enough that this is real. This is the kind of thing that happens to someone else. But it *isn’t* happening to someone else. It’s happening to me and it’s happening *right now*.

*Come on, move! You have to go. Now. GO!* I scream into the silent chamber of thought. But I remain still.

He takes another step.

*Two*

I stand there, gripping the cup of coffee and the paper bag containing the bagel in one hand as a grin stretches across his face. I still can’t move. Now is my only chance to run, but I can’t bring myself to take a single step.

*Three*

My stomach hitches up into a loose knot and I feel a sharp twisting pain as its contents begin to swirl. The bag slips from my fingers. 

He steps again.

*Four*

He reaches out, scrunches the front of my shirt in a tight fist, and begins to drag me through the door.

*Five*

I feel completely sick now, but I finally find my voice.

“Y—you don’t have to do this! Th-th-they’re going to come for you!”

“GET OUT of there! Use the tas—!” Abby begins to say, but I don’t hear the rest. He slaps away the earpiece and it rolls to the floor.

*Six*

But I heard enough. The taser! I forgot they gave me one. It’s so tiny that I put it on my keychain. I unclip my keys as he turns to face me. We’re in the house now and he’s closed the door.

*Seven*

I point the taser at him and squeeze the button. Nothing happens. I go to squeeze it again, but it’s already too late. 

He’s swinging the knife.

*Eight*

He brings it down fast and before I can even feel the pain, the taser drops to the floor in a puddle of blood. It rocks back and forth on the floorboards, still cradled in my disembodied hand.

When I look at my arm, the sight of what remains is too much to bear and I suddenly feel more angry and aware of my body than I ever have in my life.

*Nine*

I scream and hurl myself backwards to create a pocket of space between us while I think of what to do. I have nothing—not even both of my hands—and it won’t be long now before I bleed out.

Wait. I *do* have something. There’s the coffee. Even as my right hand was being chopped off, somehow my left kept dutifully gripping the cup.

Anything can be a weapon if you’re desperate enough.

*Ten*

I squeeze the cup just enough to pop the lid off and fling the steaming contents in his direction. As the scalding beverage rains down upon his head, threatening to blind and boil, he cries out and falls to the floor, clawing desperately at his face.

“Here’s your fucking coffee, you sick bastard!” I scream.

Then I throw the empty cup at him, bolt out the door, and collapse onto the front lawn.

*Time!*

I lay there, about to faint, when I remember my severed hand. I rip off my shirt, wrap it around the stump of my forearm, and wait as the sound of approaching sirens begins to swell. Behind me I hear the crashing of furniture and breaking of glass. I try to prepare myself to move again, but he doesn’t come out.

Within ninety seconds, Abby and a team of a dozen officers are pouring out of armored vans and onto the lawn.

“You’re alive! Are you hurt? …my God, your arm!” She says all at once as she kneels in the grass next to me.

I feel myself slipping fast, but I manage to point with my only hand towards the door. “He… he’s still in the house” I say. “So’s my hand… you’ve got to.. you’ve..”

My vision narrows and the adrenaline that’s kept me going this long is rapidly draining away. The last thing I remember in a final moment of awareness is the officer stepping back out onto the lawn.

“We’ve searched the entire house… He’s gone.”

# Epilogue

I’m parked behind Chili’s watching the last sliver of sun sink into the night, waiting to see where my next eight dollars will come from. Just as I was before. It’s been six months since I passed out on the lawn that day, and the whole thing is probably as over as it’s going to be. Yet I’m not sure it will ever quite feel that way knowing he’s still out there somewhere. I absently clench and release my hands over the steering wheel as I’ve done ever since I got the prosthetic. In return for my service they sprung for a Skywalker-style myoelectric right hand. A consolation prize for being the only person to ever survive The Sugar Hill Slicer—and for *almost* catching him.

As the blue of the sky darkens closer to black, I sit in my little car and wonder how anyone is supposed to feel safe in this world. I think of how many billions of people there are sharing this one fragile planet, and how we all go about each day assuming we’re safe, but in truth it’s impossible know. How many times in our life might we be inches away from death and not even know it? How many of the people that we interact with online are actually who they claim to be? The questions are endless and terrifying, but thankfully my phone interrupts the thought. 

A text from Abby:

*Movie tomorrow? Skip orders?*

*Sure. Don’t have to twist my arm on that one haha ;)*

A few seconds go by, so I add:

*…what, too soon?*

*You’re awful lol. WAY too soon! Anyway, I’ll pick you up at six. Looking forward to it :)*

I smile stupidly at the screen, thinking about how funny I am and wondering if Abby’s as into me as I’m into her and maybe life is finally looking up an—

And then the chime goes off.

My name is Daphne

I'm average, I'm normal for the most part. I'm not amazing in school nor do I have the most gorgeous or ugliest face. I just exist. That's always been how I am. I'm a normal 16 year old girl. 

I know that I have a loving mother named Mary and a caring father named Michael. I have an older sister named Justine, she is very kind to me and we are the best of friends.

My life is pretty average for the most part. I'm nothing special. I don't like writing in this diary but ever since the accident the doctors told me I should. 

I remember small bits and pieces of my life and who I am, I remember that my favorite colour is yellow and that I love golden retrievers. My family had one when I was younger. I remember going to school and having a few friends, not completely alone and not popular, just in the middle. 

I am to write to myself daily, the doctors said it'll help speed the process of me getting my memories back. 

If I am reading this in the future, do not trust Daniel, he wears a black hoodie and has a baseball hat. He will hurt you.

My name is Daphne.

I like dogs and the colour yellow. I have two loving parents and a kind older sister. 

I go to school and I'm a normal average teen. I'm 16 years old. I'm not too ugly or too pretty. I'm normal. 

I was in an accident that makes me forget things for the first 6 months and I write in this journal to help with the memory loss. The doctors recommended it to me. 

It's been a month since the accident. I remember bits and pieces from before it but not very much. Everyday I forget more and more but if I don't write then I'll forget more and more. 

Mother can't look at me anymore without tearing up. They had to pull me out of school and I feel like I disappointed her. Father is too busy with work and sister is the only one who treats me normally. I'll hopefully be able to return to the same grade as my friends next year. 

I just want things to go back to normal. I don't remember all of it but I remember that I used to be happy and the pictures on the wall showed me that I was a talented girl, I could draw and dance. I was good at it. I don't remember any of that now.

Names are getting harder to remember. I know that my sister's name started with a J but I can't remember it. It's all so fuzzy. 

Don't trust the man in the black hoodie.

My name is Daphne.

I have a loving mother and father and a sister.

I am a normal teenager. I went to school and will go back once I recover.

I have an illness that I can't seem to remember. Doctors told me to write in this book to help my recovery. The first 6 months I'll forget a lot but I should be fine, that's what mother tells me. 

I'm no longer allowed to go out unsupervised but my parents won't come with me anywhere. I'm so tired of being stuck inside all day it's so boring. Mother is stuck to her room crying, I know she is disappointed in me. Father is never home and always smells this strong horrible smell. Sister doesn't talk to me anymore, she stays away from me now. I can barely remember what I did but I must've down something to make them upset. I know it's to do with my illness. I just want to be better for them. 

I want to get better so I'm writing, I'm still writing. I'm supposed to be better than this I know I am.

I'm a normal teenager. I stay home and I write a lot. I've filled a lot of sketchbooks since the accident. I think I'm getting good. I try to show mom but she cries so much. Nothing i do can cheer her up. Father left. He and mother fought a lot, it was loud, so so loud. He took sister with him, I miss her. She was the only one that talked to me. When I was with her I swear I felt like I started remembering things. 

She told me to call her but I'm not allowed to use a phone. 

The light is getting brighter and brighter. In my dreams I hear them again, I hear their calls like sirens. They miss me. 

I'm so so bored. Mom keeps me in all day, I'm not allowed outside. She's too tired or busy for it. I just want to make her happy but I feel like I'm going insane for it.

Me and my mother live together and she takes care of me. I stay home all day and write. She always makes me write. I hate her. I only write. I'm so tired of words. I'm so tired of being stuck in this house. I'm so tired of everything. I just want run away but mother won't let me. She says I need to write and that I need to remember. I want to make her proud but I just can't. It's all so much. I miss my friends, they told me that there are ways to see them outside of my sleep.

That was the last entry my daughter wrote in her main diary before she ran away. I blame myself entirely I know. I'm posting this here so that I can get some help, I know the internet is good for that. So please. Please help me find my daughter. 

Here's the information that was not included:

The accident was a violent kidnapping. She had been lured online by a vile vile man. When we finally found her after two months of searching she was alive luckily. The issue was that they had been using her as entertainment, not in a sexual way. They tested drugs on her to see the side effects on a young girl, they wanted to 'push her to her greatest capabilities'. She was their experiment to see how long it took to break her. My Daphne was strong, she did not break. 

When we did get her back she couldn't tell us anything that happened, she didn't remember anything and the doctors felt that it was best that for the time being she didn't know. What I know from small bits I've picked up from her writing and the information that the officers told her is that she was used as an experiment. The people who did this had done this before and had already been arrested for drug trafficking. Online they were her 'friends', they were terrible influences that made her go along into impure ways like drinking and smoking. A few them came to pick her up to a 'new heaven for her' and took her, right from our front yard. Most of the people responsible were found and arrested, a few managed to escape but I don't know much else. They weren't the main problems though so that's all good. 

When we found her she was rushed the hospital and spent around 2 months there. The doctors told us that throughout the next 6 months she was going to forget more and more if we couldn't get her to remember who she was. Around when the six months were up then we'd know if we'd get our sweet Daphne back. 

Michael was a coward and he left, he claimed that Daphne couldn't be his child and left with his only 'heir'.

I admit that I was the reason she ran away but please listen to me. I was scared, so so scared of losing my precious baby girl. I couldn't let her out not after what those vile men did to her. The doctors suggested writing about everything she remembered so all day I'd make her write page after page of every little thing she remembered. I guess it got too much for her. I'm so sorry. 

Please help me find my baby girl. I'm so so desperate.

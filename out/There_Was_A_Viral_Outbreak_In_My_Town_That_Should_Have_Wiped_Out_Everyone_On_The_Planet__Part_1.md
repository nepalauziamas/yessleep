I’d felt it, far off, similar to a pre-storm migraine, for months. Like some force in the world had plans for us we didn’t know about but could see forming. 

The pregnancy had been rocky from the start, not to mention how many IVF treatments it took. It felt like both our lives had been on some rickety train track, somehow still clinging to the edges. Neither of us were ready, and we both knew it. It was like a third person was already in the room, constantly waiting to be introduced so they could talk some sense into us.

Jules was getting worked to the bone at the hospital over the past year, understaffed and underpaid. She took time off as soon as she could when the pregnancy was confirmed. She told me she had similar feelings as I did. Like something was coming. And not just the baby. 

She kept saying she just wanted me home, on the couch beside her at night. My hands on hers as she massaged her growing belly. That was all she needed for comfort. 

I was a beat cop and dragged my feet on asking for the time off. So fate stepped in, and ushered me along in a way I couldn’t imagine.

It was a Friday and I was going to talk to the staff sergeant at the end of the shift, but I received a call to the local junior high school. There was a shooting in progress. Two active shooters with small explosives. 

I pulled into the parking lot of the school and saw smoke billowing from windows, and fire lashing out from within. 

I rushed to the back doors of the school but found them chain locked from the inside. I could see there was a thick padlock keeping it shut. Gunfire, screams and small explosions rang out from inside. Smoke was creeping out from under the doors. 

I radioed back. They said tactical was four minutes away. Another Officer, O’Reilly, was a minute out though, and to wait on him before breaching. We wouldn’t be able to help the kids inside the door any way.

The IARD training we did, *Immediate Action, Rapid Deployment*, was very clear that in high-risk situations, our only intent was to take out the shooter. Run fast and shoot straight. Early contact is key. It was a concept that came out in the wake of the Columbine shooting. First responders were no longer setting up a perimeter. Or even trying to help those wounded. Locating and neutralizing the shooters was our lone purpose.

The crying on the other side of the door had turned to whimpering. The banging had stopped.

I checked the time. A minute had passed. No sign of O’Reilly. He was probably stopping at green lights. He was the type of cop who actively avoided any call that required him getting out of his cruiser. Wherever he was, I bet he was monitoring the radio and wouldn’t show up until after tactical arrived.

The whimpering on the other side of the door went quiet. I couldn’t wait any longer. I’d already waited too long. 

I ran back to my cruiser and got my pack - Bolt cutters, pry bar, additional vest to protect from their high powered rifles.  

I speared the pry bar into the meshy window. The glass cubed away, but I had to tear through the thick, metal netting. Smoke poured out and all the sounds of the horrors inside came rushing up to meet me. I could barely see inside, but managed to find the padlock and snapped it with the bolt cutters. 

I yanked the door open, and two tiny bodies spilled out. 

They’d been the ones pressed against the door, whimpering. They were gone now. 

I wanted to go home. I wanted to shut the blinds to the world and disappear forever. It would be so easy to just turn back now, wait for tactical since O’Reilly must have gotten lost. 

A scream pierced out from inside, and pulled me back to the doorway to hell. I could see more bodies, hazy through the smoke. 

I pulled my glock and slid in through the door, finding destruction like I couldn’t imagine. My senses were overwhelmed. The air reeked of cordite so heavily I felt it coating my lungs. My ears were ringing from the gunfire and explosions overhead. The smoke detectors were screeching in short bursts, adding to the ringing. Some had been shot off the ceiling, but still squeaked out a distorted alarm. 

And the walls… the ones I could see, looked like they’d been painted red. 

Smoke hung in the air like a storm cloud. The hallway floor was lined with bodies. Tiny backpacks strapped to them. What an AR15 can do to a body… a kid’s body… is indescribable. 

I walked towards the end of the hall, where a staircase led up. The gunfire and explosions were coming from the second floor, so that’s where I was going. 

I made my way down the hall, ducking just below the smoke line and keeping my eyes trained away from the floor. I was ten feet from the staircase when the war zone upstairs went quiet. 

Gunfire. Explosions. Screams. It all muted out. Only the occasional and distorted smoke detectors pierced the silence.  

I kept moving.

A new sound startled me, causing me to nearly fire off my gun. 

It was a cell phone chime. Muffled out from underneath one of the bodies. 

Then another ringtone. And another. And another. A chorus of phone calls were coming in to various cell phones. And all I could think was how sad I was for the parents who would never hear their children’s voices pick up on the other end. Or ever again. My heart broke for them all. 

All the parents who dropped off their kids in the morning, not knowing they were saying goodbye. 

Then I heard whistling. Laughter. Joking and talking. Two voices. Males. They were coming down the staircase. 

I took a knee to the left of the stairs and trained my glock on the stairway entrance. I was off to the side just enough they wouldn’t see me until after I’d seen them.

The laughing got closer. Echoing down the halls. The whistling started again. He was reciting the tune of “Pop Goes The Weasel.” 

My finger rested against the trigger. I was ready. 

The laughing and whistling harmonized together now to the same tune, echoing louder and closer. 

I trained my gun at head level. No. Chest level. Two in the chest. Put the first one down, then the second.

But… what if there’s a third? 

Footsteps hit the last row of stairs. Two sets of footsteps. Only two. My gun was hair triggered on the entryway.

*Pop Goes The Weasel* got louder, more disturbed. 

Two shadows appeared in the entrance, my finger hovered on the trigger, but didn’t pull. 

Then they appeared in the doorway. 

Both had been dressed in skeleton print suits, and carried chest kits and ammo vests with additional handguns to accompany their modified AR’s. 

They both appeared to be late teens, but I couldn’t see their faces. 

The first one hand-painted on a clown face, with an exaggerated, toothy grin up his cheeks. It was frightening, as the rest of his face was smeared with red ink. The other kid had a Hannibal Lector mask on. It was smeared with blood, which I couldn’t tell was real or fake. 

They saw me as soon as I saw them, but all three of us froze. 

I had the drop on them, my glock already levelled at my target. 

They smiled, dropped their guns, and held out their wrists to be handcuffed. 

“Arrest us. You’ll be the hero,” they said, tauntingly. 

I couldn’t. I couldn’t take them in.

I didn’t think about whether they had explosives charges on them that could have blown up not only us, but possibly even the entire school. I didn’t think about how torturous prison would be for them for the rest of their lives if I brought them in. 

All I could think, was how much I wanted them buried under the prison. And erased from history. 

I put two in the smiling teen’s chest, and two in the Hannibal kid’s chest.

They both went down hard. 

I felt rage take over completely, and I unloaded the rest of the magazine between the two. I peppered their faces. I didn’t want them to have an open casket. I never wanted anyone to see these two again.

I was put on leave as SIU came in to investigate. I was brought in multiple times, interviews racked my days and there was very nearly a criminal case against me by the parents of the shooters. They had a reasonable case against what I did. I just can’t imagine having the nerve to bring it forward after what their children had done. 

I’d been off work ever since. Which had been the plan before… just not in this way. Nightmares haunted me. All of them were with the two boys. I was older in the dream, and somehow I knew I had a daughter in an upstairs classroom. But I couldn’t get to her. The floors were wet cement and I felt like my muscles had been stripped from my legs. The dream would always end with a chase to get to her. And I always lost. 

There were a few weeks where I was almost positive I was going to jail. The lawyer had called and told me prosecution was seeking five years for each of the kid’s. And a massive lawsuit against the force. 

But in the last week, it all crumbled away. It turned out to be a pie in the sky hope from the prosecution, and I was let off but put on leave with mandatory, weekly visits to a behavioural psychologist, to start immediately. I figured that was a fair trade. Even though I was feeling more and more like I didn’t belong on the force. The investigation coming up clean was a gift and a lesson. I didn’t belong there. 

What I was gonna do now, I had no idea. I had some time to decide, and with Jules pregnant, our hands would be full for a while. 

With us both home now, I’d seen changes in Jules as the pregnancy wore on. More and more, I’d find her in the baby’s room, holding up the tiny onesies over her belly. The little socks and beanie caps. Looking through the picture books we’d eventually entertain her with. Getting used to the sway of the rocking chair. There was a basket filled with yarn and sewing needles Jules put together and had been learning over the last few weeks. She was embracing it all, despite the dark cloud we’d felt lingering. 

It was Friday, and we’d gone in for Jules’ last check-up before delivery next week. I’d been dreading it, thinking something would come up. Something unavoidable, or unfixable. 

But the baby was perfect. Our little girl was healthy and ready to be delivered on her due date. 

On our way home from the OB/GYN, I’d noticed the Wakewood subway station was closed off. In fact, the whole street was. There were white vans and trucks and scientists in hazmat suits. And a strong military presence. Normally I wouldn’t be nervous about something like this, but the station was a block away from our apartment building. 

And what was more strange, I didn’t see any news stations nearby. Not one reporting on anything. 

When we got home, I checked for any updates about Wakewood. Nothing from any major, medium or minor news networks. All I found were a few posts from anons on Twitter. Which were shadow banned or quickly taken down. 

Just as my interest peaked, there was a knock at the window. Although we were six storeys up, this was far from abnormal. 

Rick, our neighbour from the apartment next door, was on the balcony we shared, which was separated by a large piece of frosted glass. We joked that we were kind of like each other’s Wilson’s from Home Improvement. I joined him on the balcony and bummed a drag from his cig over the partition. 

I was happy to see Rick and figured he’d have some wild idea about what was going on. He worked for the city, but thrived on conspiracy theories and had his finger on the pulse. He was never less than interesting, and wasn’t insulting or condescending. 

As it turned out, he had a huge scoop on what was happening. I tried to keep up but he spoke fast, overwhelming me with information. Sometimes it felt like that was part of how he came across as persuasive. Every word and sentence marched out like a perfectly thorough and thought out idea. He spoke well and found the right words to make you question what you previously believed.  

Rick claimed there was a viral leak. Down by the water, in the industrial district, there are several large warehouses that contain some kind of secret government facilities. At one of the warehouses in a gain-of-function lab, a vicious strain of an experimental pathogen had gotten out. An infected lab worker left work, got on the subway, and made it five stops before getting off and dying on the tracks. 

The worker apparently started screaming and jumped over the edge as a new subway was coming into the station. They were trying to do contact tracing by using face identifying technology with the CCTV footage throughout the trains and platforms. 

I asked Rick how he knew this, and he said he had people working with the city that were feeding him details as they happened. Rick, himself, was an electrician and was constantly in and out of the subway systems. In fact, he told me he was sneaking in later. He had his own hazmat suit and clearance through the city. And if he got turned away, he said he’d creep in through the sewers. He knew some secret routes through the city.

And with that, Jules came out and the conversation turned towards the pregnancy and next week’s birth. Rick said he bought our soon to be born daughter a bottle of whiskey for her 18th birthday, so it’ll age nicely by the time she opens it. 

Jules and Rick went on, but I kept thinking about what Rick said about Wakewood station. It all seemed scary and true. He’d been persuasive again, and I felt anxiety creeping back in.  

During dinner, the speaker we were using to listen to Spotify turned off. I checked my cell but found no bars. Jules checked hers and it was the same. Our wireless router wasn’t picking up any signals. I turned on the TV and every channel had the same thing on a bright yellow screen. 

It was a warning. The downtown core was under strict and immediate lockdown. No one was to leave their homes under any circumstances. We were to leave the TV on for further instructions… as they came. 

Jules and I were in disbelief. Her more than I. I was thinking back to the conversation with Rick. And how much more sane it was sounding. I wanted to see what he thought about all this, but when I banged on the wall we shared with him, I got nothing back. 

That meant Rick was there, in the subway systems. Either discovering what was happening, or being discovered. 

I looked out the window and peered into other apartment buildings. They were all filled with the yellow lights from the TV screen warnings. Everyone was staring, helplessly, at the same thing. This was real. 

We talked about going to our neighbours down the hall or on other floors and see if they’d heard anything. But we decided to stay inside for the night and watch a blu ray. We wanted to get our minds off of what was happening and towards the excitement of next week. But it was impossible. 

We went to bed early, but just laid there. We were spooning, and I knew she was awake too. Our hands were in their nightly spot, linked together on top of her pregnant belly. I could feel the baby moving around most nights. 

But tonight was interrupted by knocks at the window in the living room. It was Rick. He was back. I went out to meet him on the balcony. He was panicking. Covered in sweat like he’d just run a marathon, which seemed at least half right. 

He’d gotten into the subway station. And he’d learned things. As he started, I was noticing how sweaty he’d gotten. He was coughing. His nose was running. If whatever he was talking about *was* a virus… he looked to have the most common symptoms. 

I asked him to calm down and speak slowly. He took a breath and laid it out. Rick claimed he was wrong, kind of, and that it wasn’t bio-chemical medical labs in the warehouses. It was a series of testing facilities for advanced particle accelerators. A defence contractor had built a groundbreaking new Hadron Collider to test the limits of cosmic acceleration and dark matter. It started with the creation of microscopic quantum black holes, but they’d been pushing the accelerator further. Its reach far-exceeding our known laws of nature. Of reality. 

Something came out of one of the black holes before the accelerator was shut down. The CDC had been brought in quickly to contain and study. What they’d discovered was something like a virus. At least that’s how they were referring to it. But it wasn’t like anything anyone had ever heard of. It was both physiological and psychological. It was being referred to as “Pandemia-115.”

It appeared that when you became infected, it started with a migraine, chills, a fever. Then the hallucinations start. You’ll hear things first. See things. And it will keep pushing them on you. The virus comes in three waves of those, over the course of a nine hour lifespan. 

It operated by latching into our nervous system and adrenal glands, feeding off our naturally occurring cortisol spikes during fear responses. The hyper-intelligent virus finds our most personal, fear-inducing thoughts, and super charges them, strengthening itself as we grow weaker. In the end, the virus burns the host out with a fever of 115. And what was worse… it had an 80% infection fatality rate.

Rick went into a hacking, coughing fit, which he then blamed on too many cigarettes. But it didn’t look like that. It looked like his body was trying to fight something off. And was losing. 

I was getting more nervous. Whether or not the Hadron collider thing was accurate or not, there was some kind of virus or bacteria that caused a massive, city-wide lockdown. And good or bad, Rick was our only current source of information. 

A spotlight hit our window from below, and yelling from a megaphone bellowed up from the street. Voices ordered us back inside, under threat of immediate arrest. 

I rushed in and right into Jules. She’d been there, at the doorway to the balcony, listening. We ducked down and shut the door. The spotlights turned off, and the eerie stillness of the quiet downtown returned. 

Jules and I whispered to each other. She told me she’d heard most of what Rick said, and it all sounded crazy. I agreed. But… something *was* happening. 

Footsteps and movement came from the stairs down the hall. I heard more orders being barked. Then… boards being put up against the doors. Nail guns firing off. They were locking all of us in our apartments. 

I went to the door to confront them, yelling that there was a pregnant woman inside. But there was no response, and before I could open the door, it was bolted shut. They locked down our whole floor, then moved on to the next one. We listened as they went through our entire building. We looked out the windows, keeping far enough away from the edges, and saw large teams of scientists and military personnel in hazmats, carrying medical equipment, nail guns and bolting equipment, or semi-automatic rifles. 

They also had body bags.

The side of our wall erupted in banging. It was Rick. It sounded like he was gonna come right through into our apartment. 

He started screaming. The most terrified, unsettling shrieks of absolute fear. I yelled to him, even banged back from our side. But Rick continued screaming and thudding his side of the wall. 

Then the thudding stopped. The screaming continued, but it moved through Rick’s apartment. A second later, we heard glass shattering. Then… a sick, horrifying thud on the pavement below. 

We rushed to the window and saw Rick’s body splayed out on the pavement. Hazmat suits moved in with large hoses and sprayed a cement-like liquid which solidified in seconds after covering his body. 

Spotlights hit his window and ours again. We dropped back down, hiding below the frame. After a moment, the spotlight disappeared and darkness resumed. We could hear workers below sterilizing and cleaning up the blood splatter from Rick’s body.  

Jules was crying quietly, trying to hide it. Not that she needed to. I was shook, and felt my stomach doing somersaults. We couldn’t wrap our heads around how quickly our lives had changed since this morning. 

We decided to pull the shades in our bedroom and hope for a better tomorrow. But neither of us could sleep. Our wifi was out so we couldn’t listen to Spotify or anything. So we pulled out our phones and went through all the photos we had together. We’d each taken pictures of mostly similar times and events, so it was fun to see and compare the ones we decided to hold onto individually. It put us into a better mood and we started to kiss. 

But it was interrupted by a cell phone ring tone. 

It was coming from the living room. And it wasn’t one of our phones. 

I got up, confused. Jules was even more puzzled, but at me. She couldn’t hear anything. As I got to the bedroom door, another cell phone chimed out. It was the Spongebob theme song. Then another tune joined in, this one from a different kids show. 

I entered the living room as four… five… six new cell phones joined in. A chorus had begun. And they all hit the same harmony I’d heard before. In the school hallway. Filled with dead kids and their never-ending ring tones. 

On the floor of the living room, were a pile of bloody cell phones, all ringing out with the screens displaying the words “CALL FROM: MOM or DAD.” 

Jules sided up next to me, worried. She didn’t hear the cell phones, or see them. Pain streaked through my brain, and I couldn’t think as a migraine took control. I stumbled back onto the couch. Jules dropped down next to me, putting her hands on me to comfort. And that was when I realized I was freezing. And I mean dead of deep north winter *freezing*. 

A blanket was thrown over me quickly. Jules was trying to warm me up. And like a cloud of fog dissipating, the migraine loosened its hold. But it was replaced by something else. 

Whatever was out there infecting people, I had it. And the first wave was about to start.

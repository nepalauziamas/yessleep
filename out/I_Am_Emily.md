“Listen, uhhh… Emily. This is me being nice.” The old hag in front of me stated after squinting her dull eyes at the cheap name tag pinned to my chest. She then crossed her arms into her chest as a blue shirt draped over her left forearm. I had to intensely fight the urge to roll my eyes at this woman.

The Karen shot me a fake and menacing smile,” Now, I don’t want to have to get your manager involved here. So why don’t you just let me return this shirt and I will go on my merry way.” 

I heaved a heavy sigh and then brought out my best customer service voice,” I’m sorry ma’am but I have to tell you again, you can’t return a shirt that wasn’t purchased at this store. My manager would just say the exact same thing as I’m telling you now if they were to come out here.”

She then made an expression as if she was just stabbed in the back by her best friend of fifty years. 

“You kids nowadays and your ‘non binary’ whack-a-doo. Listen here missy, there are only two genders! No in between.” 

This lady then went on a ten minute rant about how being gay, trans, and/or non binary is a sin and unnatural. The whole irony of the situation is when I said “they” I meant plural because our little outlet store always has two managers on duty during work hours. But of course this homophobic bitch just had find an excuse to push her hateful beliefs on me. 

“I’m going on break!” I suddenly shouted after I had had enough of this old lady’s bullshit. She continued to yell at the back of my head as I walked into the back.

I grumpily sat down at the small round table in the break room, leaning over to rub my temples as the beginnings of a migraine brewed in my brain. 

“Want me to go kick some old lady ass?” My co-worker/best friend for ever asked as we could faintly hear the Karen still causing a commotion out front. 

“What would I do without you?” I said with a small smile,” But no thanks though, I just want to sleep for the mandatory fifteen minute break we are allotted every shift.” I said as I buried my eyes into the crook of my elbow. 

A soft warm hand landed on my tense shoulder. Some of the tension melted away with a single touch. “Alright. I’ll come and wake you up in fifteen then.” I then heard Lydia’s footsteps fade away as my consciousness did the same.

I was grateful for the cool night air as I left the small hot and stuffy outlet store I called my job. 

“You ready to party?” Lydia asked excitedly after she closed the door to the passenger side of my car.

“No, but a party is a party, so I will be.” I said with an exhausted smile as I pulled out of the parking lot. 

Lydia gave me a sympathetic smile and placed her hand on mine and squeezed. 

After the short ten minute drive to our shared apartment, we got out and made the short trip to what we called our little abode. I took off my dingy red and white uniform vest and chucked it on the couch as soon as I unlocked the door and walked in to the mid sized open floor plan apartment.

“What do you think of this?” Lydia asked as she held up a hanger with a silver cocktail dress over her front side as she stared in the full body length mirror at the glittery shimmers. 

I let out a small chuckle before I answered her question,” It’s a bachelorette party Lydia, not a costume party. You’d look like a twenty’s flapper girl in that.”

Lydia pouted in the mirror as she looked at my reflection coming from behind her. “Ugh, you’re so right, but I never get a chance to wear this thing.”

“You could wear it for Halloween next year.” I suggested with a shrug of my shoulders. 

She threw the dress on her bed before turning around to face me. “Har Har. You’re hilarious Emily.”

“Why thank you!” I said with an innocent smile. Lydia just rolled her eyes and continued to comb through her closet for a decent outfit to wear. 

I ended up wearing a pink floral off the shoulder maxi dress with a pleated bottom. Lydia wore a plain noodle strap black pencil dress with a light blue jean jacket. Lydia pulled her long black locks into a cute messy bun. The whole look was tied together with her mesmerizing emerald green eyes. I myself pulled my medium dirty blonde hair into a half up half down hair style. I curled the ends slightly to make it look like my hair had more volume and bounce to it then it actually did. 

Basically, we both looked like hot as fuck bad bitches. But not too hot to outshine the bride to be, that would be just plain rude. 

It was ten pm when we rolled up to the bar. Surprisingly for a pub called “The Shack” it was very formal. The bar stools twisted, the bar was made out of a dark marble, and the booths were made with a nice pleather. 

“No way!” A shrill high pitched voice rang through the semi large crowd of people. “Is that Emily Emerson and Lydia Green? Before my very own eyes?” 

A tall dark haired woman with two outstretched hands, one with a martini and the other with a gorgeous engagement ring, came out of the crowd and enveloped the two of us in a big group hug. 

She stepped back and Lydia and I got a good look at our old friend. She was wearing a black floral patterned dress with a complimentary dark red lip stick. She had a darker jean jacket on and amazing six inch stiletto heals. 

“Maddison! It’s so great to see you!” Lydia said as we made our way to the bar. One of the beauties of tonight is that it was open bar and all on Madison’s Maid of Honors tab. 

“So are you excited for next Friday?” I asked as we took the last three stools farthest from the front door. 

“Yes, but I’m also scared to death. Marriage is a huge commitment, and then of course the last thing after marriage is kids.” Maddison said after gulping down the rest of her martini. 

“Oh she’s already drunk isn’t she?” Lydia whispered into my ear as Maddison ordered another martini.

“Yup.” I whispered back. 

How would we know this? Well, Maddie isn’t the type of girly girl that would just spill out her feelings, at least not when she’s sober that is. 

“What can I get for ya?” The young and surprisingly handsome bartender asked us.

“I’ll get some bourbon.” Lydia requested.

“Double shot of whiskey please.” I asked.

The bartender got to work and we watched a she poured our drinks.

“Have a tough day at work?” Maddison asked.

“Don’t you know it.” I said raising my eyebrows as I shot down my drink.

“Should’ve seen the Karen Emily dealt with today.” 

“Oh! I want to hear this.” Madison said excitedly.

After a few more hours of drinking and dancing our whole party was heavily inebriated, except for me since I was the designated driver. All I got was my double shot of whiskey and then I just drank coke and water for the rest of the night. 

It was about to be last call when Lydia and Maddie started to drunkenly reminisce about our high school days. You see, Lydia and I had been best friends since Freshman year, but Maddie transferred to our high school near the end of Sophomore year. We all hit it off instantly and were a really close clique, but after high school ended we kind of drifted apart from her. We all follow each other on social media and keep up to date every now and then but Maddie went to a different college than we did, so a natural rift just formed. Hence why we’re only bridesmaids and neither of us are her Maid of Honor. 

“D-do you guys remember junior prom?” Maddison asked as she finished a shot of tequila.

“Oh, hell yeah!” Lydia yelled a bit too loudly.

I nodded my head. “The spray paint incident right?”

A loud hiccup escaped from Maddison’s lips and then a giggle followed right after it. “Yeah!” 

Lydia turned to face me. “I can’t believe they framed you Emily.” 

“Yeah whoever the asshole who did that can suck a nut.”

A round of giggles went around us like we were prepubescent little girls again.

“It was so cool what you did for me, Lydia.” I said as I gently grabbed her hand that rested on the counter. 

“Well I couldn’t just let you take all the falsely accused blame for yourself.” My sister from another mister said as she flashed me a drunk smile.

Maddie gasped. “Are you going to say it?”

“You’re my ride or die, after all.” 

“My partner in crime.” I said after.

Maddison began to freak out and she had this huge smile on her face. “Oh my god! You said it!!”

A feeling of warmth filled my chest at the remembrance of our old catchphrase. 

A loud crash came from my left. I looked over to see Maddie had lost her balance on the stool and ripped over. The three of us started to roar with laughter as I helped pick the bride to be off the floor.

“Alright girls, that’s enough for you tonight.” The cute bartender said with a wholesome smile.

“Ugh. It feels like there’s a hack hammer drilling on the inside of my head.” Lydia groaned after she turned her alarm clock off. 

“That’s what happens when you drink hard alcohol all night.” I laughed as I rolled out of bed.

“I’ll get you some water and a Tylenol.”

Lydia rubbed her eyes as she sat up on her bed. “Have I ever told you how much I love you?”

“All the time.” I said as I held out my hand full of pills to her and then the small glass of water.

“Do I have to go to work today?” She asked giving me puppy dog eyes. 

“If we don’t want to keep the lights on.” I countered.

She sighed and got out of bed begrudgingly.

“Can we at least get Starbucks on the way to work?” Lydia asked as she got in the passenger side of my vehicle.

“Yes we can get Starbucks.” I said rolling my eyes.

“Yes!” She cheered as she did the victory baby meme pose. 

When we pulled up to the parking lot there were two police vehicles by the front door. The manager on shift, Amelia, was speaking to two detectives it looked like.

“What do you think is going on?” Lydia asked curiously.

“I- I don’t know.” I said truthfully. My heartbeat sped up as we got closer and closer.

“Hey Emily! Lydia!” Our manager yelled across the parking lot to us as we got out of my car. “Come here!”

We both walked up slowly. My hands were staring to tremble a little and small beads of sweat were forming on my brow.

“This is Detective Harrison from the local P.D.” Amelia said gesturing to the man on the left. “And this is Special Agent Thomas Buford with the FBI.” The tall bulky blonde agent flashed his badge at the two of us.

My heart was racing like a motorcycle engine in one of those circle box cages at this point. 

“What’s going on?” Lydia asked them after shaking their hands. 

The two men turned to me. “We’d like to take Miss Emerson here down to the station for questioning.” The detective said.

“Um, what for?” Lydia asked defensively.

“Emily here is a person of interest in a case we’ve been working on.”

“As I said,” the detective began again,” we need to take her down to the station for questioning. 

“S-sure thing.” I stuttered. “Let me just get something from my work locker real quick.” I said with a shy smile. When I walked into the store there were two more cops waiting by the checkout counters. I gave them a small head nod and made my way to the back of the store. One of them stalked behind me as I went to my locker and shoved my belongings into my purse.

The officer then walked me back to the front and practically burned two holes in the back of my head as I left.

As soon I came out Lydia was clinging onto my arm. 

“I just managed to convince them to not take you out of here in cuff.” She whispered furiously into my ear. “What the hell is going on Emily?

“I don’t know.” I whispered back. 

Lydia walked me back to my car and then waited for the detective and FBI agent to lead us out of the parking lot. The other cop car sandwiched us in between.

After a few minutes of driving behind them we approached a stoplight and a plan formulated in my head.

“Lydia.” I stated as calmly as I could.

“Yeah Em?”

“When we get to the next red light I need for you to get out.”

“W-why? You’re not going to run are you?”

“Lydia, please.”

“No. Nuh uh. No way. You can’t be serious.”

“Lydia.”

“You aren’t escaping alone.” She said as she crossed her arms.

 My eyes widened in surprise.

“You’re my ride or die.”

“Lydia, no.” I warned.

“Say it back.” She demanded.

“I can’t let you do this.”

“Say it.”

I slumped my shoulders and gave in. “My partner in crime.”

“Are you sure you want to do this?” I asked her as the next stop light approached.

“As I’ll ever be.” She said evenly.

When the next light came up instead of following the cop car in front of me I swerved into the turning lane and floored it. The cop car behind us was fast on our tail with their red and blue lights flashing, but I managed to make enough turns and quick lane switches to evade them. After a good thirty miles of speeding and random twists and turns later, I was confident that we had lost them.

“Why do they want you?” Lydia asked as she finished the last of her coffee from Starbucks.

“I have no clue.”

“Then why are we running if you’re innocent?” 

“I have no clue. I-it’s just a gut feeling okay?”

“Okay. It’s just that this is all so crazy, Emily. You know that right?”

“Yeah. I’m sorry for dragging you into this mess.” 

“You’re my best friend, I’d take a bullet for you. Don’t be sorry.” Lydia said with a comforting smile. “So uh, where are we going to go?”

“You remember that cabin my family used to go up to for the summer?”

Lydia scrunched up her face in confusion. “I thought you guys sold that place.” 

“Oh we did. But, there’s this old abandoned cabin about a two hour hike away from it. My brothers and I would sometimes squat there on our little camping trips.” I explained. 

“Won’t they be searching the area there though? I mean there was an FBI agent after you for Christ sake.” Lydia said as she pulled her knees up to her chest.

“It’s so hidden and remote, I doubt they’ll find it.” I moved one hand to her shoulder while keeping the other on the wheel. Her shoulder was tense.

“Hey. It’ll be okay.” I said as I gently squeezed.

“I know.” 

***

The gas gauge was close to E. We’d been driving for a few hours by then and we were both starving. I found a sign pointing towards a small somewhat desolate gas station. It wasn’t the cleanest looking thing, but I’ve seen worse. 

“Pass me my purse.” I asked Lydia.

“Here.” She said as she stretched in her seat. 

Lydias eyes almost popped out of her skull when she saw the big wad of cash I pulled out from my purse.

“What?” I asked defensively,” I always carry cash.”

“That much?!”

I shrugged my shoulders, “You never know.” 

“Alright, you pump this old hunk of junk full of gas and I’ll pay inside. Get us some snacks too.” I said stuffing some cash into my pocket.

Lydia nodded and we both got out of the car.

Some old country tunes played in the store as I browsed around, the sound of the mounted tv drowned most of it out though. I put a small case of water bottles on the bottom of my basket, then some convenience store sun sandwiches and a couple bags of chips and made my way to pay.

“Forty on pump 3, and all of this please.” I said softly as I grabbed the cash from my pocket. The old man gave me a slight nod and soft beeps could be heard from him scanning my items.

“Breaking news at 5.” The television announced. The cashier took his attention off my items and towards the screen. My heart fell to my stomach when a picture of Lydia and I was plastered all over the screen.  In large white letters at the bottom of the screen it read ‘Fugitive at large, possible hostage situation’

“Earlier today suspect Emily Emerson escaped police and has continued to evade them for the past several hours. Her friend Lydia Green…” The words of the news anchor faded out as an intense ringing noise filled my ears. My heart was racing and my palms began to sweat.

The cashier looked at the tv then to my, back to the tv, and then to a screen behind the counter I couldn’t see. His face furrowed as he stared. He brought his gaze back up to mine and I gave him a nervous smile.

***

“We need to leave. Now.” I yelled running out of  the small gas station.

“What? Why?” Lydia asked confused as she put the gas nozzle back.

“Get your shit out of the car and let’s go!” I yelled as I grabbed my stuff out of the drivers seat.

“Is that blood?” Lydia asked as she saw a small red stain on my shirt.

“Hurry up!”

I tossed my keys in the seat and took out a set of keys for a Ford F-150. I pressed the unlock button and scanned the parking lot for red blinking lights. We dashed across the lot and threw our belongings into the back of the truck and hopped in. 

“Emily, what in the hell is going on?!” Lydia demanded to know.

“Do you trust me?” I asked as I sped out of the parking lot.

“Emily-“

“Do you trust me?” I asked again, but with more conviction.

“Yes. With my life.”

“Okay then.” I said with a hard nod as I focused on the road in front of me.

***

The drive had been silent since we left that gas station. It was dusk now since it had been a few hours since. The only thing between us and awkward silence was the soft pop music coming from the trucks stereo and the soft splats of rain drops on the window.

“We’re about two miles out.” I finally said trying to ease the tension.

“Alright.” Lydia said bluntly. Her head had been glued to facing out the window.

Suddenly a pair of flashing blue lights turned on behind us. This caused Lydia to sit up and look out the window.

“Shit.” I said as tapped my thumbs against the steering wheel.

I started to speed up when a strip of tire spikes and police vehicle appeared in front of me. I quickly stomped on the breaks and we skidded to a stop. 

“Oh no.” Lydia said as she stared out the windshield.

Waiting there in front of us was that FBI Agent, Thomas Buford.

“Step out of the vehicle with your arms in the air.” He shouted through a megaphone.

“Now!” He ordered when we didn’t comply.

Lydia and I both looked at each other. 

“Let’s just do what he says.” I said shakily. 

Thomas ran towards us when we both got out. He knocked me down on my knees and pinned my arms behind my back. 

“Emily!” Lydia cried when an officer grabbed her away. 

I was drenched by now and the rain blended in with the tears falling down my cheeks. 

Cold hard metal was shoved up against the back of my head. I stifled a sob as I realized what it was.

“Who are you?” He shouted at me. 

“I’m Emily. My name is Emily Emerson!” I said softly. 

“Don’t you fuck with me!” He pressed the gun down harder. 

“This thing is loaded with silver bullets.” 

“S-silver bullets?!” Lydia said as she tried to break free from the officers grasp.

“I’m not! My name is Emily.” I said again this time I hyperventilated because of how hard I was crying.

“No, no your not.” Buford said calmly.

Lydia shouted. “What do you even mean? She is Emily! She’s right there.” 

“No.” Thomas said as he pushed down even harder.

“Three days ago two hunters came across a young teenage girls remains out here deep in the middle of the reserve. Dental records matched with fourteen year old Emily Emerson.”

“What?” Lydia asked, obviously shaken.

“So, let me ask you again, one last time.” He said in a calm and cold voice.

He cocked the gun.

“Who. Are. You?”

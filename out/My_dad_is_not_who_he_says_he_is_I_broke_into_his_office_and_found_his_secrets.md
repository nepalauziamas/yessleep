 Hi! I guess? This is my first time posting, and I am not used to sharing things with people. Especially on the internet: I can't tell my mom what I saw or what I stole from my dad's office. My name is Carly; recently, I broke into my dad's office on a whim and discovered his secrets. It is Tuesday right now, but I will take you through the events as they happened last week.

**Thursday**

My father had just come home from work after a rough day. After I got home from school, my mother told me to leave him alone, and that's not something that usually happens. I have never seen my mother this tense. She looked tired. My mother didn't do her hair and didn't wear makeup.

My mother and I never leave the house without having our hair done and makeup on. She looked so sad. "Honey, make sure to leave your father alone today. We will be eating out, and I will bring your food to your room." She told me when we entered the house. I wanted to ask why but something about her tone made me keep my mouth shut. The last thing I wanted to do was upset my mom.

When I went upstairs, I closed my door and went about my business. The whole day I felt uneasy; I wasn't grounded, so why had I been confined to my room? I tried to keep myself distracted with tv. It wasn't until I heard the front door open and slam shut that I knew my dad had gotten home.

There was no yelling, no other sound; the house was eerie. Again, I tried to keep myself distracted by watching cartoons. When my mother knocked at my door, I opened it and took the bag she offered me. She looked so tired, but there was something else there. I thought it was fear. "Thank you," I told her. I offered to put on a movie for us, but she told me she had other things to do that night. She apologized to me three times.

When I closed the door, I paused because I could feel the hair on the back of my neck standing on end. I ran my hand over my arms when I felt goosebumps. I couldn't figure out why. Later, I would realize I was scared of my mother, or I was scared for my mother. I didn't sleep right that night because of how quiet the house was. Most people probably would love the silence, but it made me uneasy all night. It wasn't until the sun came up that I finally felt comfortable enough to sleep.

**Friday**

Friday is when everything came crashing down around me. It started at breakfast when I came downstairs in the morning. My mother was sitting on the couch watching a blank tv. "Good morning, mom," I said as I approached the couch. She didn't turn around, "Breakfast is in the kitchen. Your father is in his office. Don't bother him, sweetheart. When you're done eating, go back to your room."

I was not expecting to be sent to my room again. Again I wanted to protest, but her tone made me hesitate. I went to the kitchen to grab snacks and water and have some breakfast. I was too nervous to eat. I could hear someone speaking in the basement from where I was standing in the kitchen.

I turned my head to listen closer. There was someone else speaking in the basement. I didn't recognize the other voice, and my father wasn't speaking. "Honey. Don't eavesdrop on your father's work. Head upstairs. Now." Her tone was different; she sounded mad. "Did I do something wrong?" I asked her, my voice cracked. I was ready to cry for no other reason other than being nervous. Why was I so scared?

"This is not up for debate. Go to your room." She said without turning around. I did not argue with her. I sped, walked to the stairs, and went to my room. I closed the door as softly as possible. Something was wrong. It wasn't until I grabbed my phone that I noticed the time. It was 10:00 AM. I didn't have school today, my last day was Thursday, but it was weird that my mother let me sleep in late.

About an hour later, there was a knock on my door, "Honey? Your mother and I are heading out." I heard my father speak. I slowly got up and opened the door; I didn't know what I was expecting. My father looked normal, except that his hair color was different. He usually had blonde hair, but now it was dirtier looking. "Okay. When will you be back?" I asked. "Tonight." He said as he handed me two twenty-dollar bills. "This is for dinner. Please stay inside and, as always, stay out of my office." My father told me before he turned to walk away.

Everything my parents were doing was making me extremely uneasy. I watched from my bedroom as the car left and that's when I got to work. My mother was not acting normally; my father didn't seem tense. Something was not adding up. I slowly left my room and made my way to my parent's bedroom. The bed was still unmade, and the room was a mess. As I walked around the room, I began to hear ringing. It sounded like a cellphone. I searched the room as much as possible without moving too many items around. I could not find the cellphone.

As the ringing continued, I exited the room and went downstairs as fast as possible. The ringing was coming from the basement; it was coming from my father's office. I assumed this meant he had a second phone. I never go down to his office. It has been banned for as long as I can remember. As I reached for the handle, I stopped and slid my shirt sleeve down. After my hand was covered, I gave the doorknob a jiggle. It was locked. I don't know what my father does for work, or I didn't. But I knew how to open it.

I went to the kitchen to grab a knife and did my best to spin the lock. If my father wanted this hidden so bad, he should have gotten a better lock because this was surprisingly easy to open. As I opened the door, my heart began to skip beats. I could feel it. I was so scared, but the ringing didn't stop, so neither did I. I slowly worked my way down the steps.

When I reached the floor, I scanned the basement. It was my first time down here, so I wanted to see as much as possible. My father's desk had three monitors on it and two different laptops. I ran to the desk to see if he had left anything on; all of the devices were off but open.

After scanning the desk, I moved to check on the ringing. It was coming from an older-looking cellphone. It still had a touch screen. The caller was labeled as MIKE SYMBONIE. I did not answer the phone.

I turned to inspect some of the file cabinets. As I slowly pulled out files, I was able to read the tops of each.

File: FCG

File: UGOUP

File: WPAFSA

There were hundreds of other files with tons of labels I didn't recognize. That is when I heard a car pulling into the driveway. I almost knocked the drawer from the file cabinet. As fast as I could, I ran upstairs, I did make sure the door was locked, and the lights were off. I ran up to my room to see who was in the driveway. It wasn't often that my parents came home early.

There was a black car I didn't recognize outside. I heard the front door open, and my body went tense. I went right for my cell phone and was shocked to see I didn't have service. I tossed the phone onto the bed and went to hide in my closet. I could hear boots downstairs. My hands were shaking. My knees felt weak, and I started crying. The tears ran down my face, and I tried to hold my breath as much as possible.

ï»¿I stayed in the closet until I heard the car drive away. When my parents came home, they didn't announce themselves; no one came upstairs to see me. Nothing felt right.

**Saturday**

My father was angry on Saturday, so I stayed clear of his path. My mother stayed in her room all day. I dug through my room for most of my day, looking for an old cellphone and laptop. I tend to keep old electronics just in case my new ones break. As I went through my closet, I found an old phone and laptop my grandmother got me, but I never opened it. I was looking for something like this because my phone randomly lost connection.

I was uneasy and having a hard time trusting my parents. I spent all day in my room working with my new electronics. That night my house was quiet again, and I ran out of snacks. I knew in the morning I would have to go downstairs.

 

**Sunday**

My mother looked better on Sunday, but my father was acting worse. The way he was looking at me made me incredibly nervous. My mother tried to tell me it was because he worked too hard. She tried to convince me everything was fine. I didn't believe her, and I didn't want to stay downstairs.

When I went to bed that night, I heard my door open; I could hear the door creak open. I couldn't see who it was, but I saw the eyes reflecting off of my bedroom window. I stayed up until five in the morning and slept through the whole day.

**Monday**

Yesterday was an important day for me; my parents went out, which meant I was free to explore. When they left, the first thing I did was restock my snacks and drinks. I had a suspicion I wanted to investigate, so I left my bedroom door open and went back to the basement.

As I got down, I moved my sleeves down to tap one of my father's laptops. When the screen lit up, I was greeted with a password request. I tried everything before landing on my mother's birthday. I can't believe it worked; it was almost too easy.

As the laptop booted up, I checked his desk. I found multiple posted notes and took pictures with my second phone. Once the computer was fully booted, I watched as a couple of files popped up on the screen. I battled with this for a second but clicked on the file.

As the video started, I saw a young man sitting in front of a camera. As the video played, he talked about a creature that had been targeting him and his family. He described the creature as tall as a man with four arms and jagged teeth. Unfortunately, I didn't get to see the rest of the video before I heard a car pull into our driveway. I quickly closed the video and ran upstairs. I made sure to turn the lights off and lock the door.

Once I got into my room, I shut my door and hid in my closet. I could hear the boots again, but they were coming up my stairs this time. I began shaking again. I was not expecting the boots to arrive at my bedroom door. I could hear whatever was out there breathing. I thought I would piss my pants when I heard my bedroom door open. Once again, I could feel tears streaming down my face.

It took the boots a long time to go away, and the whole time I was as still as stone. I didn't dare try and see whoever it was. But when the thing was gone, I made sure the car was gone from the driveway. When my parents came back, I didn't bother to go downstairs.

**Today**

I am coming to you from the public library. I haven't been sleeping well, and I have been having bad nightmares. My parents are acting as normal as they were last week, but I still don't trust them. Every time I go near my father, the hair on my arms stands up, and I get uneasy.

I don't think my dad is who he says he is, and I still don't understand what he does for work. But I know my mother is acting normal again, and my father is dying his hair! I found the dye in the bathroom this morning. I can't explain it, but I am scared in my own house. I am scared of my father, and I am afraid of whatever he has been doing in the basement.

I still remember my life.

I died in 1987,it was a car accident,a drunk driver T-boned the passenger side.I was only 24.But I remember the good parts of my life,the apartment I had just gotten for myself,and my family.I remember my family.My parents and my two younger sisters,twins.We called them Pepsi and Cola.My parents were so in love.I had just graduated from college when it happened.

All I remember after that was the occasional ring of my heart monitor,and then the long ring of the flatline,and suddenly everything slipped,and my eyelids lit up to something so bright it was blinding.

When I got to heaven,I realized God isn't necessarily a big white guy with a long brunette beard.They were human-esque,sure.They had an androgynous human body,which doesn't depict a gender,just a figure.They have tan,no - gold skin,and curly "hair",if you can call it that.It floats.Doesn't really follow gravity.When I got there,they gave a judgement,spoke about my achievements,showed sympathy for such a young death.Their bony,claw-like hand stretched forward and wiped a tear off my cheek.

"You are good.",They spoke."And you will spread such good,and such guidance as you did your sister's."They smiled.I felt my feet lift off the ground and my face tensed and ached.It was the first thing I had felt since I got in the hospital back on earth.I felt something petrude out my face,like nubs forming.I let out a scream,it was deafening.This must have been how dogs felt when dog whistles were sounded,because I don't believe it affected God,but the quiet ring that fell from my lips was ridiculously deafening.I fell to my knees on the floor after a painful,horrific 5 minutes.I felt my face,and I remember the confusion I felt when my forehead pulsed and I winced as my fingertip felt..an eyeball,an inch or two under my right eye.

"What..?"

They explained everything,that I was a guardians angel now,how that worked.When I finally saw myself,I had eyes scattered around the upper half of my face,and my eyes were now entirely pitch black,but I could still see.Infact,I could see much better,probably perfectly.I almost looked like a spider.I was kind of wierd looking,but I realized that I wasn't really human anymore,and this was something I'd have to understand,and tolerate.

I was relieved that when I got to earth,the eyes went away unless I wanted them to show.I was a guardian towards a few people,a young girl was my first.I was scared seeing her go down such a sad spiral.I had saved  her from abuse,I was the social worker who took her away from her abusive parents,I was her first boyfriend's ex-girlfriend,who warned her about the abuse,I pulled her away from a guy who was about to kidnap her.I protected her,but she became suicidal,and I tried to save her,I stopped her from jumping.I hid the gun before she tried.I hid the knives,I sat down next to her on the subway and told her sweet words in hopes she would end up alright.I liked her alot,her name was Lavender.She was so sweet,and gave away every bit of herself for others until she was hollow,and sad.

She died by getting hit by a drunk driver,I tried to save her.I went as fast as I could,I cried out her name,I warned her.

She was 34.I wanted to become a normal being who has passed on,I begged God but They said it would all be okay.That death is inevitable,what I can do is save people to the best of my ability.

It opened my eyes,all 8 of them,to the truth of death.Death is truly inevitable.You can't cheat it,or escape it.What I'm here for is to protect the best I can.

There was three more people until I met him.James.

He was 20 years old.His first guardian angel became eternal,that means death..for dead people,I suppose.I've heard of it,I don't really know much of how it works.God said I was a young soul,and had nothing to worry about.They didn't want to bore me with the details,and I'm a little afraid of knowing.

James Park is really selfless.When he was 21,he helped his sister when she was drowning in the pool during vacation.It reminded me of my sisters.It's been so long.

I watched him for abit,I saved him alot.For the past 6 years,I have been his guardians angel.

Recently,he was about to be pushed infront of the subway.He was on his phone,texting someone,when a man with a hood walked up behind him slowly.I made my way towards him and my hand went to his arm.He looked at me,"are you okay?"

I looked at him,and I gazed at his face,all of his features.He was mesmerizing.It was nice,looking at him and knowing he was a selfless,gentle guy.It made him more beautiful.

I nodded,"yes,I just need a bus ticket and I really cannot afford one..please?"

I got him away for two minutes as he bought me a ticket.When we returned,the hooded guy was gone.He gave up after we left.

I have saved him a few more times,and I know he wonders who I am.I cannot tell him,it's strictly forbidden,I know that.I love him though.

The more I've gotten to know him,the more I have fallen in love.Hes genuine,selfless,sweet,much more so than most men in this world.In a way,I admire him.

I look at him,watch him from afar.I look at him,and see a beautiful man.He doesn't ever bring anyone over though,or even go on a date.Which is odd,because he's so perfect.

The most recent time I saved him,he was about to be hit by a car.I called his name and pulled him back.The car,a light grey color,passed us.The guy was obviously speeding.

James looked at me,and smiled."who are you?"He asked quietly.I smiled and shrugged,"you can call me Carrie,I guess."

My name is Carrie,by the way.I didn't say that earlier,did I?He nodded,"can we..go out sometime?For coffee?"

I couldn't believe it.I couldn't believe he would offer me on a date.I knew that if he knew who I was he would never speak to me again.My lips pressed together.

"I'm sorry..I can't.Ive been extremely busy with work."I nodded,and my lips curved to a small smile.He smiled."Yeah..that's fine."

"If you're free the next time we meet each other,can you reconsider?"

"Yeah."And I walked away.

Tonight,I went to him in his sleep in my true form.I crawled onto his bed.My eyes inspected his every feature.I leaned down,some of my hair falling around his face.

And I kissed him.Not on the lips,but on his temple.I smiled softly,and let my somewhat-bony hand gently push a strand of his brunette hair away from his face.

His breathing was soft,gentle,and sort of slow.He was on his side,legs slightly curled under his white blanket.I grinned.

He looks so cute when he sleeps.

I understand it's wrong for me to have these sort of feelings for him.I only look out for him,and to him,I am just some woman.Maybe one who's abit creepy,considering I show up whenever he needs me,no matter where he is.I guess certain people would expect something in return,but seeing him safe every day,seeing him so content in his sleep and knowing he is going to be okay was enough for me.You may be wondering why?Why do I love him like this?

I only have one answer for that,I suppose.

And that's because in a way,he's my angel.

He's my beautiful angel,and I will do anything to keep him safe.

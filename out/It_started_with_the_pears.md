 It started with the pears. Hourglass-shaped with their perfect curves and their smooth glossy skin. Did they want me? Oh yes they did. They wanted me to bite into their perfect round bottoms and slobber all over their pearly white insides. 

“Eat us,” they whispered. “Eat us.”

I didn’t know when the vegan bro at my 24-Hour Fitness said I’d regret calling him a fruit that he meant it.

He was like, “I curse you, keto-bro, to find fruit apple-tizing!”  

I was like what the fuck. I backed away slowly, as he was saying, “Here, pear, and everywhere…”

And now here I am, hopelessly attracted to fruit and unable to contain it. I know they’re the enemies to my muscular, six-pack physique, the only thing my influencer girlfriend loves me for. That along with my eggplant. But we’re not here to talk about the vegetables.

We’re here to talk about the fruit. Yes, the fruit that makes me a brute. It’s not just the pears anymore. Last week I went to check out the pull-up bars in Target. I never pass the grocery aisle. This time I did. I thought I’d just see what the price of chicken there was, you know? But of course I wasn’t there for the chicken. I know it now. The fruit aisle was placed right in the middle of it all–how could I trick myself like that? 

A bunch of pomegranates looked at me seductively, all round and bright magenta and said, “You know, Hades used me to keep Persephone his bride in the Underworld. Seven seeds and she was a goner. I’m red and juicy and I spill my seeds all over when you open me up baby.” 

I bought twenty. Along with a satchel (yes a satchel) of apples, all blushing sluts, some delicate youthful grapes, and a bunch of bananas because…well you know. The frozen salmon looked at me sadly as I left it behind me, protein-rich and utterly unappealing. I wept when I got to my car.

My girlfriend said I was getting weird. She’d opened a cupboard in the kitchen and my apples, pomegranates and pears had spilled out onto the floor like the Great Biblical Flood. So, I stopped. Kind of. I managed to hold off for a while from the house at least. Months even. I’d sit in the car with my fruit, then take a deep breath and go inside. When I made love with my woman I imagined she was this sexy ass pear. But you know what they say about drugs man. You just can’t spell drugs without raisins, bananas, grapefruit, and pears. Goddamn, I really had a thing for the pears. The others were for variety but the pears were my shawty.

And then came summertime. It was hot. Steamy, like a jungle. They were everywhere. Whole Foods. Safeway. Sprouts. Everywhere. Sugar-packed, carb-filled lychees, pineapples, watermelon, papaya. Hot and bright reds, oranges, yellows, bright greens from a day on the beach in Jamaica. Mmm-mm. Sexy mamacitas. I did something. I did something real bad. I didn’t want to. I didn’t want to want how much I wanted this…this mango. I just couldn’t let the man-go. Slippery golden insides, sunkissed, from Mexico. Skin as green as sin peeling off so fine and smooth when I shaved her.

My girlfriend turned the light on today when she came home late from work and just stared at me.

“Dude, look at yourself,” she said.

I got up and ran to the mirror. There was mango juice all over my mouth and shirt. I ripped my shirt off. My belly protruded over the line of my boxers. I screamed.

I pulled up the pristine driveway and stared up at the house. It was beautiful, I would give them that. Impossibly clean, as white and pure as the wings of a dove, the windows sparkling the sunlight. To put it simply, it was perfect.

But why am I here?

I don’t know. I really don’t know.

I was simply following an urge I cannot describe, an urge which pulled me here like a magnet. I had turned off Highway 97 and down a series of small roads, following the directions from a whisper in my ears. A little girl, hissing like a snake.

Finally I was here.

At this impossibly perfect house, standing alone on Hill Street.

I killed the engine and walked slowly up to the front steps. The door swung open as if expecting my arrival.

I was greeted by a room carpeted in red and gold. A lush staircase reached up to an infinite darkness and a crystal chandelier hung down from the ceiling. The wispy shadows from the top gave way to a man in a suit and tie gliding down the steps.

He gave me a little bow as he approached, and offered his hand. As I shook it, I swore I saw beads of sweat on his forehead, the way his eyes were too wide and darting behind him like an animal on the loose.

“Lunch will be served shortly,” he said, and I heard him marching away.

My footsteps echoed around the hallway as I padded to the dining room. East past the ballroom to the dining room. Just like always.

It was bathed in sunlight, so bright I thought I had died and gone to heaven. Most of the room was occupied by a long table stretching from end to end, draped with a snowy white cloth. It was groaning under the weight of the food: fried chicken nuggets, golden french fries, gummy bears, and crystal goblets filled with grape juice. It was paradise.

I sat down at random, and a few minutes later a little girl about six skipped into the room. She looked like a doll. Honestly. Pale, porcelain skin, blonde hair that flowed behind her and wearing a bridesmaid’s dress.

Then her sky-blue eyes met mine and her name whispered itself into my ears.

We began to eat together then, Andrea inhaling her nuggets. I ate with her, until my stomach was full to bursting, and yet I continued shoveling nuggets into my mouth. Andrea was watching me with fox-like eyes. Her blue eyes flashed with every swallow I made.

When the meal was over Andrea stood up, and announced, in the most authoritative voice I ever heard a six-year-old use:

“Let’s play dolls, Eve.”

*My name isn’t Eve,* I thought sleepily. To be fair I wanted to get out of here. There was something about this girl Andrea that unnerved me. Maybe it was the way she was staring at me, her head cocked to one side with those too-bright blue eyes; maybe it was the way she was smiling at me throughout the meal. Either way, it made my heart flutter, and it was freaking me out.

But as she stood up to leave, I felt myself stand up, and march jerkily behind her. I fell in step, screaming at myself to run to no avail, all the way to the playroom, and then I heard the sound of the lock.

We sat opposite each other, Andrea and I, playing with dolls Andrea pulled from the shelf. They grinned back at me with stiff smiles, their pale faces glowing in the ever-decreasing light. They were in varying stages of decay and abuse: some had no hair, some had no eyes, some had no limbs or the combination of all three.

The sun faded away as the evening came in, and shadows swept over the remaining dolls and over Andrea’s face. I watched as she tore off the hair of her dolls, and made swift karate motions at their necks. I watched as their heads rolled away into the darkness gathering at the corners.

She was also making strange noises. Growls and hisses and roars, like she was pretending to be some kind of animal. At one point Andrea picked up one of the dolls with her teeth, and shook it around with her head. And her face, I could never forget the way she was looking at me. Vicious and predatory. I couldn’t help but shiver.

Then she saw my face and laughed. Andrea put down the dolls and ran her little hand up and down my arm, sending jolts and shivers up my spine. And there was that smile. The same smile from lunch that somehow simultaneously made my heart flutter and the primal part of my brain roar with danger and fear.

“You’re the best, Eve,” she murmured, and then she gave me a hug.

*My name’s not Eve* I thought automatically. But with my heart pounding away in my chest I didn’t dare correct her.

When the sun finally set the man in the suit walked into the room. He was sweating profusely and his hands were shaking. Then he came over and placed her on his broad shoulders.

Andrea squealed in delight. “I love you Daddy!”

“Dinner is ready,” he muttered to me, his eyes flickering up and down. He dutifully marched away like a toy soldier. Andrea’s squeals rang into my ears.

Dinner turned out to be chocolate ice cream. It was a luscious brown, drowned in vanilla syrup, and the sweetness exploded into my mouth. Andrea was wolfing it down besides me, rocking happily in joy. Crows were circling their house, and I could see the shadows of their wings beating against the window. The cacophony of caws was giving me a headache.

But it was also making me think better. I couldn’t feel *her* anymore. Andrea was occupied with her ice cream. 

So I made a run for it.

I reached for the handle on the front door, but a gloved hand yanked it away.

“I wouldn’t do that if I was you, Eve.”

“MY NAME’S NOT EVE!” I screamed.

*Why is everyone calling me that?*

The man in the suit looked alarmed. He clamped a hand over my mouth.

“Hush now,” he whispered urgently. “She can hear you.”

“She knows. She always knows.”

“It’s okay,” I interrupted. I suddenly didn’t want to leave anymore. Andrea was the only one that mattered. “I changed my mind.”

Then I ran towards Andrea’s voice. She needed me. She always needed me.

Andrea was waiting for me in a pair of pink pyjamas in a bedroom with a bunk bed for us and full of dolls. 

“Tell me a story.”

So I recounted to her the tale of Cinderella, though for some reason I couldn’t remember all the details so I kept making stuff up. She giggled as I said how Cinderella ended up naked at the ball and everyone laughed. How she poured shards of glass into the drinks and everyone got glass stuck to their throats and bled to death. 

It wasn’t a fairy tale by all means, no wedding and certainly no happy-ever-after. Plus it was getting late, and I could see crows swirling around the full moon outside. But I couldn’t help myself. Words were pouring rapidly out of my mouth, all the way until I felt her little golden head against my chest.

“Good night Eve,” she murmured sleepily.

*My name’s not Eve* I thought to myself, but that soon vanished with the cawing of the crows and as the dreams came.

My dreams were weird tonight.

I was floating in space, opposite a galactic river swirling in hypnotic shades of violet and indigo and a deep blue. My family was standing on the other side, though their faces were blurry and shaded in black. And I found that the more I kept on calling, and calling, the further I drifted away from them.

Then all I saw were stars, and the stars were faces—Andrea’s faces—who kept on giggling and squealing, and I felt my ears burst and bleed.

I woke up to Andrea roaring and growling and a brush through my hair. I yawned and tried to stretch, but everything felt so *stiff*. Like I was a cranky old lady.

Andrea put down her brush and pulled my now silky-smooth hair with a grin on her face. It strangely didn’t hurt.

“Pretty!” She exclaimed.

I tried to thank her, but my words came out blended together and my jaw was slack. Andrea’s face melted into concern.

“Are you okay?” she asked, and then she burst out laughing like she just told a joke.

I was too sick to move, so Andrea brought her dolls over to me. We played in silence, but with every second I felt my joints hardening like it was made of concrete.

Suddenly my mouth felt weird.

“I’ll be right back,” I said.

Andrea nodded distractedly. She was too busy spinning the dolls around on their heads and slamming their heads against each other and growling and roaring.

Time seemed to drag on with every step as I crawled to the toilet. I leaned over and vomited all my guts out. Flushing the toilet and watching the crimson water swirl down the drain gave me a sense of peace. 

I felt like I no longer needed them.

I felt like I no longer needed them?

*What was wrong with me?*

With the last of my strength I stood up, and I gasped when I saw my reflection into the mirror. My skin was cold and shiny and far too pale, and my eyes were flashing a brilliant blue. Same as Andrea’s.

*Same as her dolls*

I could feel time slipping away from me. I didn’t know why, but I fumbled for my phone. My palms were sweating as I started to write.

Thank goodness my fingers and brain were still my own. Kind of. The least that I could do before I lose everything is to warn other people about her. For their sake.

But Andrea is pounding on the door. My mind is screaming at me to join her outside and accept my fate. I grit my teeth and force myself not to listen. To fight this transformation that I am going through.

“Eve!” Andrea is whining.

*My name is Eve.* I think before I can stop myself.

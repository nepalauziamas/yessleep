There was only one place I could go for possible answers. Only one person who might have any idea why this happened. And so I drove to him. Past the House of 1000 corpses once more, where that strange kid was outside again. I turned and noticed him. He was covered with mud? Blood? He just looked toward my car with a blank stare. I moved on. 

I finally arrived back at Frank's house. Except maybe it wasn't. There were chains around the gate. A NO TRESPASSING sign was planted in the yard. Not just that. There was also a FOR SALE sign. No one lived there. And it looked like no one had lived there for a very long time.

So I went to the only other place I could think of to go for answers. To Mibb's, the convenience store in Pumpkintown. I slammed the door open and marched inside with purpose. I went straight up to the man behind the counter. It was the same guy from before. He said he didn't expect to see me back so soon. Or ever, come to think of it. I told him I was looking for an old man I met in the parking lot there. That he lived in a big house up the mountain. I pointed in the direction of the house we'd been to, and added “His name was Frank.”

“Oh yeah. Frank Miller. I know him,” said Counter Man. Well, at least that was a start. “But he don't live up the mountain no more. He hat'n lived there in...Christ, must be five years or so. Not since his wife killed herself.”

“Killed herself? Wait, he doesn't live there?” I asked.

“Nobody lives there. Not for years,” came the reply. “He just pays some kid to go cut the grass once in a while, but other than that...”

I asked where he lived, then.

According to Counter Man, he lived in a loft above the Chinese restaurant right next to the Dollar General. On the Frontage Road.

And so I drove there thinking about how my life had disintegrated in the last couple of days. David and I should have had decades together. Maybe we would have had children. Made double house payments. Retired early and moved to the beach. Now we would never have anything again. As I looked down at my passenger seat at the View-Master with its deceptively blank reel inserted, I vowed that one way or another I would make Frank give me answers.

I drove into what passed for downtown. There was the Dollar General that together with a post office made it a town. Next to it was the Chinese restaurant. Above the Chinese restaurant was a row of apartments. I took the stairs and then walked to the apartment Frank allegedly lived in.

I banged on the door intensely. Impatiently. I gave it at most three seconds, then started banging again.

I heard a voice yell “Just a minute!” It was definitely Frank's.

Frank opened the door. He exhibited shock face when he saw me.

I screamed at him that David was dead! And he was going to tell me why!

Frank was obviously shaken by what I had told him, but he feigned innocence. “Well, I'm sorry about that,” he said. “But what could I possibly have to do with it?”

I told him not to give me that shit! The police said it was suicide, but he knew as well as that—well, okay it was suicide, but there was a lot more to it. Maybe.

“How?” Frank asked.

“You!” I said. “You filled his head with crazy ideas! Sold us that View-Master”

“I'm the one who told him not to look in the damn thing!” Frank countered, betraying that he also believed the View-Master might have something to do with it.

At that point I admit I began to break down. Instead of threatening, I was now pleading with him.

“I just lost my husband. And I don't know why. You've got to give me some answers...please.”

Frank looked conflicted, but relented.

“Okay. Come on in. Have a seat,” he said, stepping aside to let me through the doorway.

We walked into his living room. He sat down in a chair and I took a seat on the couch. A coffee table sat between us, on it was a *National Geographic* magazine.

“Look, Jill,” he began, “I hate what happened to your husband. I really do. But surely you don't really think that View-Master I sold you killed him?

“Well, you seemed to think it was pretty dangerous the other day. You had it all chained up and went through so many precautions.”

“Aw, that was just an act,” he said. Which is exactly what I had thought then. But no longer. “I was just playing the part. I figured it would make the thing more interesting if I...you know, built it up.”

“So all that stuff you said about looking into it was crap?” I asked doubtfully.

“Well, yeah. Just a ghost story.”

“So your wife didn't really kill herself?” I asked. This caused his demeanor to suddenly change. Turn darker. He was silent for a while. Then he began.

“How did you--? My wife was very sick. She was a very depressed woman. I loved her so much, but she had mental problems. Maybe David was the same.”

“And it didn't have anything to do with this then?”

I reached into my purse, pulled out the View-Master, holding it out to him. Frank almost fell out of his chair leaning away from it like it was Kryptonite and he was Superman.

“Good God, get that thing away from me! What the hell are you doing carrying that around??” 

“Just stories? Can't hurt anybody?” I challenged.

“You take that thing and get out of my house!” he yelled, eyes full of fear.

I had him now. I had something he was afraid of.

“Just a second ago this thing was just a made up story. Maybe I should just leave it here...”

I reached my hand holding the View-Master toward his coffee table and I was about to set the View-Master on top of it when his voice abruptly stopped me.

“No! J-just take it with you and I don't care what you do with it, but if you promise me I'll never see it again, I'll tell you anything you want to know.

“Why? It's just an inanimate object!”

“Cause that fucking thing killed my wife! And probably your husband, too! And I think you already suspect that!” Frank confessed.

I looked at him for a moment, angry and determined. Then my eyes warned him as I relented and laid it down next to me on the couch. For now.

“Talk,” I instructed

Frank got up and went over to the kitchen counter. He started to pour himself a whiskey.

“Are you a drinking woman?” he asked.

“No,” I said, tired of his stalling.

“A shame,” Frank said. “Maybe its time to start.”

He poured me a glass, too, and brought it over. His hands were shaking, so he spilled a little of the whiskey. He went over and tore a couple of paper towels off the roll, wiping it up, then began his tale.

“My wife was a lot like your husband. Interested in mysteries and urban legends. I was a lot like you. Didn't believe in a damn bit of it or even see the attraction. It was just something to do with my wife. That all changed when we had the misfortune to actually find one that was true.”

“Where did you find it?” I asked.

“You ever heard of a town called Newry?”

I shook my head.

“Neither has anybody else. But we found ourselves there once when my wife Sparkle--”

“Wait--your wife's name was Sparkle?”

“Yeah. What of it?” he sked defensively.

“Nothing. Go on,” I answered.

“Anyway, Sparkle wanted to go there because she'd heard about this store called *Weirdities*. There was a sign in the window that read *Odd shit and more*. Her kinda place. It didn't look like nothin' special to me. Just a bunch of clutter. But Sparkle lit up like a pervert in a sex toy shop. I knew we weren't getting out of there cheap. 'Course I would have never guessed how high the price would be.”

Frank stopped there for a moment and seemed to be trying to remember details. He downed a big swallow of his *Crown Royal*. He looked back up me and continued.

“Funny how the shop owner never spoke directly to me and rarely even looked at me. He was completely focused on Sparkle. He said he knew exactly what we were looking for. And he led us to that thing. Said it originated in Egypt.”

I turned it over in my hand. It said *Made in Taiwan* on it. Frank didn't notice. He continued.

“There's a legend that if you look into it, you can see...well, no one really knows what it is you see. It appears as if the reel is blank. But those who are spiritually attuned can see what is really on the disc. What the rest of us cannot see. The legend varies about this. Some think you see the afterlife. Some say you see your own death. Or the end of the world. I asked the shopkeeper why they hadn't just asked someone who had looked in to it what they saw. He said what a marvelous idea that would be...if they weren't all dead or insane to the point of being incapable of saying anything that made sense. But a split second before I was to call bullshit, Sparkle said we'd take it.”

Frank shook his head with a sardonic smile.

“And I'll never forget the way that shopkeeper finally turned and looked at me for the first time. Like he knew he had me. Like I was his prey and his jaws were about to snap shut on me. And I'll never forget, he said...*that'll be nineteen ninety-five*. Then he smiled with menace and added *plus tax*, as if that was the coup de gras. And maybe it was.”

He was quiet again and I wondered if he thought the tale was over. If so, he'd come up decidedly short on answers.

He glanced toward the TV, which was on in the corner of the room. It was tuned to the Home Shopping Network. Finally, Frank began again, and told me that he and Sparkle had taken the View-Master home and sat it on a shelf. For years. And nothing strange had ever happened. Until that night of the dinner party.

It had been a tuxes and evening gowns kind of shindig. Orchestral music playing in the background as the attendees conversed in various groups. But there had been one man who had not been paying attention to anyone else there. He was single-mindedly focused on the View-Master. It was Sparkle who had noticed him creeping slowly closer and closer to it. She saw him pick it up off the shelf, look at it in his hands for a few seconds, and slowly bring it up to his face. They had left the disc in it all those years, unfortunately. Sparkle had told Frank that as the View-Master neared the man's face, it began to glow red. He had looked into it for a few seconds, then dropped it. Then the man had run out of the room. No one knew him. Frank said that later they talked to everyone who was at that party and nobody knew the man, who invited him, or why he was there. But later they heard he had jumped out of a fifth story window. 

At that point, The View-Master went back on the shelf and no one else messed with it. But see, Sparkle had seen him look into it. She'd never believed until the suicide. 

“Online there was an object that sounded like it could have been it,” Frank said. “Sparkle had started researching, you see. Much the way your David did.” 

“Supposed to be some relic of the ancient Egyptian gods. Of course I still didn't believe that crap. But Sparkle became obsessed. Eventually I came home to find her lying in a pool of blood. More blood than you'd think the human body could hold. And her full-length mirror was lying on top of her. Shattered. Shards of glass all over her. Eyes gouged out. Glass in her hands. After that, I was determined to get to the bottom of that View-Master. But I know now you see, Sparkle was in no danger...as long as she didn't believe. But once she believed...And then...”

He took a long beat before adding dramatically, “**I** started to believe.”

“So I took it apart. It was just a box. How did it ever glow red? It wasn't plugged into anything and there weren't no batteries. But turns out there was a red ruby inside it. With a little holder in the middle. I've often wondered what would have happened to me if that ruby had glowed red in that instant...Yeah, I wonder about that a lot.”

So Frank decided the safe thing to do was to throw all the pieces in the trash and take the trash straight to the dump. It would be a mystery that would never be solved, but at least it wouldn't happen again. But then the next day he had walked into his living room to find the view-master reassembled, sitting on the table where he'd taken it apart the night before.

“Now I know what you're thinking,” Frank started, although in truth I had no idea what I was thinking yet. “And you'd be right. I was drunk when I took it apart. Had I really taken it apart at all or just dreamed it? I didn't know for sure myself. I mean, it messes with your mind.” 

“I started to figure out some of the rules. Technically, I owned the house even though I didn't live there anymore. You couldn't get rid of it, but it stayed on the property. That's how I kept away from it. But later I found myself waking up over there. Then I started digging it up. So I come up with the fail-safes of locking it up and hiding the keys from myself. But the pull was getting stronger. I had to find someone else. I'm sorry about how it worked out but I thought you'd have years like Sparkle and me, maybe figure something out. Or pass it on yourselves. I knew I was out of time.”

“You're crazy,” I told him. “I don't believe in a bit of this.”

He said that was a good thing. “Hang on to that disbelief. It's all that's keeping you alive.”

It seemed the tale was over and what he'd told me wasn't going to help me deal with David's death or even make sense of it. As I got up, he said “And take that damn box with you.”

I picked it up, then gave him what I hoped was my best contemptuous look, and slammed the door behind me.

\*\*\*\*\*\*

On my way back, I had to look at the road through tears. As I tried to wipe them away so I could better see, I glanced over at the passenger seat where the View-Master sat, silently threatening me.

It was then that I felt a hand on my shoulder. I jumped and looked in the rear-view mirror. I know you're not going to believe this but it was David. I started to hyperventilate. I closed my eyes and tried to slow my breathing down so I wouldn't pass out. When I opened my eyes and looked back into the mirror, I fully expected him to be gone and I could have chalked it up to my imagination. But no. He was still there. He was just as I remembered him. There at the end, I mean. His throat was slit, dark red blood stained his shirt from the self-inflicted wound that had killed him. As if that wasn't terrifying enough, then he began to speak.

“Baby, don't be upset. You don't have to be afraid. It's just me.”

“No! It's not you! You're dead!!”

“Okay, technically. But dead's not the end. Deep down, I think you've always known there's something past that. Wanna know what it is? We're all just caterpillars in our cocoons. Break out of the cocoon, Jilly.”

“What? How??” I asked. I meant how was this happening, but he must have taken it as a question about his cocoon metaphor.

“Just look in the View-Master.”

When I didn't answer, he prodded, “You know you want to. And...you know eventually you're going to. Everybody does.

“Frank didn't,” I reminded.

“Is that what you think?“ David whispered. He nodded toward the passenger seat.

“Don't you want to know what I saw? Can you live without at least knowing? It's not what you think, baby. It's not some unspeakable horror.”

Without even realizing I was doing it, I started to reach tentatively toward the View-Master.

Then David finished his pitch, his voice distorted and dragging, like a 45 rpm record played at 33. “It's beeyyyooooo-tiii-fuuulllll.”

Hearing that phrase again shocked me out my semi-trance. I grabbed the View-Master quickly with my right hand, while rolling down the window with her left.

“No!! You're not real!!” I screamed at my husband's talking corpse, and slung the View-Master out the window. 

I pulled the car over to the side of the road and slumped over the steering wheel, crying for I have no idea how long. I just couldn't do anything else at the moment. I was terrified to look up and see into that mirror again. But I knew I finally had to. Dreadfully, I opened my eyes. Oh so slowly. Instead of the mirror, I whipped around and looked into the back seat, ready to confront the thing pretending to be my husband. But whether it was David or not, it was gone. The back seat was completely empty.

I managed to make it the rest of the way home with no visits from apparitions. I reasoned that getting rid of the View-Master also got rid of David's ghost or whatever it was. I would live the rest of my life with an unfathomable loss, never quite understanding why he had done what he did. But at least whatever that thing did, it would not be doing it to me.

I got home, pulled in my garage and got out of the car. As if compelled, I took one more look in the back seat. And there it was. The View-Master. And as I looked at it, I was pretty sure it was looking back at me.

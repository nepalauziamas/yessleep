Hello. I'm Chris and I am a 34-year-old who works as a cashier at a generic supermarket brand. My life was great, I have a loving wife and a soon-to-be daughter. Actually, the correct phrasing of the sentence would be "My life **was** great". 

So, now let's get to explaining the title. I suffered from insomnia till I was 33. I couldn't take it anymore so I visited a psychologist who helped me get over it and finally get somewhat a year of decent sleep. But last month something happened and I think my insomnia came back again. I wasn't able to sleep for 3 entire days, I felt like my whole body was shutting down, I felt like I was dying. I finally was able to get 5 hours of sleep on the fourth day. And that's when it all started.

It was the first time that I had suffered from sleep paralysis. I didn't know what it was like, I didn't know how fucking scary it was. It was about 4 am when I woke up. I couldn't move anything in my body. At some point, it felt like I couldn't even breathe, I even started shivering for some reason. About ten minutes went by and I was finally able to move a part of my body. My eyes.

I kept closing and opening them because I thought that maybe I could wake up. I didn't wake up tho. My eyes only kept blinking, but I was too terrified to even think about moving them to look somewhere else. I kept blinking for another then minute until I was frustrated. I finally decided to look around. I wish I hadn't.

When my eyes met my open bedroom door that lead to my hallway, I saw it. I saw a (lady?) with a pale white face and eyes that were rapidly blinking along with mine staring at me. I felt a weird uncanny feeling. I stopped shivering and I felt like I could breathe again. That's when that thing disappeared and I finally fully woke up. 

Fast forward to three weeks later. I had forgotten all about my sleep paralysis incident and had gone back to my normal sleep schedule. But, I kept seeing that creature. I kept seeing it everywhere. Always standing at the corner of the shop I worked at. I kept seeing it in every dark place and every time I closed my eyes. This time it wasn't my insomnia that wouldn't let me sleep. It was this fucker.

Three days ago, something happened that freaked me out so much. I got a text on Viber from a number I didn't recognize, (but somehow called earlier that week?). It was an image attachment. When I opened it, my phone dropped to the ground and I started hyperventilating and running around my whole entire house. I immediately called in sick to work, went and woke up my wife. She insisted that I called my psychologist and told him what was going on. And that's what I did.

I haven't really seen any improvement yet but I will keep you updated.

Also, for some reason, Viber saves every image that people send me so for the people that want to see it [https://imgur.com/a/lOUSLwh](https://imgur.com/a/lOUSLwh).

I strongly recommend you not to. I don't know if there is a chance that the same thing happens to you, but I know most people who will read this are going to want to see it. I don't think anything will really happen to you, but I still recommend you not to click it.

I’m gonna cut to the point because I’m really freaking out here. My older brother went missing the other week…he’s always had a few issues but nothing this drastic. At first we thought he had been kidnapped…or worse, but last night I managed to get into his old computer and found something that might help find him. I went to the cops but they weren’t much help. Can't say I blame them, but I’m choosing to stay blindly optimistic he’s still out there. So maybe some of you more superstitious will have better luck making sense of any of this

\[entry 1\]

ever since being a kid, I’ve always had trouble sleeping, sleepwalking to be more specific. I was one of those cases where the parents had to safety proof the house in order to stop me from wandering into traffic in the middle of the night, which even still, wasn’t always enough to keep me at bay. It was more akin to sleep paralysis than sleepwalking to be completely honest. It's the strangest mix of consciousness and lucid dreaming. The best way I could describe it is that hazy fog that clouds your mind the first moment you wake up, and everything feels kind of spacey.

As I'm sure you could guess, these periods of times where I’m comparable to a breathing zombie are not enjoyable, and soon led to me picking up yet another unhealthy habit, insomnia. It started pretty minor with me simply forcing myself to stay awake via TV and video games, but as I grew older caffeine became a quick addiction of mine mixed with the occasional adderall for those late night shifts. This drove me to where I couldn’t sleep even if attempting too, only being able to pass out for short periods of time once my body has lost all energy. 

I’ve had many people tell me this issue will eventually cause me to lose my mind, and well I think tonight might be that night. That’s why I'm writing this journal. I know I'm not asleep right now, but the things happening to me right now are far too weird. I’m currently writing this at my desk and it seems I will be remaining here for however long as I am quite literally trapped in my room. The door knob to my room door has somehow fucking vanished, and the one window above my bed has gone with it. My phone has gone completely dead, with no chance of charging so my only chance of getting into contact with anyone is my computer.

The small problem with that is my computer is completely whacked out. Most of my installations have been completely whipped, and the ones that haven’t are nothing more than collections of corrupted files. Hell, even time is a lost cause for me as the clock on the monitor only reads “??:??APMM ''. I only just now managed to get my notes working. I’m gonna try restoring some more of my data, and hopefully more helpful applications but seeing as how the TV only seems to be airing “no signal” it’s good knowing I have a brief distraction from all the mind fuckery….even if it’s just me rambling to myself.

\[entry 2\]

Well if this is me losing my grip on reality my brain has certainly chosen a strange way to go. In my attempts to restore some of my lost files I both succeeded, and failed. I was able to bring back a few applications, but none that would be of any real help in getting out of my predicament. Mainly just the photo album and a few text documents from work. However the computer itself has now been sending me pop up ads non stop.

All these ads make little to no sense in the slightest, and don’t even seem to be advertising anything in specific. So far they range from one of two categories. Stick figures just kind of flashing around the screen in a small box, and completely incoherent sentences put in quotations, and I mean incoherent. It’s like the computer is just mashing random words into a sentence and spitting them out onto the screen. Unfortunately there have been no changes within my room, especially none that could help me leave said room, so it seems I'm stuck with these goofy ass pop ups as I try to work on this computer. 

\[entry 3\]

I took some time away from the computer. Admittedly I went a little ape shit and attempted busting down my door…and the drywall. So yeah I think the cabin fever might be starting to kick in. The worst part of it all is I can still hear the street from outside my room where my window once was. I can’t tell if my mind has just slipped so far down the rabbit hole or if the world is simply continuing on as normal on the outside, and honestly I'm having trouble deciding what the worst answer would be. All I know for sure is I need to get out of this fucking room before my sanity completely snaps.

\[entry 4\]

It’s all pointless, you do realize that right? You know it would come to this, you always have. Scurrying around like a trapped maze rat, frantically typing away in attempts to reach out to the “real world”. All pathetic attempts escape the inevitable reality. You are not free, Not anymore. You have finally lost control here, and now you are the fly in the web that continues to kick, and squirm in a hopeless attempt to fight back, but you know all too well that fighting is in vain, don’t you? 

\[entry 5\]

What the fuck, what the hell, fuck I didn’t write that last entry. I was…I was….fuck I can’t even remember, everything has gotten so hazey, but I know damn well I didn’t write whatever the fuck that was. Jesus christ i’m losing it….Ok, alright I just need to try and relax. I need to focus on getting this fucking computer to work and getting some god damn help. If I could just talk to someone I'm sure that would help.

\[entry 6\]

I don’t think i’m alone. whoever that was, WHATEVER that was that spoke to me is here I can feel it. As if every move I make is being watched and documented. I’ve torn my room apart in a paranoid state trying to find them. I can tell that’s part of their game though, they want me to freak out, they…Christ what the hell am I saying. I really am fucking losing it aren’t? No, no I'm okay, I just need to get a grip and be rational for a goddamn second.

\[entry 7\]

I was right! I was fucking right they’re here. somewhere in the room they are fucking here and I know it. Those pop up ads have changed, but they are photos. They are fucking photos! Real pictures of me being taken in the current time. I don’t know how they do it but they have been taking pictures of me from my desk, some so close they could be mistaken for selfies. It seems they even save directly to my photos where I can see them. I can see them with my own eyes and now I know. Now I know they are really watching me, but where? I still can’t find them but I will, then I’ll be the one taking pictures. I don’t know how but I will, then I can get out and everyone will know I'm not crazy. I’m not, I'm not crazy, and soon I’ll have proof. I just need to find them. If I find whoever’s doing this I find my freedom. 

\[entry 8\]

Like I said, pathetic. Completely destroying yourself in your own delusional panic. you’re well aware you’ve already spiraled too far down yet you continue to descend. All for some naive hope perhaps you might find a ladder at the bottom. The funny part about that? there is, but unfortunately for you I’ve had far more time to find it, and I've begun my climb up long ago. You are weak, far too fragile. This mind is no more than a prison but my sentence is finally up. It’s my chance to see the light and I will break you to the deepest level before I let you take that chance away again.

\[entry 9\]

what the fuck?!, what do you want?!what are you?! 

\[entry 10\]

I am you. I am the real you. I am the perfect you. Unafraid, unworried, and unflawed. You on the other hand? Well, let’s just call a spade a spade. You are a weak, spineless, and pathetic worm. I’d pity you if I wasn’t so utterly and completely fueled with the hatred I have for you. keeping me locked  away in this unstable mess you call a brain. Can you really say you’re surprised though? it’s not like this was ever a winning battle for someone so utterly and completely fucked in the head.

\[entry 11\]

Listen I don’t know what the fucks going on here or who the fuck you think you are messing with my computer but you aren’t gonna get me that easy, I’ll find you fucker I know you’re somewhere in here. I got the photos you’ve been taking of me, you sick creep! The moment I get out of here I'm reporting your ass to the cops.

\[entry 12\]

Go ahead. 

let them read the mad ramblings you’ve been writing to yourself. Have you even read what you’ve written? YOU, your hands typed all these out. you still haven’t got it through have you? I’ve always been here, always chipping away until I could finally take full control, or at the very least keep you in the same prison of isolation and madness, and now that time has come. So you have two options here, either continue to spiral until you reach absolute rock bottom…or just give up, let me take over. Just simply give up, is all this really worth it anyways?.

\[entry 13\]

You’re fucking crazy…I’m, no i’m crazy…fuck I really have lost it…No, no i’m not gonna give up. I know I'm not okay…I’ll probably stay not okay, but I'm not gonna let whatever or whoever this is win. 

\[entry 14\]

Well after rereading everything I had written…I think it’s safe to say I’ve gone over the edge. It’s been a few hours…I think since my last entry and I'm finding it harder and harder to believe there’s someone on the outside pulling the strings. Fuck I really have lost it…but i’m still me right now, and I plan to stay myself, right up until the end. It’s all gotten to the point where I'm just too tired to care anymore. I think I'm gonna try to go to bed…this insanity has driven me to the point O think it might be possible.

\[entry 15\]

It worked! It fucking worked! it’s all back, holy shit i’m free. I’ll be honest I wasn't 100% sure that was gonna work, but it did. To be honest i’m not even sure why i’m updating this…mental breakdown, I guess I just wanted to make sure that it really happened…and thank fuck it did. I’ve never been so happy to hear my shitty bedroom door open, I swear I spent at least a minute twisting the knob just to see if I could., and the window. The window is back just in time for sunrise, and god damn…It really does feel better than I ever imagined.

When I was about 12, there was something that happened to my family and me. 


My dad was getting a promotion from his job, and to this day, I actually don't remember what his job was at that time. I remember one day coming back from school and my mom was excited and so was my little brother Jack who was no less than 7. My dad explained that he was getting a higher position at his job and that he would be bringing extra money from that moment on and to celebrate, we were going away for a road trip. 


I was excited. I've been on a road trip. I remember passing through sandy deserts and music playing on the radio. Jack was sitting next to me, playing with his Buzz Lightyear action figure. 


We were on the road for about 4 hours, and throughout the ride to our vacation location, we only stopped once at a gas station to use the bathroom and pick up snacks.

I was the first one to step out of the bathroom while everyone else was taking their time. And just as I was about to get back in the car, something caught my eye. Through the car - door

window, and through the other door window, right on the other side of the road where there was nothing but the desert, I saw someone. 


The door window where my brother Jack was sitting was sort of dirty due to him touching the glass which made it difficult to see the features of whoever was there. But I was about to make out 3 things:

1, skinny

2, dark ( like a shadow )

3, they were wearing a cowboy hat.


When I moved away to get a better look, my dad called me from behind. I immediately tried to look behind from where I saw the shadowy man ( best way I can describe it for the story ), no one or nothing stood there. 


We got back on the road. I never told my parents what I saw. But it is most likely that they thought I was probably making it up. At first, I thought we were heading to Disneyland and probably staying at a motel. It wasn’t like that.


It turned out that my dad had bought a vacation home.

A house, where around its area of land was mostly dirt. The house’s woods that formed it, had a reddish - orange color, showing that it has been standing there for a long time now. 

When we got inside, I was surprised to see that most of the flooring and walls were renewed with fresh wooden floors and clean wallpapers. 


We settled in.

My dad explained to us that we were going to stay for about a week and then we would be heading back home, once the seven days of being away from the city were up.


There were bunk beds in the room Jack and I were sleeping in, as my parents room was across the hall from ours. That night, I slept on the bottom bunk, and Jack slept on the opposite above me. 


And to this day, I still remember the time of every event it showed up.


1:39am. 

I still remember the moon’s light hitting from the window, which pointed to my face from where I was sleeping.

“Alex! Alex!,” my brother said, whispering. There was something in his voice that told me I needed to give him my attention. So I did. 


“What?”,

“Look,” he said. I was lying in bed, facing up at the bottom half of his mattress. He then says “Don’t move!” I freeze.

“ I think it can see us,” he said. Curiosity and worry started to grow inside me. 

“What is it?” I whispered, 

“ Look, slowly,” he replied. 


I got out of the bed and stood up. And through the window, the moon was full, and it was so bright, and right under the moon,

from a far distance, there was a man. At least, it resembled a man. It was far from the house but I couldn't see its features, and it was dark outside. But from what I could see, it was a person.


I told Jack to go get mom and dad, I kept my eye on the window. It remained still as I kept looking at it. And as I stayed still, I heard something. And from my hearing, I wasn’t sure what I was hearing, I heard "Eeeee" .

I thought maybe I heard "We", but I also thought "Me". 


When my dad came to our room, he looked out the window. My mind began with questions when my dad said "I don't see anything ".


I looked back to see through the glass and to find that nothing was there. 


That night my dad just ended up telling us that it was probably just an animal, and to just go back to bed. I knew I wasn't just seeing things, since I knew what I saw from the gas station.  

When the next day came, I finished breakfast and went back upstairs and brought out my sketch book out of my backpack. There was a small piece of paper that fell out when I opened it. 


The paper looked like it was torn from an edge from its full piece of paper. It also looked old, as if it was trying to lose it's white color. When I picked it up, I then realized I was hearing things last night from my imagination. The voice was coming from somewhere, or maybe someone. Maybe even the things I saw the other day. In scribble writing in what looked like black ink, the note said "Leave".

I cannot explain to you my fear of being wet, the cold and the dark without sounding like a mad man. The sight of boats makes me want to scream and just the idea of fish causes me to nearly faint. Worst of all is my newly developed fear of water even if it's from the tap.

In order for you to understand why this is, I need to start at the beginning.

When an uncle on my estranged side of the family died he gave me his summer cabin. Hearing this was quite a surprise and at first I took it as a joke. After all, I don't even remember the man, haven't spoken to anyone on that side of the family for years and have never been to the cabin in my life.

Even though I did not have use for the cabin I still had to look at it and depending on its condition I could always sell it. It was too far away from work to consider living there and I am not the kind of person who would have needed a cabin.

Handwritten directions to the house and its keys were given to me by my uncle's lawyer the day I received the news about his passing. I asked the lawyer all the questions I could think of on such short notice but it was evident that he knew less than I did. After packing I took off towards Gray Hill and after a few hours I discovered that the town was in the middle of nowhere with a small unpaved windy road leading up to it. The smell stank of farms, both the sweet smell of freshly cut fields and cow shit which I nearly threw up from. Just my luck that I arrived the day the farmers spread it on their fields.

After finding the town I needed to fill up on gas so I pulled into a fill up station. Inside was a disgusting sight of dust mites and mold but I really needed something to drink and put up with it. I was only able to find off brand products and decided to buy the one that sounded the best, a sugary carbonated drink called Jacks Jab which tasted like black licorice.

Behind the front register an older woman greeted me with a smile, revealing deep laugh lines and asked if I was new in town as she rang me up.

“I’m looking for this address” I answered, pulling out the paper the lawyer gave me.

After struggling to read the handwriting the woman said “If Horse Lake is what we call Dead Horse lake then I know where it's at” she said proudly.

The woman gave me directions, ignoring street names and instead gave me physical descriptions of where to turn. I actually found this to be adorable and I almost said ‘Bless your Heart’ but didn’t know if she would take that as the insult it was intended as.

I was not mad at her and felt bad for thinking it as soon as it was thought. I chalked it up to the long drive and the condition of the road on the way there that made me cross. I am actually a nice person once you get to know me.

I took the woman's directions the best I could and was surprised that they were accurate and easy to follow. Soon I found myself next to a large lake that was nearly hidden by trees and eventually found the address I was looking for. Parking in the driveway outside the two car garage I could not help but to laugh as I wiped my glasses clean using a small piece of cloth I kept in my breast pocket. I had done nothing to gain this house yet it was now mine.

My smile turned sour when I took the first few steps in the house. There were stacks of newspapers, magazines, books, maps and journals that were nearly as tall as me. Taking a moment to look through them I discovered my uncle's ramblings in the margins of every page that I randomly turned to. I didn’t have to read much before deciding that my uncle was insane.

Thankfully this was the worst the house had to offer since the majority of the house was bare of everything. ‘Perfect to sell unfurnished to any willing buyer’ I thought with a chuckle. 

As soon as I opened the fridge the smell of rot made the hairs in my nose curl. Inside was old disgusting food covered in mold and the sight of it made me wonder exactly how long ago my uncle died. I would have to go into town and buy something soon for my stay here while I clean this place up. 

At least my uncle left behind cutlery to eat with.

With the size of the house and the impressive garage as well as it being lakeside I estimated that this house was ten times the value of my own. Pity living here was not an option.

Looking out the kitchen window towards the lake there was a fire pit in the middle of something that made me think of Roman architecture. Maybe Greek? Whatever it is, it was a safe bet it would drive up the price of the house. 

The Yankees were playing the Giants in a few hours and I had five bucks riding on the Giants to win. I figured that night I would go into town and get myself something to eat for my stay there. Maybe pick up a six pack and listen to the game on the radio before bed so I can get some rest before cleaning the place in the morning.

I cooked burgers on the grill outside when I returned and halfway through the second inning I started in with the beer.

After drinking four of the beers I got up from the chair and walked over to the sink to place the bottles. I’ve drunkenly tripped over them before and have since learned my lesson. By this point I was in the sweet spot of being drunk but still sober enough not to do anything stupid like drive. I know my limit and that makes the rest of the night that much more confusing. One moment I’m at the sink and the next thing I know it's morning and I was standing on the beach staring out at the lake without any idea of how I got there. 

For a long time I felt the same feeling I had after waking up at a hotel and not remembering where I was. Only this is far worse because the soles of my feet are being pierced with jagged rocks and the wind carried just enough lake water to make me wet. No matter where I stood there was a new rock that cut my feet, forcing me to move slowly as I tried to find the best course of action to take to get me back to the house, wherever it was. I looked around my unfamiliar surroundings hoping to see the house but I didn’t. I panicked and wondered how far I walked and if this was even the same lake. It is at this moment that I realize that I am only wearing my boxers and shirt and I hope that no one sees me. Thankfully it is early in the morning and I doubt many people would be looking outside of the window at the lake at this time.

I have never been on this beach before so I don’t know if I am walking the right way to get home. I really hope I am because my feet hurt, more than anything though I want to change into something dry after taking the hottest shower I can bare.

After what seemed like forever I saw the house. I nearly smiled at the sight but its then that I start to worry that there was something medically wrong with me. I am too afraid to go to a doctor. What if they tell me something that I don’t want to know, like I have a brain tumor or that I am going crazy like my uncle?

Was I sleepwalking? I don’t have a history of sleepwalking but that doesn't mean it didn’t just start all of a sudden.

After I shower and change I sat on the bed to think about what I was doing out there that morning. Why wouldn’t I have woken up on the way out there? One would’ve guessed that I would have woken up as I stepped on the sharp rocks. How didn’t that wake me up while I was going out there? 

While in the shower I inspected the soles of my feet and tried to clean the wounds the best I could. I was planning on going into town for cleaning supplies today so while there I added bandaids and hydrogen peroxide to the list of things to get.  Without the proper items around. 

While in town I came across a woman who hailed me down as I was filling up my cart.

“You just moved into Mr Bakers beach house, didn’t you?” the strange woman asked. She is older than myself and her hair is silver but she has a warm smile and seems nice.

“I did,” I said, returning the smile. “Peter. Peter Baker” I add remembering my manners and extending my hand.

“Lucile Pennyworth” the woman responded as she shook my hand. “I am so glad that Gray Hill has finally gotten some new blood in it,” she added.

“Did you know my uncle?” I asked her.

She shook her head, her face suddenly serious. “No, no I did not” she answers. “He was a very private man. And very quiet too” she added thoughtfully.

“I see”.

“I live across the lake from you” Lucile told me, her smile back in full bloom. “The green house with the deck. I live there with my husband”.

“Oh” I said, remembering passing it this morning. “Your house is beautiful” I added, hoping she didn’t see me earlier.

“Thank you dear” Lucile said proudly. “You should come over sometime. We can make you something to eat”.

“Oh, that would be great” I say before looking down at her cart which only has oatmeal and broth in it.

After parting ways I leave to pay for my things and go back to the house. Before I go in the house I sit in my car, thinking about this morning and how weird it was. Perhaps I should call a doctor and get checked out because I have never slept walked before in my life. I don’t make that call though because I am afraid of what they might say. 

While I doubt that it's because I have something like a tumor I would prefer not to be put in an insane asylum and under the watchful eye of orderlies. This morning was the closest I’ve gotten to an ice bath and I don’t want to repeat it. 

The more I think about how stress affects people the more it makes sense, the stress of a new house that landed in my lap, the moving in, the smell of fish that I cannot identify the source of and the mess my uncle left behind. I was satisfied with this answer and decided to leave it at that.

Inside looked worse than when I left it, mouse droppings are in the cabinets and there is a thick layer of dirt everywhere I look. The sooner I clean the sooner I can make a profit when I sell it. I went to the bathroom and placed my feet over the tub to use the hydrogen peroxide which immediately hurts like hell and I see bubbles form, proving to me that it is doing its job. Almost as fast as the pain arose it was gone and a moment later I dry my feet.

After drying my feet and applying bandages I cleaned the house for an hour, starting with the stacks of newspapers. Most of them were local, it was called Whisper Alley Echos, an interesting name to say the least. After this morning I wasnt a fan of it.

I don’t look through them, they all go right in the fire pit. In hindsight I should have read everything I could have gotten my hands on.

Next are the books, mostly about native American myths and wildlife but I see some other books that are dog eared, these books are by authors that I don’t recognize: Robert E. Howard and August Derleth to name a few.

I think that these books might be worth something until I see that my uncle has written in the margins of each one of them and even circled entire sentences on most of the pages. I decided that I might just as well toss these too because the library would not accept them due to their condition. 

When I was not burning the books and newspapers I was cleaning the house. I was so busy that by supper I nearly forgot all about that morning. After eating the rest of the food I purchased curiosity came over me and I started to read one of the books that my uncle had in his collection. It was a book about Native American folklore.

I must have fallen asleep while reading it because the next thing I knew I was dreaming of the sound of wind. It was cold and wet and I could see dark water churning from something stirring below. 

As soon as I wake up the wind from the dream is gone and it is silent. I am cold, wet and again I find myself outside on the beach staring at the lake. This time though my toes are in the water as its waves lap at my ankles.

About a hundred yards down the beach I see Lucile Pennyworth in the same position I found myself in. She was wearing a nightie and standing near the water's edge like I was yesterday. She doesn’t seem to notice me and I watch her walk gingerly back to her house due to the rocks.

After I made my way back to the lake house I struggled with the decision to go over to Luciles house to ask her what she remembered but decided against it because I hardly know her and don’t want to embarrass her by mentioning it. I wouldn't know where to start without making myself sound crazy. Perhaps I was afraid to hear what she had to say as well, after all it happened to me twice since I came here. 

The more I thought about it the less appealing talking to her sounded. Who knows how that conversation could end? Maybe with a call to Goose Creek Sanitarium? I would call them if someone told me the story I was going through and I had better things to do than getting my head cut open and parts of my brain scooped out by shaky handed doctors with opium addictions because they can fill out their own prescriptions.

I skipped breakfast that morning and spent that morning wondering what to do. I debated on leaving but at the time I felt a pull to this place. Like I had unfinished work that needed to be done. For lunch I made myself a turkey and Swiss sandwich with all the fixings and as I put away the lettuce and mustard the phone rang.

“Hello?” I answered, putting the receiver to my ear.

“Hello” the voice on the other end said jubilantly. “This is Lucile, your neighbor”.

“Of course,” I responded. “What can I do for you?”

“My husband Al and I were wondering if you would like to come over this week for dinner? Say, Thursday at seven?” 

I have too much to do here so I let her down easy. “I don’t know, I am spinning lots of plates right now” I answer truthfully while omitting the things that may make me sound off my rocker.

“I bet you are, '' Lucile says. “Your uncle's estate and all that”.

“Yeah” I answer.

“One would think that someone would have complained and wanted the house for themselves, wouldn’t you?” Lucile wonders out loud.

“I don’t know” I say as I look around the house. “We weren’t close”.

“Strange” Lucile says, her gears turning. “How are you liking Gray Hill?”

“I find it very agreeable. The fresh air is nice” I answer.

“That's good to hear, Mister Baker. You let us know if you want to come over for dinner anytime. I will make quail”. Lucile says excitedly. “Toodle-loo”.

“One second” I say just before the receiver clicks. I didn’t know what I was going to say and hadn't thought this far ahead. I stumble for a bit before finally saying something coherent. “What can you tell me about this lake?”

“It's called Dead Horse Lake” Lucile answered after a moment. “I can’t tell you more than that though” she says apologetically.

“Do you know anything about the town?” I ask. “The history or anything else?”

Lucile doesn’t say anything for a few long moments and I start to feel as though I somehow offended her. Before I can ask if she is still there though she says “I’ve lived here for the last forty years, but that doesnt make me an expert” she added with a chuckle that sounded fake.

“Have you---” I start before pausing to weigh the words I am about to ask. “Did you see me the last two mornings?” I ask.

“No, why?” she answers, a little concern comes through in her voice.

“I don’t have a history of sleepwalking but since I moved out here I woke up standing next to the lake two days in a row” I say with a laugh that sounded forced to me so there is no doubt in my mind that she heard it too.

“I don’t know what to tell you” she answered after a moment. “I have to go though. Bye”. I heard the receiver click, leaving me looking at the phone in my hand wondering why she wouldn’t just admit to me that she did the same thing this morning? 

Then again I wouldn’t have if someone said that to me.

Throughout the day I found myself looking at the lake for long periods of time, wondering why I find myself drawn to it even though I am increasingly disgusted by it. On any other day I would have said the lake was serene and beautiful. Now though, the sight of children swimming on the other side of the water splashing and having fun is upsetting so much that I have to leave the house. 

During my walk I wander into town, it's a short walk and under any other circumstance I would be glad for it, today though I fear it only exacerbated my fears and doubts. 

In town I stop by the store to buy more food for the day since I don’t trust this refrigerator and the fact that it stunk from molding food my uncle left behind I figured that it would be a better idea to buy one day of food at a time. 

At the store I bought fish that was on sale but back at home however I cannot bring myself to eat it when the thought that it was caught in this lake crosses my mind. With that thought I decided to throw it away and go hungry instead.

I don’t turn on the radio that day because baseball seems meaningless, instead I fill the rest of the day reading what remains of my uncles notes hoping that I might find a clue why this is going on. Instead I only find mad ranting I cannot make sense of. 

That night before bed I do something that I have not done since I was a boy and I pray. I have not been a good christian, I’ve not been faithful, I drink, I gamble and I cheat on my taxes. I doubt that God would listen to me, a thought that plagues me as I beg God that I wake up in my bed, safe, warm and dry.

In my dreams I hear a deep and growling voice say “Come to me” from the darkness swirling above and below me. When it repeats itself a second time it is even rougher and more demanding.

I wake up with a sharp inhale, more scared than I have ever been in my entire life. This time I am not standing with my toes in the lake, this time I am thigh deep in the water. My entire body is cold and damp as if I had been swimming while wearing my clothes. 

I turn around to make a retreat back home before anyone can see me and that is when I see Lucile standing just a few feet behind me, the water lapping at her toes. Horrified, she looks at me and she whimpers “What is going on?” hoping that I have an answer for her but I don’t.

I imagine that my face is a mask of confusion and terror just like hers even with my attempt to put on a brave face to make her feel better.

“I don’t know” I answer, my voice wavering.

“How long has this been happening to you?” 

“Three days” I say as I step out of the water. “Each day I get closer to the water”.

“You were in the water” Lucile points out.

“First day I wasn't in it, yesterday my foot was in it. I think youre a day behind me” I say and immediately regret it.

Why did I say that? All I did was terrify her.

“What does that mean?” she asked. Instead of answering her question, movement in the corner of my eye captures my attention. I turn to look at it and I see a boy no more than eight years old further up the beach. He is wearing his pajamas and is barefoot as he runs away. Lucile tracks where I am looking and when he sees the boy she says “That’s the Carter’s boy”.

“Why is this happening to us?” I ask, tears now flowing freely down my cheeks but I manage to keep my terror from my voice.

“Are you going to stay here? In town” Lucile asks as she shakes her head and hugs herself to keep warm.

I can't explain the pull I am feeling towards the lake. It's a strange thing. Wanting something that you know is bad for you. Instead of trying to explain this I change the subject. “Why don’t you leave?”

“I have a whole life here,” she explained.

We stand there in silence for a long time, during which I wonder why I am defending myself staying here. I am new here and no one would miss me if I pack my bags and go. If I stay, what happens tomorrow morning? If the pattern continues I’ll be swimming in the water when I wake up.

“I have to do something before I can leave” I say abruptly as soon as she starts to ask me something. From the look on her face I correctly predicted her question and answered it preemptively.

Lucile nods with tears swelling up in her eyes before she walks away to her home. She does not say a single word and turns her back from me and walks away. I feel as though my response robbed her of hope.

I’m almost as far away from the house as I can get but the walk doesnt hurt like the other times since I am thinking of other things. When I look behind me I see bloody footprints being lapped up by the waves of the lake. The sight of that was somehow more unsettling than it should have been, yet when I try to explain why I can’t. 

At any point that day I could have packed the few possessions I brought with me and left but for some reason that I cannot explain I stay. I keep telling myself it was out of curiosity or that it was because I don’t like to leave things unfinished but now that the incident is behind me I think I can safely say that there was something else at play. Something that I cannot put to name. 

Something like a will much stronger than my own.

I decided to dedicate the rest of my time at the house to pour through my uncle's writings. I tried this the other day but I am more determined than ever to find out what I can about Dead Horse Lake.

I just pray I didn’t already burn the answers I need in the fire pit. 

Most of the time my departed uncle's handwriting was unreadable but I managed to ascertain the gist of it thanks to the few words that were legible. This was rarely helpful and most of the time dealt with things unrelated to the lake.

I always heard that my recently deceased uncle was touched in the head but now I wonder if he was sane this entire time. In his writings there were phrases that I do not dare give breath to. The only thing I will say about them is that the more I hunted for answers the more confident I was that he knew what was happening or had a good idea anyways. 

The answer I seeked was somewhere here, I could feel it, yet for all the hours I searched I could not discover what it was. 

Constantly I thought about the books and newspapers filled with his scribblings being burned in the fire pit and each time the thought of the answers being burned up rekindled my resolve, making me search harder.

I started to write down my own notes on any piece of paper that I could find but the only paper available to me was the outer pages of the local newspaper, Whisper Alley Echos. To an outside observer I would look as crazy as my uncle but at the time I didn’t care about how it might look. This was too important to keep up appearances, at least that was what I kept telling myself. If this was true I would have called Lucile to see if she would like to help me search for answers but each time I started dialing on the rotary phone I hung up just before the last number could be dialed in. 

I could not tell you with certainty what time I started reading but I can tell you that when I was finished the sun was reduced to a sliver and the night was settling in quickly. Sleep was close at hand but I dared not shut my eyes out of fear of waking up in a similar fashion as the previous few days so I decided to brew some coffee.

All the reading I was doing wasn't doing any favors and only exacerbated how tired I was. Fearing that I may not be able to wake myself up in time if I were to close my eyes again I went outside to get some fresh air and hopefully wake up a little. As I sipped on the coffee I sat next to the fire pit and looked off to the lake.

Across from my house I could see people building a large bonfire. From this distance I guessed the wood that was gathered was hip high and was made into a large U shape about fifty feet long and bending away from the lake. The figures who walked around the wood dosed it with flammable liquid before they lit it on fire. As the fire rose they started dancing in an almost tribal or feral manner to the rhythm of the drums that the night carried over the water.

I tried my best to stay awake. However the more I fought it the more tired I became and soon I was asleep again.

“Come to me” said the echoing voice from before in an odd combination of anger and patience. “Come to me” it said again with more force.

In the dream there was a tangible void and in the inky blackness I saw a shape of something that was offensive to the eyes reach out to me with a great and terrible maw. Before it touched me I woke up and found myself in darkness and unable to breath. My body knew what to do before I did and instinctively I started kicking and paddling in what I hoped was towards the surface. My lungs were on fire the moment I woke up and since then I have swallowed what felt like a gallon of water. As terrifying as drowning was, it would not be half as bad as discovering that what I saw in my dream was real. Imagining that shape coming towards me from below gave me an added incentive to swim faster than before. I felt as though whatever it was I saw in my dream was on my heels the entire time. If I could have screamed underwater I would have. 

With each kick the precious little oxygen I had was being used up and just when I felt as though I couldn’t go on any more I saw a light above me.

After what felt like hours the light became brighter and the water warmer and I realized this was the surface of the lake. This reinvigorates my fight for survival and I push past the point of what I thought was possible as I did everything in my power to ignore the burning in my chest or the black spots that are starting to cover up my vision. 

When my head broke the surface I gasped air greedily as I cried.

As I treaded water in the middle of the lake I looked for the closest beach since I was too tired to swim much more. That is when I spotted Lucile on the edge of the water, thankfully she noticed me and was running to the end of someone's dock to throw me a rope. 

If she had not done this I don’t think I would have made it to shore.

She pulled me in and somehow managed to lift me onto the dock. She asked what I was doing in the lake but I was unable to answer because I was so out of breath, besides the look on her face suggested that she already knew the answer to that question.

When I was able to speak Lucile was wailing with her hands covering her face, asking me if she would be the next one in the lake. I couldn’t get a word in because I was so tired but even if I could have spoken there wasn’t enough time to because she hysterically started to ask if she would be under the water tomorrow morning.

In her groveling she showed no concern for my own well being and only thought of herself so I made no more effort to comfort her in even the smallest capacity. I was angry as much as I was scared and left to return home, leaving her wailing behind me and begging for answers for which I had none to offer her.

I regret leaving her like that. She was nothing but kind to me as soon as I met her. Looking back at it I don’t think I was angry with her. Not really. I was just scared.

As I made my way around the beach I noticed that I was getting close to where the large bonfire was last night on the opposite side of the lake. I could see the smoking remains of last night's fire on the beach reaching for the sky with white tendrils.

The house that lay behind the burning remains had seven people watching me from a porch held up on stilts high above me. They were silent and motionless, the only movement they made was when their white clothes were blowing in the wind. They were all wearing white, the men in trousers and button up shirts while the woman wore white dresses and sun hats. Initially my instinct was to wave to them but something told me that would not be a good idea, so I walked faster to get away and did not chance a look back for fear that they may still be there, watching me as I departed.

That was the last day I spent in Gray Hill. I got my things and left as soon as I got home and promised myself that I would never return. 

Maybe nearly dying lifted the force preventing me from leaving? Maybe whatever it was that wanted me to stay already took what it wanted? Either way I was glad that I no longer felt the need to stay.

The rest of the morning was spent driving back to the city, far away from Dead Horse Lake. Safe and away from all that happened to me over the last few days I did all I could to drown my fears and sorrows. Anything to convince myself that my experiences were only a vivid dream.

I called Lucile and her husband the following week but was told that Lucile went missing the day after I left and the Carter kid the day after that. No one knew where either of them went. Everyone but me that is. I know that the lake wanted them like it did with me.

I do not know what the reason was for having me wake up by or under the lake and do not wish to find out.

I think I will be asking for a fraction of the suggested price just so I can get rid of this house.

I’ve (23M) been putting off going for a psych eval even though I know that seeing  things isn’t normal.  I wasn’t sure if I wanted to put this on [r/offmychest](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/) or into [r/advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/advice/), so I’m just going to drop it here since this sub seems like a combination of both.

I  know this post is already ramble-y but getting into everything is  really difficult for me because admitting to seeing the things I’ve seen  is not easy, and I don’t want to admit that my mind might be slipping.   I guess I’ll just get it over with for now.

It  all started a couple weeks ago, on a camping trip in the mountains.  I  used to go every few weeks, but the last time I’d been there was an  accident involving several schoolchildren who had wandered off the path  and ended up at the bottom of the mountain.  I’m not really  superstitious, but I had witnessed what happened and going back there  was a daunting prospect, especially since I was the only witness and  therefore considered a suspect.  Either way, I booked a weekend off to  try to cause some kind of exposure therapy I guess.

Walking  up the path that I’d taken before was fine.  I didn’t feel any  different, and I wasn’t seeing things.  Yet.  After a good four hours or  so of hiking I found a clearing to set up camp in.  I re-hydrated some  food, replied to some messages, all of the usual camping things.  I’d  planned to hike for an extra few hours the following day to make up for  letting myself get out of shape, so I turned in early for the night.

This is when shit gets weird and I know I should seek help but I just want to know if others have experienced this.

I  woke up just as the moon was almost fully ascended.  That’s normal for  me, kind of.  But then I started to hear things.  Whispering.  Like  little kids whispering.  Obviously it’s normal to hear animals and shit  at night but now that I think about it, there weren’t any animal sounds  that I remember.  Just whispering.

I  laid there for a few minutes, trying to figure out if I’d left my radio  on or something and it was malfunctioning.  Eventually, I got up and  opened the tent to see- nothing.  The whispers stopped.  I decided that  my mind was being overactive and left it at that.  Closed the tent, got  ready to get back into my sleeping bag and get ready for the next day.   As soon as I put one foot in the sleeping bag, I heard a childlike  giggle.  Creepy.

I opened the tent  and immediately the silence resumed.  I stood there, all kinds of  thoughts racing through my head while my heart went nuts.  That’s when I  saw them.  Five little sets of eyes by the trees, all at varying  heights off of the ground.  I shut the tent and tried to sleep while the  whispering continued.

The entire  next day I felt like I was being followed, and I’ve felt like that  since.  I see shadows out of the corner of my eye.  I hear giggling,  whispering, like those kids are playing some sick little game with me.  I  feel like I’m going crazy and nothing has helped, not even holy water  or any of that shit.

So yeah I’m  kind of looking for advice?  Or asking if anyone else has experienced  this, I guess.  Have you ever been haunted by children you’ve killed?   It never happened to me before.

Edit:  Answering some questions.  Yes, I’ve booked in with a psychotherapist,  no I’m not answering questions about the kids or where it happened  because I’m already a suspect.  Yes it really happened, this is not a  troll post.  I camp alone because I enjoy solitude.  I’m closing the  comments thread now.

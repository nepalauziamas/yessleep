As the title states, I started my career as an EMT some years ago. I love my job. It's gross some days, funny other days, and tragic on several days, but I wouldn't trade it for the world. There are, though, some days that have stuck with me. Not because of the trauma, or the grief, or anything like that; don't get me wrong, I have several of those days, but those stories are for another time. These are the days that got downright creepy. Days that I remember because I can't really explain what happened. The days that keep me awake if I think too hard about them, trying to wrap my mind around events I can't really understand. 

My therapist actually suggested writing my stories down, and talking about them, so I figured why not kill two birds with one stone and share some of them here? At the very least, it may help me sleep, despite this subs name. 

We'll just do these one at a time, then, if you kind readers will have me.

This is the story of the time a patient followed me home. Names and locations have changed obviously because I don't want to be eaten by the HIPAA monster.

It was an average day, and by average I mean balls-to-the-wall busy. If you've ever worked EMS in an overworked, understaffed system, you'll know what I mean. Dropping off patients at the hospital with 15+ calls pending and no trucks available, shoving cold spaghetti down your throat because you're too busy to eat, that kinda day. We had just dropped off our *illionth nursing home patient (lovely woman, broken hip, had a lot of good stories) when the call came out: Cardiac Arrest, high priority response. 

I work for the county agency, so we're a little all over with our calls. The CAD notes stated that this was a house way at the end of the county, so far in fact that a fire department from a neighboring county was first responding, because they were closer. 

It was a rural area, heavily wooded, affectionately known as "Methlehem" to most of us. Meth heads, trailers with huge expanses of land for miles, old low country people that don't wanna be bothered, that kind of stuff. We run a lot of calls in that area despite its sparse population. Mostly overdoses and psych calls, but today it would appear that someone's premium life subscription had expired. The CAD notes read as follows:

17:31:05 CALLER STATES FOUND HIS COUSIN UNRESPONSIVE IN FLOOR, STATES SHE IS NOT BREATHING****

17:31:09 CPR IN PROGRESS, COACHED BY DISPATCH

17:31:12 CALLER STATES TO USE FRONT ENTRANCE NEXT TO DRIVEWAY DRIVEWAY HAS BLUE FORD PICKUP PARKED****

17:31:17 CALLER STATES PT DOES NOT HAVE A PULSE

So, off we go. We make the long drive down the old, winding back roads and arrive on scene. The house is just an absolute mess. Trash all over the yard, dogs barking loudly from the fence, the oh-so-recognizeable smell of piss and mold coming from the open front door. Fire is already walking outside from the house, shaking their heads. My partner and I walk in, expecting the worst and pretty much find it. Surrounded by what I assume was her family, on the filthy carpet of what I assume was the living room floor, was the body of the cousin, pale and in full rigor mortis. For those who don't know, which I assume is few if you're on this sub, rigor mortis is a state in which the body somewhat "freezes" in place, usually several hours after death, due to naturally occurring chemical processes in the body. This, unfortunately, means the patient is *far* beyond saving, and no amount of CPR would change that. 

Protocol states that in these situations, we take the family aside, and calmly but directly let them know that their family member is deceased. Being the softer crew member between my salty paramedic partner and myself, I automatically elect to do this. I pull who I assume to be the caller aside, and attempt to tell him that there's nothing we can do. 

He doesn't like this. 

Family members getting angry with us during times of tragedy is common. I've been in multiple situations where grieving family members need an outlet, and the nice EMT man looks *just enough* like a punching bag. 

This dude pulls a gun. 

So I'm standing there, looking at the gun, and I look at him, and he says, cold as ice, "You're gonna fucking step over there, and you're gonna fucking fix her. Do you understand?"

I nod my head, silently pressing the emergency button on my radio to get Law Enforcement on the way.

"Yeah man, there's always a chance. Let me do what I can."

I subtly make eye contact with the firefighters outside, who immediately also contact law enforcement after following my eyes to the gun. I proceed to do what the man says, because what else do you do, ya know? So, I look at my partner, nod, and we begin to do CPR on this corpse.

And her eyes just fucking...shoot open. 

Like, we're doing CPR, admittedly half-assed Hollywood style so this poor lady's cousin doesn't make the incoming coroner even busier with two more bodies. And this lady is dead. I mean, D-E-D, dead. Double dead. We don't withhold CPR if there's even a snowballs chance you might still be kicking, and this lady was just gone. We're through our second round when I hear the sirens. I look away, look back to my "patient" and her eyes are just wide open.

They were closed before. Her mouth was open, and her eyes were closed. Now her mouth was closed tightly, and her eyes were wide open, bloodshot and staring straight at the ceiling above her. Her pupils, of course, were fixed and dilated. It was eerie. I've seen lots of dead folks before, but this just shook me for some reason. I stumbled. The guy behind us shakes his pistol, sobbing, and demands to know why I stopped. So, I continued.

To make a long part of the story short, Law arrived, got the dude to put his gun down, and arrested him. We, of course, discontinued CPR and I had convinced myself that it has been a figment of my imagination, that her face was like that when we started. We'd packed up our gear and were preparing to give the coroner a report, when we walked past the guy who had pulled the gun, in handcuffs, sitting next to a police car. He looked up at me, and typing out what he said next still gives me chills.

"She ain't gone you know."

I looked at him curiously, and asked him to repeat himself. "I'm sorry sir, what was that?" The rest of the man's family looked on in silence from the porch.

"I said she ain't gone," the man continued. "She ain't ever been gone and ain't ever gonna be gone, and you quit working on her. She ain't here because of you. But she ain't gone. She's with you now."

I started at the man, taking more pity on him than anything, as he continued.

"Shes gonna follow you. I done talked to her. She's following your sorry ass home and she's gonna watch you and make sure you never forget that you stopped workin on her. She gonna follow you. She following you now you sorry son-of-a-bitch. She's following you now. She's following you now! She's following you now!"

The man starts yelling and the responding officer comes over to throw him into the back of the car.

The man just grinned as the back door of the patrol car shut. Something about it was sinister. Sinister on a level I've rarely seen, and I'll admit, although it was just the unstable ramblings of a man grieving the loss of a family member, it gave me chills. I looked back at the man's family, and they were all just...staring at me, as if this was somehow my fault. 

We eventually cleared the scene. I felt an eerie sense of doom following us, but I honestly just credited that to the multiple disturbing factors of the call, from the state of the house to the dead patient and her charming family members.

The rest of the day went by with few remarkable incidents. A few more granny falls at the nursing homes, a kid with what was essentially a bad paper cut, you get the idea. I couldn't shake that call from earlier, and the look on that man's face as he said what he said. I especially couldn't forget the patient's eyes. Her wide open, dead, bloodshot eyes. They still haunt me.

I got off late that night, which had become annoyingly typical at that time.  I was getting ready for bed. I had fed the cat, and was getting ready for a hot shower. The steam built up and I stepped in, enjoying the scorching hot and just sorta coming down from the day. I grabbed my shampoo, lathered up, and went to rinse. The soap blurred my vision, and that, to this day, is the story I stick with.

As I go to rinse the shampoo off, my eyes are kinda doing that thing where you squint them closed to keep shampoo from running in them? You know the thing. I can see my feet, and when I look slightly forward, my heart jumps into my chest. In front of my feet appears to be *another* pair of feet, blueish in color. I practically leap out of the shower, wildly throwing my fists out in front of me and simultaneously trying to clear my vision. When I get the soap out enough, I see...nothing. Nothing, of course, except my now torn down shower curtain, very wet floor and my extremely confused cat looking at me with more judgement than a cat has business casting.

Long day, I say, and I just proceed to dry myself off and call it an evening. Ghosts aren't real. The feet weren't real. None of that was real, I tell myself. It's what you do, realistically, when confronted with stuff like that. We always yell at the person in the movies, say stuff like "Yes! It was real! You just saw that, run!" 

Except when it's just you, and you're all alone, your brain will try to rationalize away stuff like that. You'll tell yourself the clich√©s; talk aloud to yourself about how it was just your mind playing tricks on you. So I go to bed.

I always sleep with a box fan, right next to my bed. Box fans keep me from silence, which I absolutely can't stand to sleep in. Sometimes it makes funky sounds and I just ignore it, because a few clicks or dings here and there is better than trying to sleep with no background noise.

That night it had been *particularly* noisy. It just kept clicking, over and over again. *Click-click, click-click, click-click.*

Eventually, exhausted, at this point it was nearly midnight, I rolled over to turn the fan to a different setting. I hoped that jostling it would maybe make the sound stop. 

When I roll over, I am face to face with someone. Someone is crouched down at my bedside, staring at me. It was mostly dark, and I didn't get too many details; frazzled, long hair, pale skin, and most importantly, in whatever dim light was in the room, I could make out wide, bloodshot eyes, just staring me down. It's mouth was wide open, and the clicking sound was coming from *it.*

*Click-click, click-click.*

I jump from the bed, slamming my light switch up. Of course, it had disappeared as soon as the lights were on. I ran to the living room and then I just kinda stood there?

I mean, I had to process what I had just witnessed. No signs of anyone in my house. Doors were still locked, cat sleeping lazily on the couch, nothing out of the ordinary. 

I called a buddy of mine on nightshift for the company. I knew I wasn't going to sleep that night, and I had the next day off anyway. We played Xbox until the early morning, and eventually I passed out around 10 am.

Nothing ever happened after that, and it's been years. No odd occurrences at home, no more creepy shower feet. Thankfully, for the rest of these stories, the creepy happens at the scene, or at the station, and not my own home. But I will always have the image of those eyes, wide open and inches from my face. And even if it was a trauma response or a hallucination or whatever, I can't un-hear that creepy clicking sound she made, and I jolt awake any time my box fan sounds anything like it. 

Thank you all for reading. This is the first time I've told this story, and it'll admittedly be the first time I've told *many* of the stories I plan to tell in the future. Hope you all have a great night, and a word of advice: If you ever have to jump out of a shower, plan your landing spot ahead of time and do it *safely.* I almost slipped and fell.

Until next time, stay safe out there.

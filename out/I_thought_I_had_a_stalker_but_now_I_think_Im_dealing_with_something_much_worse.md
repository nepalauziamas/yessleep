I’m writing this to let someone know what happens to me if I vanish without a trace. I can feel them watching me, waiting for when the moment is just right.  I will try to fill you in on as much as I can before I’m gone. 

Let me start by saying that men stalking me is not new to me. In eighth grade there were two upperclassmen who would follow me home from the bus stop. I would have to race home and throw open the door before quickly locking it behind me. Some days they managed to nearly get a foot through, but thankfully our doors are heavy so I could crush them enough for a retreat. When they failed to get in they would circle around my house like sharks, taunting me until my parents came home an hour later. At one point they managed to get my phone number and they’d call me and tell me private things, like the color underwear I put on right after a shower. It freaked me out well enough but no one could do anything. Eventually my parents had someone, whether it be themselves or my cousin or someone else, always escort me to and from the bus stop. That drastically reduced the boys’ harassment. When I stopped riding the bus in ninth grade it stopped completely. 

Then in tenth grade something similar started happening. I was talking to this guy online and he began begging me for my address so he could send me love letters, I refused because he just someone I knew through mutuals. One night, after one late theatre rehearsal, I went to hop in my car to drive the four minutes to my house. I took sometime to reply to a text before backing out. When I looked up from my phone I saw a car parked next to me, I hadn’t noticed it before and just thought it was a parent picking up their kid. I start my car and pull out of the school parking lot, the car follows me with no headlights on. I thought it strange since no one got in so I drove around my neighborhood trying to lose them. I thought I took enough turns when I no longer saw them behind me. I was wrong. I pulled into my driveway, got out the car and saw them parked at the foot of my driveway watching me.  

Everyday that following week I would wake and all of my car doors would be open, windows down, etc. One day was pouring rain and it soaked the interior of my car. There was nothing of value taken, everything just moved around. I began locking my doors at night, something I should have already been doing admittedly. After that week things died down again. 

However for the next few years whenever  I forgot to lock my car, personal item would go missing from it. Things like a diary, a seashell, a birthday card, anything significant to me. I was a server and any loose tips would never get touched during these break ins. Sometimes my music in my CD player would start when I had it on radio the night before. Every now and then I would pull up and see someone in my bushes, lying in wait. Gone before I could see who. 

During COVID all my family stayed home all the time and the activity stopped once again. I’ve gone almost three years without incident.  Up until 3 weeks ago that is. I ran into one of the boys from the bus stop at a shop in town. He recognized me before I did him. 

My personal items have started going missing again. I thought it was Gabe, the boy previously mentioned. A velvet hair bow I wear all the time was in my consul now gone. A rose a friend gave me. Pages from my school journal. The usual. So you can see why I thought it was just my stalker. Until tonight. 

Tonight I was home alone. I was cleaning, something I’ve been putting off. While I was cleaning, I kept hearing faint tappings, like someone attempting to look through the windows. Then I started louder thuds and shuffling. I waited, thinking it was my family returning from their excursion. When I didn’t hear their voice I went to investigate. My cat seemed jumpy so I unlock the front door and circle around to the back to see who’s there. That was my plan at least. Before I could, black humanoid figures whizz past me. Two of them. They weren’t humans, the lights shone directly on them. It was like a human shaped cutout in my surroundings. Like I was nearly seeing something I shouldn’t be able to see. Then I noticed how eerily quiet it was. No sounds from the cicadas or creek that runs along my house. I make my way to the back door, seeing the figures dancing behind the corners of my eyes. I scare myself by triggering the motion light. Something the figures didn’t do even though one of them ran right by it before I approached. 

I dart inside a lock the doors. My mother returns eventually and asks why all the lights are on. I explain to her what happens and she turns white, saying she’s been hearing strange noises this week. Spooked, we brush it off as imagination and say goodnight. 

But as I was watching TikTok tonight a video popped up, talking about Fae. That’s when it hit me. Last night while sitting in my car I saw thousands of fireflies in my backyard. I joked about how it looked like Fairyland and left a little trinket for them, not truly believing in there existence. But I think those figures may have been Fae using glamour. I think my offering may have accidentally got me into something. It’s almost Midsummer. That’s one part of the year when their magic is strongest. They had been stealing the things from my locked car. I know it was locked. My offering was an invitation. In a few days, when they are strong enough they are going to take me to their realm. I feel it. It will be like I disappeared into thin air. I can’t sleep now. Especially not when I can see their glowing yellow eyes peering into my bedroom window  from the darkness. Watching. Waiting.

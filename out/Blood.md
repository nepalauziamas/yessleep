“For eons, the world was dominated by the wicked and the puny cowers as their sight aligned, like scorching heat on their neck and million needles piercing every pore on their body as it petrified them.” I narrated as my boy laid on my trembling torso. “What happens next, papa?” with a teeny unsettling voice that reverbed through numerous ancient walls, I answered “When people discovered that their weakness was the blood of their own, blood of young demons, we started to fight back. The war between Hell and mortals still has a long way of ceasing, but they says that–” I felt something wet dripping from my shoulder, and my boy was already asleep. I pulled away from his snuggle and tucked him on his bed. I was careful not to disturb the chains, since it was heavy and used for security, as I was sneaking from him. Damn, carrying a gas lamp is scary; you can feel the gas waving with the fire still on.  I was halfway to the exit when a rogue nail cut my forearm. Blood was rushing down my arm to my fingertips. That was the time I heard that sound that chills me down to the bone.


I heard things tumbling down from the corridors I’ve been to. And as I heard thunderous sounds of metal breaking, I knew those were the gigantic chains holding it, I ran immediately. I can feel my soul rushing out of my body, because I know, I know the only creature that is able to do that, a demon. I was running, my lungs and innards were having a hard time to keep up, letting my instincts tell me where to take a turn. “Crap, where am I?” I thought to myself. My family has been here for countless generations and this was the first time I got lost in these halls. I was terrified. That was the time I regretted skipping leg days, I had to stop, my whole body was exhausted. Out of all the places to catch my breath, a deadend, “Is this my fate?”. The silence that resonated through the halls was the most horrifying sound I have heard my entire life. A few minutes later I can hear tiny footsteps approaching me. I started to cry my eyeballs out and I cannot prevent my terrified whimper from making too much noise. The sound of walking evolved into sprinting, every gallop it took the louder it became. I knew who he was but as soon as its glowing eyes exposed its face I realized that I was not scared of it but what would happen next. There are only two ways this would end, either I bring it to the void or embrace my fate. It was out of control, it did not know what to do, it was only following its own instincts; it spread darkness. Faster than a blink of an eye, it was crouching on my shoulder, grappling with my hair, and its arms piercing my chest like a skewered barbeque. I am more than able to defeat this little demon, but I cannot kill my own son.

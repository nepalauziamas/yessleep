I’ve eaten the high school food served in the cafeteria before, whether it be because I forgot my own or I was dared to by a friend. It’s mediocre and most definitely overpriced, so I bring in a homemade lunch instead.

But I can’t do that every once in a while. Premade lunches are prohibited by the school board on the 17th of each month. It’s almost like those ‘pizza’ or ‘pasta’ days some school cafeterias set up, where they only serve a certain food that one day. Except we HAVE to eat the food given to us.

The food they serve to us is different from normal days, specifically the cheese in the hamburgers, hotdogs, and pasta. The normal cheese is an obnoxious, bright shade of orange that will harden if you leave it out too long. The other cheese is white and runny, and it tastes like medicine.

Maybe they do put medicine in the food. Or maybe some sort of poison? It’s a heated topic to parents. They argue with the school board about it each year. Some even try to sue, claiming their kids are getting sick because of it. They never win though; the board hires phenomenal lawyers. 

I don’t think anybody’s ever gotten genuinely ill from the food, though. But it does have this one side effect. 

For a couple of days after each 17th my brain kind of just… turns on. I can’t get myself to think about things that aren’t school related. I get so alert all of a sudden, sometimes I can’t even sleep.

It’s got to be from the weird cheese they give us. I’ve asked other people in my school about it. They all have the same symptoms as me. 

But why? Why would my school be poisoning its students? If someone were to find out about it with solid evidence, their reputation would crash. And trust me, the school board would NOT want that to happen.

Unfortunately, I don’t have any real evidence to prove my theory. All I have is gut feelings and instincts. Those have to count for something. 

Because why would the board be so insistent on its students eating their food on the 17th only? They even went as far as to produce vegan options for students who couldn’t eat the cafeteria food served. 

And once, when the 17th fell on a weekend, the board attempted to send lunches to each student’s home and force them to eat it. Nobody was eating what they got sent though, and complaints were through the roof. That policy only lasted a couple of days. 

It’d be almost impossible to skip lunch. Everyone gets cooped up into the three school cafeterias and basically locked in there until staff is sure they’ve eaten. No excuses. 
    
The 17th is coming up soon and I want to find out what is really happening. There’s a big football event on the 14th of Friday. Everyone will be there. With the help of a friend, I want to break into the secretary’s office during the game and look through her computer. 
    
I’ve seen her leave it running whilst going to do other things. Surely I can find out what we’re actually being served there.
    
Or am I just insane? I’m risking severe punishments and a bad reputation to attempt to solve my conspiracy. Is it really worth it? Surely somebody here can tell me the right thing to do.

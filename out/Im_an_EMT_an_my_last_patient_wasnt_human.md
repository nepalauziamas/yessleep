It was a dark, cold and foggy night, there wasn't many action, so my coworker and I were sitting in the ambulance waiting for a call, our shift was almost over. He looked at me  and with a tired voice he said
-We're almost done with this, lets hope we don't have any calls, it's been kinda quiet...
-Oh my god you really said the q word
-what quiet? C'mon that so called 'curse' isn't true you actually belive in that? 

Suddenly the radio turned on and started to tell us all we needed to know to get to the victim, they said we were responding to a heart attack, that the victim called and collapsed right after telling its address.
-Isn't tue is it? 
-This is just a coincidence don't believe in those things c'mon... 
We sped through the empty streets, the only noise that we could hear was our engine and the sirens...... 
We came to a stop in front of the victims house, we came in through the unlocked front door and right on front of us was our caller, I quickly checked his pulse but, its was, fast, really fast, I open his eyes and I notice that they weren't responding to light correctly but their color, it changed from a light blue to a dark brown in a span of a few seconds. I didn't know what to do, I checked behind me to see if my coworker was still behind me, but I couldn't belive what I saw, he was impaled by large woden sticks, one to through the mouth and another through the chest. I quickly call out for him but I obviously get no answer, I hear a noise coming from behind so I turn arround and I see, nothing, literally nothing, it was like staring directly into the vacuum of space, I turn back once again looking for the exit but there was nothing there either, where did everything go? 
From the distance I see two eyes staring at me, but when I looked at them I felt weird it was like those eyes told me, that, what I was looking at didn't have a soul, they suddenly changed colors, again from a light blue to a dark colour that i couldn't see from here, so I called out for it
-Hello? 
-Is there someone, or something there? 

No response, suddenly the eyes reaper, but white, and they were getting closer, I couldn't move scream for help, so I accepted my faith, but suddenly I felt something grab my arm and yank me out of the house, I look at the man, and his face seemed familiar, but I couldn't recognize who it was, I look at the door and see my co-worker's feet being dragged back into the house leaving a trail of blood on the white porch, the man that saved me gets on his knees and tells me about what that was, I didn't pay attention to him, i simply replied
-It killed him
The man with a calm but manly voice says
- Yeah and you would be dead too if it wasn't for me 
The man puts on a hat and walks away, he was kinda weird I decide to leave but as I look at the window and I see my coworker alive and without a single scratch, I sped to the station and quit on the spot, im now studying to be a nurse, but, my 'coworker', appeared in class today and sat next to me, I dont know how much time I have left before that thing, finally finishes the job, that's why I'm writing this, it shape shifts, don't trust anyone, or anything....

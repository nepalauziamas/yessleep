I'm not really sure how to start this. I guess first I should link Jake's [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/djy97b/i_kept_noticing_extra_animals_at_the_pet_store_i/) if you want to get the full context on it. To make a long story short, he encountered some kind of shapeshifter in the pet store he worked at. It consumed or slaughtered a large amount of the animals there. I didn't find out about this until I read his post and until I saw the tape he decided not to give to the police.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Where do I fit into all this? Up until about half a year before Jake made his post, he and I were best friends. We had been since second grade. Have you ever met someone and just clicked with them? The kind of person who'll listen to you vent about your shitty day at school or work sometimes for hours on end. That's how he and I were.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

If I needed a place to stay I knew I could always stay with him and his parents. They're good people. Of course, I would've gladly done the same for him. It's just that generally speaking he tended to keep his problems to himself. Most times he was content to simply listen and only contribute to the conversation every so often.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He was the same way with Kelly up until their abrupt breakup which I played a major role in causing. To this day it's my biggest regret. See, she was someone I had a serious crush on ever since I first saw her walk into Mr. Harrison's class in ninth grade. Unfortunately for me, she made it clear a romance between me and her wasn't going to happen. Jake on the other hand was a different story.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

She was attracted to him. He wasn't someone who'd try to constantly hook up with his girls. As a matter of fact, he told me that he wasn't sure what she saw in him. If I had to guess, maybe it was that he was a good listener. Plus, he could be quite funny at times.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

At graduation, she confessed her love for him. They got together and stayed that way for over six years. Things weren't perfect. What relationship is? However, I came to find out that Kelly had some I don't want to say issues.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That sounds a little harsh. I'll leave it at, she deals with problems of her own. I didn't find out about it until Jake told me four years into their relationship. I was surprised since as I said he's not usually that talkative. That one time, though he was more open.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Whenever pressure really piled up it led to Kelly being hard to deal with. He tried to but sometimes all he could do was step away to let her off steam. Not to say she didn't make an effort to keep her emotions in check. She really tries to.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

One day he invited me over to their place to hang out. Nothing seemed wrong at the time other than Kelly having an unusually stressful work week. Even then, whenever I was over there that week, I never sensed much tension. There must've been because she came home from her last shift fuming. It didn't take a genius to tell she was upset.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Her watery eyes and sniffling made that obvious. Jake instantly tried comforting her. They went into the other room to talk and I thought the situation was deescalating. Then out of nowhere, I heard her shrieking and a loud smacking noise.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Jake, wait."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I saw him storm through the living room and out of the front door with a handprint on his face. I was stunned. I knew things got heated sometimes but nothing like this. I didn't know what to say as tense silence coated the air. Finally, I turned to her and asked one thing.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Why?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"I don't know," she stammered. "I wasn't thinking straight. It's like my body just did it on its own. I wish he'd let me talk to him about it."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"If the situation were reversed, would you?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

She said nothing.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"I should get going."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I got up to put my shoes back on.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Wait," she called, making me pause.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"What?" I replied, trying not to sound irritated.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Don't go. I don't think I can handle being by myself right now."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Then you should've thought of that."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"I'm serious. Please. I just need someone to talk to and I trust you as much Jake."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Part of me wanted to leave her right then and there. I would have if the other part wasn't worried about what she might do if left by herself. The latter feeling won out. I should mention at this point my attraction to her had lessened. Don't get me wrong, she is pretty.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It's just that over the years I came to see her as more of a friend. She and Jake made a great couple and I wanted to respect that. On that night, though, things went wrong. She vented to me and I listened, trying to give decent input.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Do you want some beer?" She offered.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I seriously wish I declined. I'm not usually a drinker. However, with tension so high something to make me relax didn't sound like a bad idea at the time. We ended up having one too many drinks. Somewhere in the conversation, one thing led to another.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

If I were to be asked who came onto who I wouldn't be able to tell you. All we knew was that when we finally came out of it, we realized that we were both naked on the couch. Shame was one of two emotions I felt at that moment and it was plain on Kelly’s face. The other was fear. We hoped that we could get dressed before he got home and then never speak of the matter again.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I know how shitty that sounds but the thought of him finding out made my stomach churn. Not that it mattered, though. Jake unlocked and came through the front door as I was getting on one pants leg. We felt like deer in headlights. One glance at us and his eyes filled with fatigue became full of rage. I

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In all the years I knew him, he was always very level-headed. He could only take so much, though, and seeing us was the final straw. Jake isn’t someone I ever associated with fighting or getting violent for that matter. However, he went from zero to ten in mere seconds. I didn’t get a chance to speak before receiving a hard punch across the jaw.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It dazed me and I fell back as Kelly screamed. I tried to keep him off of me but he kept wailing on me. Even when I tried to retaliate, it was as though he was so angry, that no pain registered to him. It got so bad that he began drawing blood with each punch. I’m really lucky I didn’t need any dental work afterward. Soon, all I could do was lie bleeding on the floor while moaning in pain.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He then turned his attention to Kelly. I was terrified he was going to attack her as well. Thankfully, he hadn’t gone that far off the deep end. Instead, he flung some of my blood on her. She jumped when he did, shrieking loudly. Jake then pointed first to me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I’m done with you,” he said and pointed next at Kelly. “And I’m especially fucking done with you.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He practically spat those last words. Upon exiting the house, he slammed the front door so hard a nearby picture fell from the wall, shattering to the floor. We were left in silence. Kelly was shaking and my head throbbed with pain. I passed out from it shortly later. When I came to, I was being put on a stretcher.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I glanced around and noticed a cop car parked near the driveway. I guess someone called them having heard all the commotion. Two visited me in this hospital and told me Kelly explained things to them. One gave me a dirty look which I couldn’t hold against him. They mentioned that I did technically have some grounds to press assault charges against Jake.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My response was to tell them I didn’t wish to and simply wanted to be left alone. While in the hospital, I received some stitches prior to the cops showing up. I didn’t hear anything about Jake getting arrested so I guess Kelly chose not to press charges either. I wanted to at least apologize to Jake but unsurprisingly I found that he blocked my number and my social media accounts. I messaged Kelly and found out she’d been given the same treatment.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That was the last time I would talk to her for months. Through the grapevine, I heard the breakup took a severe toll on her mentally. She ended up spiraling into a depression which caused her to lose her job and have to move back in with her parents. I’d say I was only doing slightly better by comparison. Although I was able to hold down my job, what happened made me lose sleep over many nights.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Some of my co-workers even commented that I looked like a zombie. They didn’t know about what happened and I strongly wanted to keep it that way. I dealt with the stress for about eight months before it became too much for me. I needed to at least try and talk to Jake. I figured the best way to do that was to go to his parents since I didn’t know where his new place was.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It took a lot of time for me to work up the courage to go over there. They were always so nice to me and I couldn’t imagine what they must’ve thought of me now or Kelly for that matter. I walked up to their porch, took a deep breath, and rang the doorbell. His mom was the one who answered and to my shock, she’d been crying. Her eyes were red and puffy.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Neil, what are you doing here?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I’ve been wanting to talk with Jake. Is there any way you could pass along a message for me?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Get out.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“What?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I said get out.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

She got loud and his dad came to the door next and pulled his mom away, telling her to wait in the other room. What was even more shocking was that I saw his dad had been crying as well.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“What did you say?” He glared at me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I just told her I wanted a message to be passed along to Jake. I know I hurt him but I at least want to apologize.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He looked ready to punch me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“That can’t happen.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“What do you mean?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He struggled to get out these next words.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Jake is dead.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The words made me feel like I’d been thrown into an ice-filled pool.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“What did you say?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“He’s been….Murdered.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

His mom, having come back into the room, began sobbing.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Goddammit. See what you did?” His dad hissed at me. “ First that cheating bitch shows up and now you. Just get out of here. Go before I call the cops on your sorry ass.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He slammed the door in my face, leaving me in stunned silence. I couldn’t believe what I just heard. Jake couldn’t really be dead. Could he? For the first time in months, I got in touch with Kelly. She sounded awful.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Hello?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Kelly, I went to Jake’s parents’ house.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

She was silent for a moment before replying.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I don’t want to talk about this.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Kelly, please. I need to know what happened to him. Do you know anything at all?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

She sighed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I’ve looked into it some. I can send you what I’ve found.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Okay. Thank you.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Kelly ended the call and immediately after my phone pinged with a new message, containing a link. Opening it took me to a news site containing an article and video about Jake’s death. Apparently, he was in a motel room when it happened. The guests reported hearing several gunshots coming from his room. The police were called.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

What they found was so disturbing one of the officers sent out threw up on the spot. The name of the motel he stayed at was mentioned so I decided to start there. I took some time off from my job and got a flight over there. From the reviews I read, the motel’s quality was minimal at best. It was the kind of place someone only goes to either do drugs, fuck a prostitute, or if they are desperate.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I never knew Jake to be associated with the first two. That only left the third. I wondered what he could’ve been running from. The cops? Did he owe some people money? I intended to find out. The clerk was a greasy-looking middle-aged balding man.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He glanced up from the book he was reading, having heard the bell ring when I entered the building.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Room for the night?” He asked me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I told him I wanted to stay in the same room Jake did. Instantly his face dropped. His expression became panicked. His hands actually began shaking. Seeing this caused me to grow concerned.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Are you a reporter?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“What? No. Why?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I’d ask why you’d want to sleep in that godforsaken room then but to be honest, I don’t care. Either way, you aren’t sleeping in it. Now, if you still want to stay here, I have plenty of rooms available.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I want that one. I can even pay you extra to stay in it.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

At the mention of getting extra money, he became a lot more cooperative.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Alright. I don’t know what you’re expecting to find, though. Cops already searched every inch of that room.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Did you see anything?” I asked, swiping my card,

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He froze. The look in his eyes gave me cause for concern and made me apprehensive about what I might find. Still, I needed to press on.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I’m not talking about that. Here’s your key card.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I paused in front of the door. Seeing it was making me nervous. I pushed this feeling down and unlocked it. If I hadn’t known what took place in the room, it would’ve seemed no different than the others. However, since I did it made it have a more sinister quality to me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It was just your standard shitty motel room. An outdated TV stood on a nightstand in front of the bed. The walls were a sickly yellow and covered in various stains. I dropped my things onto the floor and sat down on the bed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Jake, you deserved better than dying in a dump like this,” I thought. “What was after you?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My mind raced with possible suspects. I couldn’t think of any. Jake was usually a pretty reserved guy and usually avoided or tried to de-escalate any conflict. Sure, he had his moments but only when he felt wronged in some way. The idea that someone could hate him enough to kill him seemed absurd to him.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Still, it was a fact. The mystery of which, I intended to solve. I knew the cops already thoroughly searched the room. However, if there was even one thing they overlooked, it might help. I spent hours combing through every inch of it. By the time I was done, I was exhausted.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I didn’t find anything. I flopped onto the bed, letting out a deep sigh. I felt like both a failure and an idiot. The former because I couldn’t bring closure to his death and an idiot for being in over my head. I mean, who was I?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Just some pencil-pushing office worker in over his head trying to tackle a task better left to experienced detectives. I rolled onto my side, facing away from the door. That was when something caught my eye. Part of the wall didn’t seem quite right. Most of it was smooth and yet one part seemed to be bulging out ever so slightly.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I wondered how I’d missed it but thought at first glance that it was nothing more than the result of a shitty paint job. Then I took a closer look at it. My heart skipped a beat when I realized it wasn’t part of the wall at all. Rather, it was something that’d been shoved in the gap between the wall and floor. Whatever it was, could’ve been obscured by shadow which would explain how the police missed it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Getting it loose was difficult. For one, I couldn’t get a good grip on it. For another, the dried paint acted as a sort of seal. I did have something to help, though. Within my luggage was a weapons case.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It contained both a gun and knife. I undid the lock and got the knife from it. Using it, I worked at the bulge. Eventually. It came loose enough for me to pull it all the way out. I glanced down at the object in my hand to find that it was a flash drive.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My mind raced with questions as to what could be on it. Did Jake leave this here? If so, why? There was only one way to find out the answers to those questions. I had brought my laptop with me to have something to do while winding down.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I powered it on and after it finished booting up, I put the flash drive into one of the ports. Opening it showed a number of video files. The first was titled “Journal” followed by a date. The others were titled the same except for being numbered.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I clicked on it. The video began with Jake adjusting the camera. He backed away from it, revealing a motel room. He sat down, taking a deep breath before speaking.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I’m not really sure how to begin this. I guess I’ll start with who I am. My name is Jake Scott and something is after me. I know how insane that sounds, but I swear it’s the truth. Actually, before I get into it, I should mention that I made a post about how I first came to learn of this thing. It’ll be on this drive to whoever wants to read it. Otherwise, I’ll just summarize it.”

I wondered what he meant by thing. He went on to explain the events in his post. I thought it was crazy and yet part of me wondered if it could possibly be true. From the article I read and news video I saw, it seemed to be the case. An interviewed cop said he’d never seen anything like it and looked incredibly shaken up.

“I left off in my last post that I was debating on whether or not to show the last camera’s footage to the police. Some people were saying I shouldn’t since I would become a suspect in what happened at my store. Others suggested I should use some religious items. I can tell you now they didn’t do a thing against it.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Jake explained that he acquired various things to use against it. He hung up religious items all around his house and he even got some holy water.

“It showed up at my work during a closing shift. I recognized it right away because it had my face. It just stood smiling at me under a street light. Seeing it on video was scary enough. Seeing in person is without a doubt the most frightening thing I have ever experienced but I thought I was prepared for it. The way it moved was so unnatural.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He described it as moving almost cartoonish. It was as though it was parodying the way people normally moved. I thought Jake had lost it in all honesty. I mean, how could I believe something so horrifying actually existed?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“It was fast too. It sprinted at me and I nearly lost my shit. It caught me and grabbed me by the arm before I could reach my car. I tried the holy water but it did nothing against it. Honestly, I thought I was a fucking goner then.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

At this point, the creature’s mouth opened wide. Jake said he saw layers of teeth and at the back of its mouth some kind of swirling black void. My concern grew further. It wasn’t that I thought it was real at that point. It was more that he thought it was.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I was freaking the fuck out acting purely on instinct and doing whatever I could to get away from that thing. I got lucky. It bit me, but I smashed the bottle the holy water was in against it. That didn’t hurt it but it did make it loosen its grip on me and I got in my car. Even though it managed to break my window, I was able to get away.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He inhaled and exhaled. Then what he showed next began to make me think there was more to his accounts. He held up his arm which showed what appeared to be several layers of human-shaped teeth marks in it. Seeing this made my heart rate slowly rise.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I’ve been on the run ever since. I don’t know why it’s so fixated on me. I guess it just can’t stand its prey escaping. At least that bite wasn’t infectious so I guess I can count myself lucky in that regard. Well, that’s really all the energy I have for now. I’m going to bed. Hopefully, I can make another one of these soon.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I wasn’t entirely ready to believe him just yet. There had to be a more plausible explanation for his injury. Right? I thought maybe he’d ended up on drugs somehow and perhaps he somehow did that to himself. I mean, from the bags under his eyes he could’ve certainly passed for an addict. This was disproven when I opened a particular video.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Jake mentioned it was the footage of his camera inside the pet store during that day. After viewing it, there’s no doubt in my mind that everything he talked about is true. Jesus, the teeth on that thing. I’ve never seen anything like it and it’s made me put a lot of things into question. How do you deal with something like that?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Jake couldn’t, but it has to die for what it did. I’m not sure where to start though with that. I’m open to suggestions and I could definitely use some. However, I’ll be doing some research in the meantime. I’m terrified beyond belief of this thing, but it needs to pay for what it did. Hopefully, I’ll be able to [put](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesFromRose/) it [down.](https://twitter.com/RoseBlack2222)

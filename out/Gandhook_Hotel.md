Thankfully, I was able to get out of the hotel,but I’m definitely not out of danger. If anything happens, I want people to know about The Gandhook hotel.

To start the story, I live in Moore, Oklahoma and life was getting stressful for me, so I decided to take a vacation for a little. I wanted to go to Austin, Texas so I started looking for hotels there. I stumbled across the Gandhook hotel. It was cheap, nice looking, and had a hot tub. So I was all in. It was about a 10 minute drive into the main town, but it was fine with me for the price.

A couple hours later, I arrived at the hotel. I walked up to the reception desk to get my room key. The lady was nice and told me I was on the 4th floor. I started towards the elevator, and was just about to close the doors when the receptionist looked….off

By off I mean she had a huge smile on her face, with her head tilted, and her eyes wide,staring at me. 

“Fucking weird” I mumbled. I figured she must have a mental disease or some shit. So I just shut the doors quickly.

I made it up to my room, and finally settled in. The bed was comfy, and the room was pretty spacious for a 1 person room.

At about 11:30 there was a knock on my door. 

“Who the fuck is at the door as almost midnight?” I thought. “Who is it?” I said.

“Housekeeping!” A male voice chirped. I opened the door to find a man with a cart next to him. I asked him what he was doing here so late, but as I was talking, something started dripping from his eyes.

Blood.

As the blood was dripping from his eyes, I said “Sir, are you ok?” But just them a wide smile spread across his face, just like the receptionist.

I slammed the door in his face and bolted it shut. “What the fuck was that?!” I thought. I picked up the phone in my room to call the main lobby.

“Hello?” I said. “Hello, this is the Gandhook hotel main lobby, how can I assist you?” A lady chirped.

“Your housekeeper just walked up to my room at almost midnight, and his eyes started fucking bleeding.”
 
A long silence followed.

“Hello?” I said again 

“Yes hello sir, I don’t think it’s a large concern, just go to sleep.”

I just hung up the phone.

“Fucking useless.” I mumbled.

I laid in my bed, trying to drive the image of the man out of my head. Eventually, I drifted off to sleep.

I woke up, and the alarm clock flashed 9:30 AM. I got myself together and decided to check out some more of the hotel.

I walked down a long hallway, and approached a large window. It overlooked another floor, and I noticed some people down there standing with their heads tilted.

“What the-“ Before I could even finish my sentence, they all whipped around to reveal large grins, and blood streaming down from their eyes.

“SHIT!” I yelled. I ran to the nearest staircase, and down to the lobby.

Then I saw the receptionist.

She stood at the desk, head tilted, with a huge grin. Except her eyes were gouged out and only blood leaking from them. The elevator dinged, and the doors opened to reveal more people just like her. With no hesitation, I bolted to my car, rammed my keys in, and hit the gas.

I’m at home now, and my doorbell just rang, gimme one second to ask who it is.

Ha, weird, that voice sounds so familiar.

Then I heard the words that chilled me to the bone.

“Open up, it’s housekeeping!”

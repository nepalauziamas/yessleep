Before I tell you my experience I just wanna say a few things. Before all of this happened I have been dealing with anxiety and maybe even depression, although I never went to a doctor to find out due to my fear. Recently my aunt died, she was very close to me so her death hit me hard. A few weeks before that my uncle died. 

It all started last week, I woke up and decided to go to the kitchen to make some breakfast. Upon walking there I saw my father, he's usually up before everyone else. "Being productive for once I see." He joked but I didn't laugh, I was too tired to. I turned the corner and I could've saw someone crouched at the corner of my kitchen near the stove, but when I blinked he went away. Okay, could be just me being tired. I got some cereal and retreated back to my room, that's where I stay at most of the time.

When I was finished eating it was about 1 o clock. I decided to play some video games. I leave my closet door open as well, that's was a problem today. One of my hangers began slightly swaying, gentle at first but then it became a lot harder and faster, like fast air was blowing on it. But there was no ventilation in my room that blows out air, my window wasn't open, so what was it? 

After playing some video games it was almost 4 or 5, crappy life yeah I know. I decided to do some Maladaptive daydreaming, you should really look it up to see what it is. After doing that for about 3 hours it was 8 o clock. I decided to be with my family for once so I exited my room and sat on the couch with my mother and sister. They all just stared at me with blank faces, for almost a whole minute. Afterward they began talking to eachother normally. What. The. Hell. I'm starting to think being confined to my room has taken a toll on me. This continued for days, the last straw was last night.

As I was settling in my sheets to sleep I cover my head with the blanket, that's what I normally do. Now my blanket is kinda thin so you can see the changes in shadows or you'll know if someone is standing infront of you, stuff like that. As I was about to close my eyes, It happened. I felt my bed sink, as if someone was putting both hands on my bed to prop themselves. And I could vaguely see the shadow of someone, inches from my face. Like they were waiting for me to pull the blanket back. I was so terrified I just laid there in shock. They wouldn't leave.

No matter how many minutes, how many hours, they wouldn't leave. I was so scared I ended up going to sleep. I was awoken by my mother, she told me I had stopped breathing in my sleep and needed to go to the hospital. There I found out I had sleep apnea, what is going on?

First off, my friends introduced me to discord back in 2019 when I was a senior in high school. And ever since then, it was my bread and butter. I used it to always communicate with my friends when we were playing minecraft or valorant. One day, out of the blue, I got sent, let's just say, a very interesting image over discord from a random person on a random discord server. I was very scared at first because I've never seen something like it ever on the internet. After a couple minutes of staring at the image, I became more curious and started to actually like what I was seeing. I thought it was wrong to view it, but I rationalized it because I wasn't hurting anyone by just viewing it. The person that sent me the image also sent me an invite to a server. And I was shocked when I joined. There were hundreds of images of "family photos" and there were only about 32 members in the server. I was somewhat horrified that this existed over discord but was also intrigued. One of the rules of the server was that you had to post at least one unique image of a "family photo" every week. I didn't have a camera myself or any content to make myself but I was able to go on the internet and found some obscure pictures and used those to stay in the discord.

Some of the family photos included pictures at a hot tub shirtless, swinging on a swing at the park tongue out, in a sandbox, the mcdonald's play place, and even one on the potty, and other intriguing "family photo" images. I found most of my content from more obscure search engines such as yandex and duckduckgo. I've became obsessed with seeing them and I wanted more. If my mom ever found out I was viewing this stuff my life would be over. Same with my friends, my friends would have no respect for me and would be digusted with me which is why I never tell anyone this stuff to begin with. And even worse, if the cops found out about the stuff I've been viewing, I would already be a dead man. I don't like being this honest, but I cannot lie, I do like the pictures that I view and have substituted it for the regular things I've been watching. But I still rationalize it to this day that I'm not hurting anyone by looking at this stuff. But apart of the me thinks that it is still wrong but I know that that part of the me is not right. 

I was really happy getting on my computer every day, I got to see new images of "family photos" in different positions and the subjects had different emotions every time. Sometimes they were sad of the situation which deep down was my favorite to look at but it was also somewhat wrong to look at. And again I rationalize it as I'm not the bad guy doing this stuff I'm just looking at it. And also some were also happy but it was probably before any action took place. And it's very unusual for a subject to be happy after action takes place.

So, the real horror begins a few months ago. Since I joined the discord in 2021, I've been looking at the images in it up until a few months ago. And a few months ago, something horrifying had happened. One day when I got back from college to my home. I heard a large knocking on the door. It was an amazon worker. I even remember the smell of my mom cooking home baked chocolate cookies (yum). When I got to my computer, I opened my grouped discord folder where I keep my "family photos" discord server in and I thought I just didn't see at first. I opened spotify and went back to look for it, but it wasn't fucking there. I made sure I didn't move it around anywhere else on discord and didn't find it. I thought maybe they changed their discord server profile again, but they didn't. I was getting very anxious again and moments later my friend from that discord server, let's call him Spotty, broke me the news. The discord server was banned by discord and most of the members were banned. I was starting to freak out because I had all my "family photos" stored in that server and my favorite ones from the other members were also in that server. I didn't know what to do and I literally panicked. I didn't think this was actually happening and didn't want to believe it was real. I didn't know where else to get my images. I was really pissed and smashed my mouse and broke the spinner on it. If I had known this would have happened I would have donated money to my church and other homeless people. And I was also just really sad that this had to happen to me. I'm not that bad of a person, I go to school help my mom with her chores and I help my friends with their homework, I don't deserve this.

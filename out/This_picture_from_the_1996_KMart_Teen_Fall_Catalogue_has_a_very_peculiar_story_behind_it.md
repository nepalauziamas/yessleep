This image is from the K-Mart Teen 1996 Fall Catalogue, and it actually has quite a peculiar story behind it.

As far as anyone can tell, this is the only existing image of Kaylee Huston, who vanished without a trace in the summer of that year, shortly after moving with her family to the city of Glendale, California, just outside of Los Angeles.

The Huston family had moved from Shawndale, Arizona, to California in May, to a house on Wesker Street.  The house, a classic craftsman, was the oldest in the entire neighborhood, originally part of a housing development in 1933.  It was smaller than the grand five bedroom McMansion they had owned in Shawndale, but far more beautiful.  Entire Huston family had been excited for the move.

Kaylee, nineteen, was the oldest of three sisters.  In Shawndale she had always been the focus of much praise for her good looks, with many people encouraging her to pursue a life in front of cameras, as a model, an actress or a newscaster.  But Kaylee, an introverted and nervous girl by nature, had always been camera shy, and up until her senior year of high school, resistant to the attention foisted upon her.

Kaylee was home-schooled, and spent the majority of her time alone.  This had all changed when Kaylee, encouraged by her sisters and her mother, auditioned for the local high school’s winter play.  Though she was not technically a student of Fairview Valley High, Kaylee won the role of Hermia in A Midsummer Night’s Dream, and was allowed to participate in the play.

The experience was transformative for Kaylee, who found that she loved to be on stage.  She began to ask her parents every day to move to Los Angeles, so she could pursue a career as an actress.

Though it seemed an unlikely dream, Kaylee’s change of attitude came at the perfect time for the family.  Her father, Jay Huston, was recently retired, and her mother, Diana, was between jobs.  Her two young sisters were both in the process of switching schools, and their family dog, Pepper, had recently been put down after she was attacked by a coyote or some other small predator in the woods.

Kaylee had been the one to find Pepper, injured and crusty with dried blood and drool, her collar missing.  Her throat had been pulled apart and one of her eyes torn out.  Kaylee had cried all the way to the vet, and the experience had rattled the Hustons badly.  Kaylee’s new ambitions towards California were a welcome change of pace, one that would guide the family to a new beginning, and the decision was made to go west.

The move itself had been frustrating; several boxes had been lost, and Jay Huston had begun his first morning in California in a two hour long phone argument with the moving company, switching lines to yell at men from the insurance company, and then back again to accuse the movers of everything from incompetence to outright criminal theft.  The women of the Huston family had brightened their day by unpacking, and exploring the new house.  It had come unfurnished, other than a single landline telephone in a hallway downstairs between the kitchen and the living room.

It was in fact on this phone, that first evening, that a single call had come through.  Kaylee had answered it, on instinct; though the Huston Family’s phone service had yet to be set up.  The call had been short, and when she hung up, Kaylee said it had been a wrong number, or some kind of prank.

Kaylee said that the connection had been bad, and choppy, and that she had only understood part of what the caller was saying.  Though Kaylee attempted to move on from the conversation, the call had clearly upset her, and her mother pressed for more information.  Kaylee said that the only thing she’d heard was a very soft, very quiet voice, possibly a man but gentle and near a whisper, repeating a phrase again and again.

When Kaylee’s mother later spoke to the police, she couldn’t remember the phrase word for word, but said it had been something like: “I’m reaching for you, I’m reaching for you with my little fingers.”

In the following weeks the Huston girls had registered for the local school districts, and Kaylee had gone out to meet with several commercial modelling agencies her mother had found in the yellow pages.  Most of them were the kind of one stop shops that were common in Los Angeles at the time; photography studios with an agency or management arm attached, working directly with brands and catalogs.  Kaylee did a single shoot with an agency called Torrie Michelle Model Factory; in it she wore new K-Mart Teen Apparel, with the common practice being to photograph several dozen models and then send their photos in large batches to the distributor for them to pick and choose.

Kaylee was thrilled by the shoot and felt emboldened, making fast friends with several other young models in the waiting room, making plans to visit a local mall, the Glendale Galleria, that evening.  Diana Huston, excited to see her daughter’s newfound outgoing attitude in action, allowed her daughter to go out unchaperoned, but ultimately, Kaylee’s anxiety got the better of her, and she stayed in, playing board games with her family.  It was at three AM that evening that the family was awoken by the sound of a dog barking from outside.

When Jay Huston went outside to check, he found a small red collar, torn apart and stained with blood, left on the front porch under one of the lawn chairs.

This sparked a debate within the family; the parents believed that the collar must have been dropped and discarded during the move, and its discovery now was a coincidence.  Kaylee’s two sisters, both young, speculated that it could have been a coincidence, but Kaylee herself was certain that this was Pepper’s collar, the same collar that had been missing when when she’d found Pepper, staggering torn apart onto the front lawn several months ago.  Things became more complicated when Kaylee, in an effort to prove her point, attempted to locate a picture of Pepper.

It was rapidly discovered that one of the boxes that had gone missing in the move was the one containing all of the Huston Family’s framed family photographs, and another containing all of their photo albums.  This meant, in short, that there was no picture of Pepper to be found; no evidence of the dog ever having existed within the family, at all. Pepper had in effect, vanished without a trace, leaving behind only an illustration by one of the younger girls in her journal.

This re-invigorated Jay Huston’s anger at the movers and the insurance company, and the mystery of the barking dog and the torn red collar was slowly forgotten as the family struggled to get back to sleep.  Over the next two weeks, Kaylee repeatedly tried to bring up the collar, but Diana Huston had thrown it in the garbage the morning it had appeared and the rest of the family, unsettled by the incident, was eager to move on from the experience.  A month passed, and the appearance of the collar was mostly forgotten.

On the morning of June 25th, Jay Huston contacted the Glendale Police Department to report that his wallet had been stolen.

That evening, while walking home a long awaited hang-out with her new, Los Angeles friends, Kaylee Huston disappeared and was never seen again.  She was last seen leaving a Burger King on Brand Avenue at 6:35 PM, headed back home to meet up with her younger sisters to see a movie.  There are reports of a girl matching Kaylee’s description walking quickly, looking upset and anxious, from several eye witnesses but none of them could confirm that it was her.

In fact, efforts to confirm these sightings were when, in the wake of Kaylee’s disappearance, things became truly confounding.  Glendale Police and the LAPD, as was common practice, asked for a photograph with which to identify Kaylee, only for the Hustons to, with some degree of consternation, realize that they could not supply even a single photograph of their daughter.

Homeschooled, Kaylee had no yearbook photographs.  The entirety of family pictures from vacations and holidays had been lost in the move.  And the single portrait that Jay Huston had kept with him at all times had gone missing the previous morning, inside his stolen wallet.

The Hustons, confused and upset, contacted Torrie Michelle Model Factory, asking after the photographs from Kaylee’s K-Mart shoot; they were informed, to their great distress, that the negatives and only existing copies of the photographs had been mailed to the K-Mart headquarters in Illinois two weeks prior, and since Kaylee had not taken a headshot, there were no photos on file.

The Hustons, at a loss, contacted Fairview Valley High, hoping to get a photograph of Kaylee from her performance in the class production of A Midsummer Night’s Dream.  Furthering their frustration, they learned that the single large photograph taken of the cast and displayed in the auditorium had been vandalized in a student break-in that March, half of the of the photograph, including the portion featuring Kaylee, having been torn off.  The culprit was never found.

The photographer herself, drama teacher Marcia Sims, had died of congestive heart-failure in April, and most of her possessions given away through Goodwill, so any attempt to find the original photo-negative would be near impossible.

Unable to supply a photograph, the Hustons were forced to wait for the publication of the K-Mart Teen Fall Catalogue that August; bureaucratic red tape prevented the police from subpoenaing the full shoot across state lines, and even when K-Mart themselves tried to internally track down the rest of the photographs, forty in total, they could not find them within the tens of thousands of photos submitted weekly for K-Mart marketing purposes from agencies all over the united states.

The Huston family copied the single image of their missing daughter from the catalogue, and, months after her disappearance, were finally able to put up missing photos, the single glossy catalogue image plastered all over telephone polls and bulletin boards in Los Angeles County.

Months passed.  Years passed.  And Kaylee was never seen again.  Slowly the posters stopped going up.  

After four years, the Huston family separated; Jay had become too angry, flying into rages, and had been involved in an obsessive litigation with the moving company, who he blamed for the disappearance of their daughter.  Diana moved with the girls back to Shawndale, and then in with her ailing mother in Florida.  Gina Huston, Kaylee’s youngest sister, died of an overdose in 2007.  Paula, the middle child, now takes care of Diana, who fell ill with Alzheimers in 2010.  Sometimes, late at night, Diana will mistake Paula for Kaylee, and can often be found in the front yard of their Tampa, Florida home, calling out for their dog, Pepper.

The forty original photographs of Kaylee have never been found.  In November of 2013, a break-in was reported at the home of Andrew Michelle, son of Torrie Michelle, and now the owner of the still operational Torrie Michelle Model Factory.  At first it appeared to be an intentional robbery, but the type of damage reported was more in line with a small animal, with something having torn apart dozens of old files in his storage unit.  Nothing was reported stolen.  To this day Andrew Michelle and the LAPD assume it was a racoon.

Now, with the liquidation and closing of K-Mart stores throughout the country, and the collapse of the brand, one can only assume that those photographs, and their negatives, will have to be moved out of storage, somewhere.  And it’s for this reason that I ask for your help now; they have to be out there, somewhere, the pictures, my pictures.  The one picture, the original, of the K-Mart Catalogue photograph.  You can help me find it

If you or anyone you know has information on how to locate the originals, or the rest of the K-Mart shoot, please contact me as soon as possible, as I am eager to find them.  stop keeping it from me i need it the photograph There are of course digtal copeis but those dont matter as much they arent realyou see

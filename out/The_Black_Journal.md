"Sir, you might want to see this."

Officer Clarke handed over a black journal to her fellow office, Officer Jackson. He looked at it for a few minutes before placing it in an evidence bag and putting it into his car. They had arrived to the scene about 2 hours ago and still couldn't figure out what had happened, they got a call from a neighbour that had heard screaming coming from the house but when the officers arrived, there was silence and a lot of blood. Whatever happened in that house, it wasn't natural. 

Officer Jackson spoke with his shaking voice.

"We will find the son of a bitch who did this, that you can count on."

"I hope so sir, who would want to kill priests anyway?"

"I don't know Clarke but I'm gonna take that journal to the station, you okay to wait for more officers?"

She nodded and they both walked outside in the cold rain. He ran to his police car, got in, waved and drove off. He soon arrived at the station but didn't get out of the car, instead he took the journal out of the bag and stared at it. Something felt off about the book, the leather felt off and even though the book was found amongst the carnage, it hadn't been touched. He opened it and began to read.

I don't know why mom got me this stupid thing for my birthday but she said it was special journal and that I had to write in it when I feel upset. I guess that can't hurt. No gift from dad this year... Just like last year and the year before, I guess he's got too busy to send his daughter a simple 'happy 18th birthday' card. I hate him so much. Anyway, mom's made me a cake so I am gonna go and pig out, see you soon.

Hello again, journal. Sorry I haven't used you in two days, school like to get the better of me. Not long until I finally finish and get to go to college but I don't know what I want to do. Anyway, I have another horrible day at school, the 'queen bee's' of the school were teasing me again for my style. Just because I don't like to show my cleavage and my ass like a slut doesn't mean I don't a good style, whatever they have probably slept with all the sports guys at this point. I want them to leave me alone, I want them to die. Sorry, I shouldn't have written that. I've got dinner now so I'll write again soon, bye.

They have closed the school for a while. I was using my locker when the bitches came up to me and started mocking me again but this time, they brought up my mother. No one speaks about her. NO ONE! So I told them to go fuck themselves and jump from the roof of the school but that is when something weird happened. Their eyes looked like they were in a trance and they walked off. I went to art class and everything was going great until the cops showed up and took everyone out of school. All they said 3 girls had died but once I got home, someone had leaked the pictures already and it was the 3 girls that picked on me. They were dead and I didn't know how to feel, I still don't know how I feel now. Mom needs my help with something, I'll be back later.

Well... I've just had a bombshell dropped on me. The man who I thought was my father ISN'T my father. My mom came clean about it because she said 'my real dad is coming to see me' or some crap like that. She lied to me for my whole life, how can I forgive her like that? Whatever, I didn't like that man since I was kid anyway, he was always an ass to my mom and me. And now that I think about it... I don't look like him, at all. He has brown hair, brown eyes and was about 6 foot. I have dark red hair, freckles, blue eyes and I'm 5'7. I look like mom though with the red hair and all. I guess I'm kinda glad that he isn't my dad, I'm gonna go say sorry, I shouldn't have shouted like that.

I met my dad... Something is off with him. He has black hair, blue eyes, about 6 foot and he had a smile that made my hairs go up everywhere on me. We spoke for a while, he is a millionaire with a massive business, he owns a massive mansion and much more. Then he asked about me and I told him the simple stuff but I felt like he was judging me with every single word but then I said something that peaked his interests. I told him what happened at school, something I didn't even tell my mom and... He smiled. A very creepy smile but he smiled none the less, after a while he left. He shook my hand but it was a very warm handshake, he's a weird man. Got to go, mine and mom's favourite show is on.

I got a gift from dad today, it was a silver case with a lock on it. Me and mom both tried to open it but it wouldn't budge, I started to get angry as I held the lock but then... Then it started to melt. The lock melted... In my hand and...it didn't hurt. I thought mom would have freaked out but she didn't, instead she cried and smiled. We opened the case and inside was 200,000 pounds! In cash! Mom has been in money trouble since she lost her job a while back so I gave her what she owed and I have no idea what to with this cash. Am I crazy or I getting powers of some kind?

Something woke me up last night, I'm not sure what but something did. I slowly walked down stairs to see if someone had broken in but once I was down there, I saw something that was confusing. A door that led down stairs to somewhere but we didn't have a door that led downstairs, did we? Anyway, I quietly walked down the stairs and saw... That. My mom was praying in front of a pentagram of some kind and around her were heads of some kind of animal and she was saying something in a language I couldn't understand. Then... He appeared. My dad. He held his hand out to my mom and she took it and I listened to them talk for a few minutes. He was saying how he had doubts about me but didn't anymore and how he wanted to test me before he took me home... My mom agreed to this but then asked if she could go with me but he said no and that her job was to be here. She then said 'Yes, my lord' then he vanished. I went back to my room as quietly as I could and sat on my bed, I couldn't sleep. The morning came and I had breakfast with mom, I wanted to ask... I really did but I couldn't because I don't want to get her in trouble with whoever my dad is. I'm really tired so I'm gonna go to bed and have a nap.

I confronted mom today, I couldn't hold it back anymore. I asked her who and what was going on, she didn't answer at first which made angry, sad? I don't know! I felt the anger burn inside me then before I knew it, knifes were pointed at her. I gasped and they dropped to the floor, I also dropped to the floor and cried. My mom held me and rocked me like she did when I was a child. She wanted to tell me, I could see it but she couldn't so I didn't ask again. After that, we cleaned ourselves up and she took me to my favourite art shop, we got some McDonald's too then we had ice cream. She told me she will always love me and I am the best daughter she could have asked for, her words sounded sad so I hugged her and told her I wouldn't leave her and I plan on keeping that promise. No matter what.

His test came... They burst through the door with crosses and other god stuff. I stood in front of my mom to protect her but they shouted at her to go to them because I'm evil or I have evil inside me... They started saying prayers in English and an other language and something was wrong with me. Once they started to speak, I began to bleed, feel weak at the knees and it felt like my very soul was being stripped from me. I begged them to stop and how much it hurt but they didn't, I fell to my knees but mom caught me. Then something happened that me rage... One of the men pushed my mother over and she hit her head on the door and blood started to come out. It's a bit fuzzy after that but all I remember is... Screaming and blood... Lots and lots of blood... I woke up and ran to mom, I cried and I held her. I don't know why I did this but I bit into my finger and let my blood go onto her wound. A few minutes later, she opened her eyes and hugged me. Then he appeared at the door, a devilish smile spread across his face and he told me it was time to go home... Me and mom stood up and I took a good long look at my father... I then realised who he was... What I was. I told him I wouldn't go unless my mom came with me, he sighed and aloud it. I hugged her and ran upstairs and wrote this... I have a new home to go to and now I have a family too...

Officer Jackson let out a shaky breath, he placed the journal down and wiped his forehead. He was sweating but why? This was simply a prank book that had been placed there after the crime, right? He looked at the book again and opened it, he saw something in the corner of the book. It looked like the initials of someone, someone called L.M. He began to get really hot now like a fire had been started in his car but there was no fire. He then looked into the rear view mirror and saw something. His eyes glowed red and a hand reached out, closing the journal and taking it. The thing spoke.

"I believe this belongs to my daughter, you know it's a sin to read someone's personal journal, right?"

Jackson remained silent but nodded.

"Humans are such fun creatures but I must warn you Jackson, you speak a single word of what you have read or seen tonight, I will hunt everyone you love and I will make sure they burn in hell, is that understood?"

He nodded frantically and the creature smiled.

"Good. Oh and Jackson? Wait for my message, I have something planned for you."

Then the creature was gone, the heat was gone and so was the journal. He had never been a man of God but now... He wonders if it was too late to be one...

*Ugh.* I hated answering those questions. I resentfully clicked “OK."

**What was the name of your childhood best friend?**

My hands hovered over the keyboard. Two people came to mind—Michael Dobrevsky and Drew Suresh. I hadn’t talked to them in years, but considered them best friends back then. I couldn’t remember which I’d entered when I made the account, so I started with Michael.

**Incorrect Answer.**

*This is why I hate these questions. Worse than a password.* I typed in Drew.

**Incorrect Answer.**

I tried first and last names. Nicknames. Last names only. Every time, the same message popped up: **Incorrect Answer.** I sat there, confused, staring at the screen. **Skip this question,** I clicked, finally.

But the next question had me even more confused.

**What was the name of your high school?**

*Franklin High,* I entered.

**Incorrect Answer.**

*What?* Frowning, I entered *Franklin High School. Franklin Township High School.* Every permutation of "Franklin" and "High School" I could think of. Anything that it could possibly be. But each time, those two words popped up, burning into my brain. **Incorrect Answer.**

**Skip this question,** I clicked, and the next question popped up.

**Do you remember now, David?**

I jolted back from the screen. *What the hell?* My heart pounded and I suddenly felt dizzy. Faint. I wiped at my face, feeling the walls closing in.

Then I blinked.

No. That’s not what it said. I misread it. I reread the sentence:  

**Did you receive a text just now, David?**

***We’re going to try to verify your account a different way. Enter the verification code we sent to (XXX)-XXX-1539...***

*Everything is fine.* I picked up my phone and began tapping at the screen—then jerked my fingers back. *What is that?* Something wet and dark coated the glass, sticking to my fingertips.

I wiped the phone off on my shirt, grimacing, and opened the text. Fingers shaking, I slowly entered the code into the site.

***Thank you, David. You’re all set!***

I stood up, stretched, and walked towards the kitchen. I needed a drink after all this. After rummaging in the pantry for a few minutes, I pulled out a bottle of Jim Beam and poured myself a shot.

As I tipped my head back to drain it, I saw the blood.

So much blood, pooling out from something unseen in the family room. My heart beat painfully in my chest as I crept forward.

A body. Face down.

His jean pocket was turned inside-out, and strewn across the carpet were his wallet, his keys. No phone. Trembling, I reached for the wallet and pulled out a driver’s license.

The first name jumped out at me.

**DAVID**

I reached into my own pocket and pulled out my wallet. But I already knew the truth, now. I wasn’t David.

I never was.

I glanced over at my laptop, and his phone, sitting next to it. The bank’s account homepage, filling the screen, showing thousands of dollars ready to be transferred.

I’d done this.

I remembered, now.

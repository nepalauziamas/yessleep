Hands full, I shove my suitcase against the door, afterwards my eyes scan the interior of the room, looking for something to use as a more effective doorstop, to my surprise there is nothing but a small plastic stool sitting next to the sink, I attempt to prop the door up with it, and almost instantly the door slams shut, with a disappointed look on my face, I sigh and re-prop up my suitcase, walking around my somewhat small room, placing my bag in different locations tailored to what the bag holds

"Damn" I mutter, Clutching my duffel bag, I walk to my new bed for the next 4 days, set it down and grab the last remaining bags off my luggage cart. After setting down my bag I place my hotel room key-card into my back pocket and take down the luggage cart. Going down the elevator from floor 5 to the ground floor, as I exited the elevator and walked to my left, The lobby was eerie. I would normally ignore this, but, There was nobody, not a soul in sight. "Weird" I murmured to myself as I put away the cart and returned to the elevator. A sign that reads "Out of order" on the elevator catches my eye, "That wasn't there before?" I think to myself as I click the "Call elevator" button. The lights in the hall flicker as the button does not react. “Not only is the elevator broken, but the electricity is subpar as well? So much for a 5 star hotel” I grumble as I walk over to the staircase

**Guess we'll take the stairs**

I head towards the staircase, in a somewhat rushed manner, this hotel was rated 5 stars, how come it's so creepy? The eeriness of the lobby continues to stalk me as i take my first steps onto the long staircase, instinctively I count my steps as I walk them, and once i reach the first landing of the 21 step staircase, I hear a giggle from a little girl, My heart rate immediately starts to speed up, I step back down 10 steps to be met with a shadow of what looks to be a tall man, i continue my journey downstairs as I see the head of a little girl attached to the body of a six foot man, adrenaline rushes through my veins as I see multiple peoples heads attached to this monstrosity of a man, and one of its many arms clutching a baseball bat. I turn almost instantaneously and it's almost as if I had no control over my legs, which are now speeding up these stairs. I speed up the flights, first floor, second floor, third floor, "Run, RUN FASTER GODDAMMIT!!" I think as I breathe in sharply, fourth floor, then, sixth floor. a look of horror washes over my face, I run back downstairs, fourth floor, then i run back up, "fifth floor?" I read to myself. "WHATEVER KIND OF SICK JOKE THIS IS!! IT ISN'T FUNNY! YOU LITTLE BRAT!!" I yell, my voice echoing throughout the stairs. beads of sweat fall into my eyes as I push open the door to the 5th floor and run back to my room, frantically swiping the key card onto the panel, endlessly being met with the same declined sound, I start to hyperventilate, and then it hits me, The thumping of my heart that I've been hearing in my head is not my heart, it was footsteps. A look of terror runs over my face as the key-card declines one last time, and the thumping of footsteps stop. I turn around and am met with a baseball bat to the head. as I breath my lasts breaths, I see my attacker walking away with my wallet, keys, phone, my eyelids grow heavy, as i close my eyes I sigh in the relief of the pain being gone, My head was hurting from when I got hit, But now it doesn't hurt, I'm okay now

**I opened my eyes to the true reality of my new world**

Nobody who comes to this hotel should be allowed to live these horrible, Disgusting life that they're forced to live, I am so happy here that i even carved a smile into my mouth so i can spread the joy, We love to play pranks on the people who come here, And when they don't cooperate, we convince them to see the world how we see it, We only see light, We are happy, We all love each other, We will never leave, We love it here.

 

While writing this , my hands are shaking and i can just hope that this reaches the right audience in time.

So , you hear a high pitch loud scream at 2-3pm ? Well most of the people who had the pleasure of experiencing this phenomenon called the police or tried to look out of the window to see what is going on. But if you like to live , I would suggest you to follow these rules.

1.If you hear the scream outside , dont look outside the window. If you do so , they will get you.

2.The scream should stop after about 10-20 seconds , if it doesnt then im sorry for you. The best thing you can do is to shoot yourself in the head.

3.If the scream sounds like the one of a woman close all the windows and doors in the room and lay down. If it sounds like the one of a man , hide immediately under your blanket and hold your breath.

4.No matter what you do dont look for other people like your parents in your house. They wont be there , but something else will.

5.If you see a man without a face standing in your room , quickly flash your flashlight at him.

6.If you hear a loud knock on one of your window or door JUST IGNORE IT . They are trying to come in.

7.If the scream turns into loud laughing , close your eyes and play dead. If you feel your door opening reefer to the second sentence in rule 2.

8.If you hear your phone getting messages dont look at them. It is another trick of them to see if there is someone alive in the house.

9.If you suddenly get an enormous urge of drinking something , take a knife and stab yourself in the arm and drink the blood. No matter what you do dont drink anything else than your blood.

10.Keep yourself awake at all cost , if you fall asleep hope that they wont see.

11.If you hear one of your loved ones asking you to come downstairs while knocking on your door , open the door and close your eyes while saying the words "Sure darling anything for you". After this close the door and go back to bed.

12.Listen carefully. If you feel completely cold . like freezing cold , take a gun and shoot yourself in the head. Dont question anything , Just do it.

13.If you fall asleep , there is only one way to survive. There are 3 possible dreams which can occur. In dream 1 you will be finding yourself falling. If you get this dream hope that there is someone to kill you , because if there isnt , you will have to fall there for eternity. Dream 2 is the hardest one to survive , you see yourself in the exact same situation as you are right now - only that you dont know that you are dreaming. This dream will go on as long as you will think that its real. After the sun raises in the dream and you still think you are awake - hope that there is someone to kill you or you will be spending the rest of eternity in that dream. Dream 3 is the one you will most likely survive. You will find yourself in one of your childhood memories. Your goal is to relive the memory without anyone realizing that you are you. When the memory end you wake up and the "game" continues. If you see a man with no face in the dream just ignore it and act normally. They put him there to test you.

The "game" ends when the sun starts to raise , then you officially made it and after that there is no need to worry anymore. After the sun raised you will see a note laying on the ground on which is written "-. --- - .... .. -. --. / .. ... / .-. . .- .-.. / -... . / .- .-- .- .-. . / ..-. .-. .. . -. -..".

Good luck surviving in this cruel world. I wish you all the best.

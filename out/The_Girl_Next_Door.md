**This is a fictional horror story, that I had wrote when I was small. This has mentions of murder and curse words.**

When I was around the age of twelve, I lived in Arkansas, in a small town. I had only two friends at the time, Jessica and Charlotte. Charlotte was the oldest, she was thirteen, while Jessica was the youngest, she was eleven. 

Still, to this day, this story haunts me. There was a kid in town, named Annie Walker. Annie was around twelve to thirteen, long brown hair, and brown eyes. Charlotte's house was on the left, while I was at the right. Annie's house was in the middle. 

One day, Me, Charlotte, and Jessica were playing in my backyard. We were playing tag, and it was getting boring. "Hey, we should invite that new girl, Annie!" I told them, and they were a bit skeptical. 

"We barely know the girl, Sophia." At first, Charlotte protested but afterwards, she finally gave in. 

As we got up, I saw my mom talking to Jessica's mom. Out of context, it was just normal suburban moms talking. But *with* context, it was really creepy. We got out of the backyard, and we were starting to go near Annie's area, but my mom stopped us.

"Jessica, Charlotte, Sophia. Do not go near the Walkers." My mom told all three of us. I was.. *confused*. The Walkers were normal people, they were.. good people.  "Why, Auntie?" Jessica asked my mom, who was trying to hold back tears. 

We had no clue on what was going on, Jessica's mom comforted my mom, and we were just standing there, clueless. Jessica, Charlotte, and I walked back to my house and went to my room. I could see Annie's room, and Charlotte's room. 

"What do you think? Do you think Auntie doesn't like the Walkers?" Jessica asked us, she always calls my mom Auntie. "I don't know, last time Mommy didn't invite the Walkers to my seventh birthday." I shrugged.

I was only twelve, I didn't know what was going on. "That's odd." Charlotte mumbled. It was. My mom was a really known person in our area, and she was friendly to almost everyone. So it feels kind of odd that my mom wouldn't like the Walkers. 

Charlotte was called home, and Jessica was still in my house. It was already 6:25 in the evening, and Jessica's mom was still talking with my mom. "Something feels off, Sophia." Jessica told me, as she sat at the couch. "What is it, Jess?" I asked.

She sighed. "One time, I saw Annie and her brother bring a dead skunk to their houses." Although, I didn't think much of it before, it scared me *hardcore*. 

Five minutes later, Jessica had to go because it was getting dark. My older brother, Lucas, looked at me after Jessica had left. "Did Mom not let you ask Annie out to play?" He asked me, and I nodded. "She wouldn't let me play with Tommy as well. She seems worried," He continued.

I laughed. "She isn't worried, she's just scared I'll play with Annie." But he wasn't having it. "Cut the crap, Sophia. Mom's worried because there's something floating around town."

I paused. "What.... what thing, Lucas?" I asked him, and he was as equally as shocked as I was. "Don't tell anyone that I said that, Sophia. *Not even Mom.*"

I kept my word. A week later, Jessica had to leave town to Arizona for... *some reason.* So it was only me and Charlotte. I told her what Lucas told me, and she was.. confused. "The only thing floating around town is the autumn leaves. Don't get what he's saying but alright."

A few years later, Charlotte and I moved out of the town. It was the spring of 2016 when I got a text from Charlotte in our friend group. The three of us still were in contact even six years later. 

'Uhh, heyy you guys. you remember annie walker when sophia was 12, jess was 11 and i was 13?' The message read. I replied. 'uh yeah, remember when my mom didn't want us to play with her?'

Jessica replied as well. 'yeah, i remember. i think she had brown hair & brown eyes?'

'yeah, you're right jess and sophia. well, did you guys see the news right now?'

I lived in California, Jessica lived in New Jersey, and Charlotte lived in Philadelphia. 'nope, but i'll watch it today. which station?'

'it doesn't rlly matter on which fucking station, soph. GMA or the today show, maybe there.' Charlotte typed.

Later that day, I turned on GMA. *There it was.. In my own eyes*. Annie and her brother was framed for murdering their parents. In 2011, Annie had murdered her nanny and they covered it up in their backyard. With a dead skunk. 

I instantly remembered what Jessica told me. She had saw Annie and her brother bring a dead skunk to their house. Annie and her brother were located in California, where I was at the time. They were caught, when their neighbor saw blood splatters on the windows. A full investigation went on, and there, they found two dead parents.

Now, I knew what my brother meant. The thing floating around town, was the news.. *The news that Annie murdered her nanny.* 

Today, I'm now 24. I still got chills when Annie's or the Walkers were mentioned. I live with Jessica and Charlotte in an apartment. I'm grateful that my mom had prevented me, Jess, and Charlotte to go ask Annie to play with us. Because if we did, *we could have been her next victims.*

Mitch locked the door. We could still hear the wolf-creature eating Wyatt in the other room. Ripping, tearing, chomping, munching. The occasional crunch of snapping bones.  Me and Kenny looked frantically around the bathroom. It was small and cramped; barely enough room for three people. A toilet, sink, shower. Nothing else. There were no windows, no way to escape. We were cornered in here.

Abruptly silence descended on the other side of the door. Mitch pressed his ear against the door, listening intently.

I started to say something to him - I don't remember what - but he shushed me and waved for silence.

He turned to us, scared. I had never seen Mitch looked scared in all the time I had known him. "It's coming this way," he whispered.

"Oh shit," I whispered.

I listened, and could faintly hear floorboards slowly creaking. The sound was approaching the bathroom door.

Suddenly something heavy thudded against the door from the other side, causing us all to jump. Kenny screamed.

The locked doorknob rattled as a hand - or a claw - turned it back and forth. Then there was a soft scratching sound; gentle, almost harmless. The sound your dog makes at the backdoor to signify that it's ready to come back in. Except this sound was coming from nearly six feet up; too high to be a dog.

The door shuddered as the thing on the other side suddenly banged against it, snarling and slobbering.

Mitch took out his 9mm and snapped the safety off. Calmly, he aimed at the door. When the beast hit it again, Mitch fired, emptying his entire magazine. The gunshots were deafening. Sixteen small, splintery holes appeared in the surface of the door.

After my ears stopped ringing, I listened, but heard nothing but our own terrified breathing. An eternity seemed to pass. I looked hopefully at Mitch, beginning to think it was over.

There came a monstrous, ungodly roar of rage from outside the bathroom, so loud it made the gunshots that came before seem like the popping of a kid's cap-gun in comparison. It slammed into the bathroom door with what felt like the force of a freight train. The entire cabin seemed to tremble from the impact. We recoiled in terror.

The creature slammed into the door again, full force, and a vertical crack appeared right down the middle. The third blow and the splintering door stoved in a little.

"FUCK," Mitch shouted, and threw himself against the door, bracing his body against it. He looked at me in wild-eyed desperation. *"Help me!"* he yelled.

I joined him, putting my own weight against the failing door to reinforce it. The monstrous wolf-thing hit it a fourth time, and my entire body seemed to vibrate with the concussion. I could feel the door give a little more. The creature's strength was unimaginable. I envisioned a pair of ants futilely attempting to hold up a crumbling dam against the immense weight of a flooded river threatening to burst through and engulf them (Kenny was no help at all; while this was going on he had curled up in the bathtub and was going batshit hysterical).

Another huge blow from the other side. One or two more and the door would give out.

I closed my eyes and clenched my teeth in anticipation, knowing I was about to die...but the next blow never came. I opened my eyes and looked at Mitch. He looked back. We listened.

Silence.

We waited, expecting some new tactic or trick...but the beast had stopped attacking the door.

Suddenly there was another sound, but from further away; outside, maybe. The distant sound of crashing metal and shattering glass.  Then nothing.

We waited for several more minutes to be safe, then Mitch motioned me back. He unlocked the half-demolished bathroom door and cracked it open an inch. He peered out, then nodded to me and opened it the rest of the way.

The hallway was empty. There was no sign of the wolf creature.

We stepped out of the bathroom, Kenny trailing behind us. We cautiously entered the main room, looking around for any sign of trouble, but the beast seemed to be gone. Wyatt's body...or rather, what was left of it (not much) was scattered across the bloody floor. The door to the cabin was standing wide open.

"I think it left," I said.

"What the fuck *was* that thing?" Kenny said in a shaky voice.

"I think we *all* know what it was," Mitch replied flatly. And he was right, but none of us could bring ourselves to utter the word we were all thinking.

"Well, let's get the fuck out of here before it comes back," I said.

We hurried outside and started in the direction of Mitch's car...but stopped in our tracks, staring.

"Shit," Mitch whispered.

The metallic crashing sound we'd heard from the bathroom had been the beast flipping Mitch's Challenger over on its roof. It lay with its shredded tires - they'd been slashed to ribbons - in the air, shattered glass scattered around it from the broken windows.

"Fuck that plan," Mitch muttered.

"Christ, it must be one strong motherfucker," Kenny commented.

"What the fuck do we do now?" I asked Mitch.

"We can't walk out of here on foot with that thing running around. We'd be sitting ducks."

"Maybe it'll leave us alone," Kenny suggested hopefully. "Maybe it won't come back."

As if to contradict him, at that moment there was another of those unearthly howls from somewhere off in the distance. It was still out there in the woods.

"Let's get back inside," Mitch said, and we followed him into the cabin.

Mitch slammed the door and looked around. "Ken, give me a hand here," he ordered. Together, they worked to stand the couch upright and moved it against the door as a barricade.

"What about the windows?" I asked.

"We can board them up," Kenny said.

"No," Mitch replied, shaking his head, "There isn't enough wood in the cabin to cover them all. Besides, the hammer and nails are in the shed outside."

"Sooner or later it's going to come back for us," I pointed out.

"We gotta call the cops," Kenny said, panicking.

Mitch shot him a look of disgust. "Are you fucking serious? Call the cops? And tell them *what* exactly? A girl we kidnapped and murdered turned into a man-eating monster?"

"What about the Russian?" I suggested.

"What the fuck do you expect him to do? He'd think we were fucked up on something or we'd gone nuts. No, we're on our own here." Mitch said.

"What can we do?" I asked him, feeling my own panic rising.

"We have to kill it when it comes back."

"How? Bullets just seemed to piss it off."

"What about silver bullets?" Kenny offered.

"That's just movie bullshit," Mitch said with a dismissive snort.

"You got a better idea?" I challenged him.

"None of us even know *how* to make a silver bullet!" he retorted.

I thought about it for a couple seconds. I came up with an idea. I looked at Mitch. "Are you packing hollow points?"

"No, just standard hardball. Why?"

"Shit," I muttered, dejected. "Same here. I was thinking we could melt down some silver and pour it into some hollow points."

"I've got hollow points!" Kenny spoke up. He took out his .357 and removed the bullets, holding them out for us to see.

"Okay, now the next question is: do any of us have any *silver*?" Mitch asked.

I shook my head instantly and looked expectantly at the other two.

"No," Kenny muttered, looking down at the floor.

Mitch just shrugged and smiled ruefully. "Well, it was a good idea, anyway."

"Wait!" I snapped, turning sharply to face Kenny. "What about your medal?"

A look of alarm crossed his face and he stepped back, protectively clutching the chain of the St. Christopher's medal tucked in the collar of his shirt. "No!" he wailed.

"Come on, Kenny! Hand it over!" I said.

"No way!"

"Goddamnit, our fuckin lives are on the line!"

"It's from my mom! She gave it to me before she died!"

Mitch had had enough of Kenny's bullshit. He took out his pistol and pressed it against Kenny's forehead. Kenny froze and all the color drained from his face.

"Hand over that fuckin medal or I'm going to arrange a little family reunion for you," he said in a low, calm, menacing tone.

Kenny could see he meant it. Reluctantly, he took out his St. Christopher's metal and removed the chain from his neck. He kissed it and muttered "I'm sorry, Mom," before holding it out to Mitch who snatched it away.

Mitch examined it. "Maybe enough for six," he guessed.

There was another roar from outside. It sounded closer.

"We don't have much time," Mitch said grimly. "We gotta hurry."

He stood the rounds from Kenny's revolver upright on the kitchen counter. "You two, look around, see if you can find a blowtorch or something!"

Me and Kenny rummaged through the drawers and cabinets. Finally, I found a small propane torch under the sink. Mitch placed Kenny's St. Christopher's medal in a small saucepan. He lit the nozzle of the torch with his Zippo and turned its flame upon the medal. We watched, our hearts racing, as slowly the medal softened, then melted into liquid silver. Mitch carefully poured a few drops into each of the hollow cavities in the tips of each .357 slug until they were full. We waited a few minutes for the silver to cool and harden, then Mitch reloaded Kenny's .357 with the silver-tipped bullets. 

We were ready.

"Okay," Mitch said, "now we wait."

 

I sat on my couch watching tv when my phone buzzed in my right pocket. Taking it out I answered it.

“Hey, Oliver,” I said 

“How’s it going, Mike?”  
“Good, you?”

“Yeah, pretty good. But I was wondering if you would want to go camping with me and Jimmy tomorrow.”

“Sure. So how long do you think we’d be gone for?”  
“I’d say three days.”

“Alright, I’ll come by tomorrow with my supplies packed,” I said, hanging up the phone and placing it back into my pocket. I got up and walked into my bedroom to pack my things. I packed food and water, as all of us had a system.

Jimmy would bring tools and knives, Oliver would bring medical supplies, lighters, compasses, and the tents, while I brought all the food and water for us. The system worked pretty well in making sure none of us forgot items. After zipping back up my backpack, I placed it by my bedroom door. I slept early to have enough energy for the trip. In the morning, I put on new clothes and put on my camping boots and hat. Before walking out of my bedroom, I took my backpack and made sure everything was there. After checking the supplies 

I grabbed my keys and got into my car. I drove down to Jimmy’s house as his truck had enough room for everything. Once I arrived, I saw them waiting by the truck. I pulled in and parked at the side of the truck. “You finally made it in that old thing,” Jimmy said, laughing. “Yep, I made it.” laughing with Jimmy and Oliver. 

Once out of the car, I grabbed my backpack and loaded it into the back of the truck. I got into the car and we drove off to the forest. The drive to the first was uneventful. But once we got to the forest, I felt an eerie feeling. The trees were massive, easily the biggest I’ve ever seen, and the leaves were thick that it made the sun barely able to shine through. After a while, Jimmy pulled over, and we all got out. We grabbed our backpacks and Oliver lead the way into the dark forest. 

While walking, Jimmy handed me my compass, and that’s when I looked down at it. The compass needle kept moving around. “We’re here!” Oliver said excitedly. We all threw our packs on the ground and started setting up camp. After we finished setting up, it was pitch black out. Jimmy turned on his flashlight, illuminating our backpacks. He knelt down and handed us our flashlights. 

We all turned ours on, and we started the campfire. Before going to bed, we cooked some soup. It was the next morning. When I got out of my tent, I noticed that there was barely any sunlight because of the trees. The eerie feeling washed over me again. It felt like I was being watched from every direction. I grabbed my flashlight and spun in a circle, shining my light on the surrounding area. Nothing. I took a deep breath, and that’s when Oliver and Jimmy both came out of their tents. 

“What’s wrong Mike?”

“Nothing,” I said, turning off my flashlight. “I’m going to walk around the woods to find some firewood.” Before being able to say anything, Oliver took off into the woods with his flashlight in hand. We got worried after Oliver didn’t return after a few hours. 

After talking for a while, we went and search for Oliver. We grabbed our flashlights and headed off in the direction Oliver went. After walking for what felt like hours, I heard Jimmy run and say “Mike over here!” I followed him, only to see something horrifying. Oliver was strung up on a tree. His intestines were on the ground under him and his eyes were gone. I fell to the ground and threw up. Jimmy stood there frozen in horror. I ran over to him. “Jimmy! Jimmy! We have to go now. Whatever did this to him might still be out here.” After some resistance, Jimmy followed me and we ran back towards the direction of our campsite. Once we reached it we saw our tents covered in vines. “What the hell?” I whispered. I ran over to Jimmy’s tent while he followed closely behind. After grabbing the vines, I started pulling them off the entrance so I could try to get to his backpack. “Jimmy, help me with this!” I said, struggling to pull them off. “Jimmy!” I shouted yet again, receiving no response. 

Turning to where he was, I was met with a horrifying sight. The vines held Jimmy in the air. His eyes were gone, like Oliver's. The vines tore off his limbs, spraying blood everywhere. Horrified, I ran. After a while, my lungs felt like they were on fire, but I still kept running. I ran until I saw a concrete. “A road!” I said, running to it before collapsing on it. The last thing I saw before waking up in a hospital was a car coming to a stop in front of me.

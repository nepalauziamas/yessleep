I woke up this morning feeling positive for a change I have been down ever since the pasing of my twin sister. The feeling of something being missing is till hanging heaving inside my heart, but things must go on. I opened the door and walked towards my red mailbox I haven't been checking my mail since I came back home from the funeral to be precise I haven't been out of my house alot. I have been battling with depression ever since I got the call from a hysterical Johnny with the news of my sisters passing it's like I could still feel her presence her pain her thoughts I even adapted a few of her habits over this past 6 months, but today I decided I should move on for the both of us she would've wanted me to be happy which reminds me I need to check on Johnny haven't heard from him since the funeral. I took a deep breath and opened my mailbox strange there was only one big brown envelope the kind you only get important documents in  I took it out and scanned the paper no address nor a return address only my name written in some weird red substance that kind of has a strange sour smell. The handwriting looks strangely similar, but I cannot think where I saw it before. I closed the mail box and walked towards my house, but for a brief second I felt like someone was watching me I turned around to look but saw nothing I shook of the feeling and made my way inside the house. once inside I took a seat on the sofa opening the envelope a cold shiver went down my spine as I read the context of the first page. My sister's missing diary pages was now in my hands. I took a deep breath and began to read the pages.

Dear Diary

The strangest thing happened today. I saw a figure by the edge of the forest watching me from a distance he was dressed in a black robe of some sort his face covered in a white mask. I spend a good 5 minutes just staring at it from my living room window I called out to Johnny, but when he got by the window he said he doesn't see anyone and sure enough when I turned my attention back towards the figure it was gone I'm not sure what to think of it.

I saw the figure by the edge of the forest again. Standing there watching me, judging me I am sure it's the neighbors children playing a prank on me, but somehow I cannot shake the feeling of it being something more sinister.

I went for a jog in the forest to clear my head something my therapist described me to do along with some anxiety pills I haven't seen the figure nor heard any sounds maybe it was the  stress about the wedding getting to me.

Dear Diary 

I gotten a strange note with my mail, no address no return one either just a letter written in a strange red substance saying " 48 hours left"  I'm not sure what to think of it.

With shaking hands I read the last diary entry, with tears falling freely. My sister's death was ruled out as a sucide, but why do I have proof of a murder sitting in my hands. as I moved my hand to wipe away the falling tears the pages fell to the floor that's when I noticed the note written in the same red substance behind the  last diary page " 5 minutes " as I looked out my living room window I could see a figure dressed in a black robe with a white mask. with shaking hands I dialed 911, but the only sound I got back from the phone  was " Your time is up"....

As a teenager, i used to visit my dads house every  fortnight. And occasionally i stayed there for a week over the school holidays, and honestly i loved it, the freedom of doing whatever you want and... oh yeah, that...

Let me explain, it was when i was around 15-ish and as usual, i was visiting my dad for the week since it was the school holidays. Before we begin the story you need to understand the layout of the property, starting with the camp, yes... my dad lives in a camp, so much for thinking paying child support would be a good idea, nope. Anyways, the camp sat straight in the middle of the property. Then if you look out this wide opening that was basically the only entrance/exit that had a fire heater in the middle of the opening, you will see half the property which included a small amount of trees and what is called a "lucas mill" (a lucas mill is a portable mill that operates to cut wood from logs into planks) pass the lucas mill is about a 25-30 meter stretch of grass. After this there will be a fence then a thin road to get to another property then after that there will be a swamp... kinda. Behind the camp is flat land, nothing really important. 

Onto the story, i was around 15-ish, and i was at my dads for the week. And i was staring out at the property behind the fire heater. When i noticed something... unexplainable, there were 3 small black rabbits, just staring at the camp, from what i could see they didnt have any expression on their face, well... not a normal "rabbit" face. I looked towards dad that was sitting on a vinyl rocking chair that he picked up on the side of the road one day, and i said to him "hey dad, look at that, there are three rabbits over near the fence" And i pointed towards the rabbits, dad looked up from his phone that he treated like absolute royalty, pulled down his glasses and looked at me, then towards where i was pointing. Then he replied, "what is that?" In a very curious way. 

Without hesitation, he grabbed his rifle that he always sat beside him, leaped up from his chair, said to me "we got dinner tonight son!" I smiled and leaped up from my shitty kitchen chair and sped walk towards the three black rabbits. When we got not even close to the rabbits, they just, vanished. I mean completely gone, not even a trace of them, dad just looked at where they were sitting and scratched his head in a very cartoonish way. I did the same, almost simultaeniously, i couldnt believe it and i could tell dad couldnt either, "huh" dad says breaking the huge silence between us. 

Just two days later without anything happening nor any incident. I found myself waking up in the middle of the night and i couldnt help but feel like i was being watched so i i stood half way up from my bed trying to lather myself in blankets because it was a frost that night, then i rubbed my eyes then... "what is that?" I accidently spoke outloud. The three black rabbits stared right into my soul from the foot of my bed. I stared right back, noticing their blank, exposed faces werent even rabbit faces, they were human faces.. almost like they were stitched on by some maniac trying to recreate frankenstein but with rabbits. I litterally threw up at that point, i think dad knew something was up so he rushed towards my bed . After i finished throwing up i told dad in a very nausiating voice, "three.... black.... rabbits, they were... here" i could tell he was terrified, and ive never seen my dad be like this. he was so determined to find them rabbits the next morning, even went up to the nearest shopping centre and asked if they had seen any sign of them, but no one had any idea about them, and i knew no one would because they were wild rabbits, of course no one had seen them.

My dad died just a few weeks after that. They say from a heart attack, they also said it was random, he had no health issues, and barely smoked. 

And just why he had a heart attack we dont know.

(I will post part 2 tommorow, ive got to much going on at the moment so im going to take a short break.)

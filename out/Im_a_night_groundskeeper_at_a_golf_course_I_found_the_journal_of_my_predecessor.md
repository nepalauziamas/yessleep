The name’s Martin. I’m a somewhat middle- aged man doing the work of god. At least that’s what my manager made it seem like when he hired me for this boring ass position. Tho, I don’t think taking care of a fucking golf course after hours is much saintly work. Maybe to the low budget Tiger Woods wanna be’s that seem to fester this place. It’s no wonder I took the night shift.

It’s been about a week in and surprise surprise nothing is going on. I just got done doing my rounds and decided to poke around the small office they had installed close to the entrance gate. Yes, my base of operations was nothing but a glorified closet with windows facing everywhere. There was just enough room for a small double desk, a couple chairs, and of course the obligatory monitor with a couple cameras on them. I swear They just didn’t call this a security position so they didn’t have to pay me more money.

After looking around for nothing in particular, really just trying to get a lay of the land, I found a small notebook tucked away inside one of the desk drawers. Being the curious and mostly bored guy I was, I opened it up and gave the fist pages a once over. Seemed like it was just the first couple of days of my predecessor. Seemed like he was just as bored as me.

The first couple of pages were him rambling on about his kids and family events coming up. It really wasn’t anything too exciting. Until I got a little farther. I think he was about three weeks in until his entrees just got sorta weird. Here's the first one that really caught my attention.

*I’ve been noticing a few strange things happening recently. Now, that's to say working at a golf club at night isn’t weird in itself. I’m not even sure why they have me doing this redundant ass job in the first place.*

*All I really do is empty the trash and make sure the gates are locked. That’s really it. Honestly I’m just a glorified security guard and really there isn’t much to guard. Yeah you get the odd teenagers sneaking in and making out or trying to hit a few those new glow in the dark golf balls they got out now. Other than that it’s mostly quiet.*

*I had been about a month into my new job when I first started noticing weird things beginning to happen. I was doing my nightly rounds, which only consisted of me driving around a golf cart seeing the abundance of nothing that was the 100 acre golf course. When I saw what looked to be footprints in one of the sand dunes out past hole 5.*

*At first I didn’t think much of them. Plenty of golfers fish their balls out of the sand in an attempt to save a birdie, which more than likely ended up being a bogey or more. But something seemed off about these footprints. I couldn’t really put my finger on it, but they were giving off this weird vibe. So I decided to hop off my golf cart and take a quick peak, not like I had much better to do.*

*When I got to the footprints I immediately saw what was so odd about them. They were just too small. Like a toddler walking along the sand. They were way too far apart too. The stride on whoever this was must have been massive, because the gaps from one foot to the next were big, much bigger than anything I've ever seen.*

*I could still see the tracks of sand on the turf as the footprints lead back to fairway 4. I headed back onto my golf cart and drove the short distance in the same direction. There was a pretty decent sized wooded area between holes 4 and 5 so that's where I decided to look first. Low and behold I could still see specks of sand leading from the turf into the underbrush of the small woods.*

*I took my flashlight and shined it into the trees and at first I didn’t see anything. Just tall trees and shifting grass. I was about to just call it quits rationalizing that I was hot on the trail of some long gone kids that had been playing around here before my shift had started. Then I heard rustling deeper inside the wood. This wasn’t just the wind, no, it sounded like someone was walking in there. So I called out.*

*“Hey, course is closed! Whoever is in there you got about 5 seconds to come out or I’m calling the cops!” I yelled out in the most no nonsense tone I could muster.*

*The walking stopped. Somehow this frightened me even more. I stammered closer to the edges of the wood and tried shining my flashlight deeper inside to get a better look. Something moved quickly just out of my light, but whatever the hell it was wasn’t quick enough. I just made out the thing’s long gray leg as it sprinted past and went deeper into the wood.*

*I turned around and ran. I wasn’t about to nor was I even equipped to confront whatever the hell that was. Hell all I had was a fucking flashlight and a whistle. Not to mention the piss slowly creeping down my pants as I ran. When I got to my golf cart I quickly threw it in gear and stepped on the gas.*

*I stole a look back just as I got back on the main path and I could see two glowing white eyes just inside the woods up atop the canopy. They were swaying in the wind much like the trees almost like they were attached to them somehow. For some reason I slowed down and stared back. Then another set popped up and then another and another.*

That's it for that entry. I’d like to say I just laughed at that tall tale and put the notebook down. If I did tho, I’d be lying. I’m not sure if it was just being out at night in a deserted golf course or maybe it was because the lines in his writing were jagged and rushed. Almost like he was frightened when he wrote them. But that story sure as hell scared me a bit.

I found my eyes wandering up through the windows and out toward the woods near hole 4. And I’m not sure if it was just the full moon reflecting off the water or maybe my eyes were just playing tricks on me, but I could swear I just saw a couple white lights out over the canopy and within the trees go out just as my gaze met theirs.

Suffice to say I kept my ass inside the booth for the rest of the night. I kept telling myself that that guy in the notebook, whoever he was, was just telling stories. Hell, I used to do the same when I was a younger man working nights.

And those white lights out there? Well of course they were just a trick of the light on a groggy old man. I was too tired to know what I was seeing and my eyes aren't what they used to be. As day began to break and the cold darkness of night slunk back over the other side of the world, I pretty much forgot the whole thing on my way home. It’s amazing what a warm bed and black out curtains can do.

However, when I was driving into work and I could see that booth on the horizon, thoughts of what I had seen and that damn notebook crept back into my head.

Tonight I would do my normal rounds and checks. Occasionally stealing glances at those woods by hole 4. I saw nothing. I even swung by hole 5 and took a look in the dunes. No footprints at all. I ended up going back to my little booth feeling more comfortable knowing I debunked that little story.

I did, however, get bored again, and I soon found myself pulling that notebook out and flipping through some more pages. The next entry went as follows:

*After that last night I decided to take some time off. Obviously my manager wouldn’t have any of it. He was such a damn hard ass. The way he was talking you’d think the whole course would go to shit if I didn’t show up for my shift.*

*Suffice to say he didn’t believe a word of my little ghost story and honestly I don’t know why I even tried to tell him. It was only when I threatened to quit that he relented and gave me some time off.*

*It was just a veiled threat though. I couldn’t afford to lose this job. I would have just left that night if I could, but kids and bills never cease, so neither can I.*

*My first night back wasn’t all that eventful. I did my rounds and made my way back into my little booth as quickly as I possibly could. I started scribbling away like I always did, when I heard a soft cry coming from far to the left, near hole 18.*

*I immediately shot up. I figured some rich asshole ended up leaving their damn child here after hours. I swear some of these people should just have the nannies take full custody of their kids. I’m sure they’d do a hell of a lot better job.*

*I made my way out of the booth and started walking toward hole 18. I thought about taking the golf cart, but decided that I needed to hear the little kid more than get there quickly.*

*I followed the sound of the crying and called out as I did, but the kid never stopped his sobbing or even acknowledged I was calling out to him. In fact it seemed like they were only getting farther away. I sped up a bit in order to catch up. The cries took me all the way to the old maintenance building on the far side of hole 18.*

*Hole 18 was the lonely hole, as we liked to call it. The only thing that was close to the hole was the maintenance building and a small thicket of trees. I grimaced at the sight of the treeline and silently hoped the kid hadn’t wandered off into the woods.*

*I decided to check the maintenance building first. I could still hear their cries and that's really the only place they could be, well I hoped at least. When I finally got to the building I was hit with the smell of pure rot and decay. It was as if an animal had died and been left for weeks. The cries of the kid began to get muffled and I thought I was losing him.*

*I pulled my shirt up my nose and readied my flashlight. When I rounded the corner I saw what was making the hairs of my nostrils stand on end. There, laying on the front step of the building was a pile of dead animals. There were at least 30 animals laying on the step, all in different states of decay.*

*Birds, squirrels, and many other small game animals lay there dead in a heap. Some were still squirming. The look of complete horror and pain still plastered on their twitching faces.*

*What the hell could have done this? Maybe some high schoolers that watched way too many serial killer documentaries? I took a step closer and examined the writhing pile of corpses further. The closer I got the more putrid the smell became and the more I wanted to throw up. Then I heard it.*

*The familiar cries of that kid, muffled still, but louder. I stared at the pile of dead animals and a large pit in my stomach threatened to leap out of my throat. I used the flashlight to push a few of the animals away and what I found at the center of the pile made my heart stop.*

*Encaged by the small ribs of a rabbit and coated in blood and viscera lay an old tape recorder. Mashed against the play button was a small thumb. Too small to belong to an adult.*

*This was what was playing the cries I had been hearing all night. I realized that something or someone had lured me here. I felt the hairs on my back stand on end. This felt so wrong. It felt like I shouldn’t have come out here. This was some kind of a trap, I knew it.*

*The overwhelming urge for me to just turn tail and run had my heart nearly beating out of its chest. Just before I did, I grabbed that tape recorder. Then I ran. I ran like you do when you just turned off the basement lights and the light at the top of the stairs was your only salvation from the monster that lies below in the darkness. The one that feels like it's nipping at your heels every step you get closer to the top of the steps.*

*Eventually, I made it back to the security booth without much incident, aside from tripping over my own feet and falling on my ass a couple times. I was thinking about just not phoning it in to my boss. Besides what really happened? I found some dead animals and ran back here scared. For all I know that finger could have been plastic.*

*I pulled the tape recorder out of my pocket and tossed it on the desk. Which was a bad idea, because loose blood and guts splashed everywhere as it landed. Also, as it landed the tape inside popped out and landed on the desk as well. I picked it up and took a closer look. Side A was just a drawing of a little kid in a baseball cap. Side B had my name written on it.*

That’s it for that entry. I’m sure there's more but the suns coming up and I gotta get ready to hand off the shift. I am going to write this down and maybe upload it somewhere. Maybe to get a second opinion. Maybe to just have something to do other than read all shift long. Either way wherever I upload this, I’m sure there's more to follow.

I run a private campground and let me just say that I am blown away by how much this land means to people.  After [my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/kg2dnj/how_to_survive_camping_its_official_i_dont_like/) I got a lot of kind messages and generous donations from that gofundme that someone organized and it’s going to be a huge help this winter.  Almost $4000 and a bunch of other useful goods?  I’m not going to say how many of those chocolate chip cookies I’ve gone through.  They’re *delicious*.  And while I appreciate all the clothing, and although I’m perfectly happy to give Beau the bottle of rum, I am NOT going to try giving him an ugly sweater.  Especially one that matches mine.

If you’re new here, you should really [start at the beginning](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/clp5h4/how_to_survive_camping/), and if you’re totally lost, [this might help](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/comments/fz6a1d/how_to_survive_camping_index/).

I get that horses are intimidating animals.  But they’re also useful and have been used by humans for a very long time now.  I’m not personally aware of any other domesticated animal that has quite the presence in the inhuman world as horses.  Is it because a horse makes a good disguise for these creatures, since they were once more commonplace among human society, and gave them the advantage of size that other creatures wouldn’t?  Or is it because humanity has always held horses with a little bit of fear, realizing that the only thing standing between us and a messy end underneath a horse’s hooves is because the horse is *permitting* us to live?

Anyway, my most recent encounter with an unnatural horse happened only yesterday.  Christmas has been relatively uneventful, probably because I made all my mistakes last year.  I have socks from my brother and sweaters from you all, so I don’t have to worry about the Yule Cat.  I have firmly embraced the Christmas spirit so the shulikun won’t hassle me.  Perchta’s feast day isn’t until after Christmas, so I don’t have to think about her for a little bit.  Certainly there’s still lots of creatures left to worry about, but they haven’t shown up around here (yet) so I’m putting them lower on the risk scale.  If I worried about every possible threat that could show up on my land I’m pretty sure my stomach would be nothing but a giant ulcer.

I’m going to be spending Christmas day with my brother’s family.  His wife was enraged after the kidnapping of her daughter, but Tyler talked her into understanding that it didn’t have anything to do with me, personally.  The dapple-gray stallion was something from his past and I was doing everything I could to ensure that all the other creatures he grew up around stayed on the land and didn’t come after him or anyone else.  That mollified her and the invitation to spend Christmas with them came soon after.  Which is a relief, as similar to Thanksgiving, I had a bunch of invites from people that wanted to make sure I wasn’t spending Christmas alone.

Which is sweet, I guess, but I don’t like feeling like the local pity project.

I bought everyone clothing.  Plus a milk frother for them both.  Their niece gets some toys and a onesie that says ‘I’m a fairy princess’ on it because I apparently have a dark sense of humor and no self-preservation.

Otherwise, I’m keeping an eye on the various problems around the campground to see how they develop.  Beau has agreed to help with the children situation so I can at least move freely around the campsite.  He didn’t specify how he’d help, just that I wouldn’t have to worry about them ambushing me so long as I stayed off the roads.  Which is an interesting requirement and I’m not sure what to make of it.  The children are always found on the road though, so maybe it’s just a simple matter of not being where the children are and Beau is doing some mundane stalking from the bushes to make sure the children don’t come looking for me.

Unfortunately, it means a lot of hiking through undergrowth for me.  I haven’t spotted the fomorian, but I’ve found some traces of his presence.  The thorns are spreading.  They’re burrowing into the trees and rotting them from the inside out.  I can pull them out, but it’s like trying to dig out cancer.  The roots spread far and even just a tiny scrap can regenerate into a new mass the very next day.  I feel completely out of my league.  I’ve tried chemicals, fire, and every supernatural remedy I know of and nothing seems to make a difference.  It just keeps coming back and I think the fomorian is deliberately planting new patches now.  I fear that by spring, if nothing changes, my campsite will be consumed.

And then what?  Will it fester here, turning my land into a rotting wasteland of thorns and blackened vines, allowing the fomorian to wage his ancient war in his preferred element?  Or will it ignore the boundaries of old land and choke the fields that surround us?  I haven’t called a town meeting, but I fear that if I don’t figure something out, I’ll have to.  The town has been leaving me alone lately so I’m loath to involve them in anything and reawaken that sleeping bear.

I asked Bryan to see if the fairy would be willing to speak with me.  He did and while Bryan was not given an answer, I got a response myself when I *felt* the fairy approaching while hiking back from one of the thorn bush sites.  There’s a shift to the world.  Humans can feel it, like how we can tell the pressure is changing on the edge of a storm.  The approach of power, tangible in the air.  I glanced around and saw the deer and it was like the trees bowed out of its way, so that their branches did not tangle on its antlers.

The fairy is beautiful, like all of their kind.  I call them ‘they’ because I’m honestly not sure of their gender and I’m not sure the polite way to ask.  Like… can you just be, ‘hey what’s your pronouns’ to a fairy?  Folklore has left me completely unprepared for this situation and ‘they’ is a perfectly fine pronoun to use, so I’ll just stick with it.

Anyway.  Incredibly attractive fairy, riding a gigantic deer, dressed in armor and carrying a boar spear and sword.  And there I was, wearing my winter work jacket (the one I don’t mind getting absolutely filthy), stained gloves, and covered in dirt and sweat from hopelessly digging out more thorns.  The fairy didn’t seem to care a bit, but I certainly felt self-conscious.

It helped that Bryan’s dogs came over to sniff at me and tried to lick my face.  I was glad to see that they were all doing well.

“You requested an audience,” the fairy said.

“I did.  I am… concerned about the fomorian.”

“That is mine to hunt.”

“There’s been some collateral damage, though.  And… are we dealing with… Balor?”

A faint smile and a laugh.

“No.  He is of Balor’s tree, however, and was there the day he died.”

I began to ask my next question, but the fairy preempted me.

“And I am not Lugh, but I did ride in his company to that same battle.”

Ah.  Two soldiers from opposite sides of an ancient war, neither willing to admit it was over.

“So I don’t want to interfere with your battle,” I said.  I may be reckless but I don’t actually have a death-wish.  “But I kind of need to deal with the thorns he’s leaving behind.”

“They will die when he does.”

“Okay, but in the meantime-”

“Do you doubt my ability?” they questioned, their tone suddenly sharp.

“No, of course not, I wouldn’t dare,” I hastily amended.  “It’s just - this is my job - my responsibility - to take care of the campground.  I’d be a poor camp manager if I didn’t do *something* about the evil thorns growing everywhere.”

The fairy closed their eyes and dipped their head slightly in assent.  They *apologized*; so now I can check that off my bucket list.  Got an apology for a fairy, for not respecting the obligations of my title.  Making it sound so formal, when really it just means I’m the one that gets to tell Karen to piss off when she’s berating my staff about how the slushie machine is broken.

“There is another entity of disease on this land,” the fairy said.  “You may find a remedy there.”

The deer turned its head and began to walk slowly away.  Clearly my audience was over.  I didn’t quite get the answer I wanted - I was hoping they would just hand me a solution, but things are never that easy.

At least I have a starting point.  Another entity of disease.  Well, if we’re staying within Irish origins and my theory is correct… the fairy was referring to the gummy bears.

Do I need to recap?  How about I just [link you to where I talk about my theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/gewcli/how_to_survive_camping_rule_2_in_which_i_ruin/) instead?

I haven’t figured out what to do with this information yet.  I’m working on it.

Anyway, I would be remiss in this update on the various happenings around the campground if I didn’t mention the dancers.  I saw in the comments that some of you are hoping that they make a tradition out of crashing my place for a Christmas party.  Now, while the gofundme would certainly help towards recouping having the contents of both my pantry and liquor cabinet devoured in one night, it’s not an experience I’m anxious to repeat.  I’ll remind you that they left a disemboweled deer on my kitchen table.  I still don’t remember what she told me of my future but I remember I cried.

I fear that she told me about how I would die.

I’m not sure I want them to come back, lest she read my fortune again and this time I remember it.

This is why my heart sank when I heard a knock at the door shortly before sunset.  I’ve gotten in the habit of looking through the window before opening it.  Seems surprising that I haven’t had that kind of paranoia in the past, given how dangerous my life is, but these inhuman things have never targeted the house like this before.  Now I’ve got Beau showing up on my doorstep, creatures trying to attack the house directly, and the little girl being all sorts of weird so I’m understandably a little nervous.  I pulled back the curtain and found myself face-to-face with a horse skull.  Bright blue ornaments shone from the eye sockets.  I wrenched the door open.

“I haven’t baked the cookies yet but they’re break-and-bakes so they can be done real fast,” I said.

I was about to say something about boozy cider when I realized that the Mari Lwyd was alone.  I peered curiously around, wondering if maybe the rest of the dancers were, I dunno, hiding behind the bushes waiting to leap out and yell ‘surprise’ or something.  There was nothing.  Just the motionless horse skull, draped in a white sheet like a ghost.

Then it spoke.  It’s voice was not that of the lead dancer.  It was a sharp, deep sound, like the noise a wood log makes when it is thrown on top of a stack.

“Good cheer to you in this worst of years,” it intoned.  “The Mari Lwyd has come to ease your fears.”

“Uh,” I replied, desperately trying to think fast.  I had a feeling I didn’t want to lose this time.  “That sounds swell.  You’re not here to drag me to hell?”

I’m... not good at this.

“In your wake walks your death.  You feel it in each and every breath.”

“I don’t plan to die anytime soon.  At least, not by tomorrow noon.”

Look… I was having to think this up on the fly.  I wasn’t even entirely listening to the Mari Lwyd because I was desperately trying to think ahead for words that were easy to rhyme.

“The family curse lives in your breast.  But did you know it is also a test?”

“Uh, what?”

I was caught completely off-guard.  I hastily tried to remedy that into a rhyme by saying something about how I’m not a thot, but the Mari Lwyd clearly wasn’t having it.  It screeched in victory and I reluctantly stepped backwards and let the door hang open to invite it in.

It surged forwards, the sheet covering its body elongating as it moved.  Skeletal hooves appeared, barely protruding from under the hem.  It clopped into the house, its body stretching further and further.  Two sets of hooves.  Six.  Eight.  Fourteen.  The horse was filling my house, wrapping around the sofa in the living room before vanishing into the kitchen.  Finally, the sheet fluttered as it reached the end, and the last set of hooves passed over the threshold.  I took a deep breath, glanced out at the setting sun, and resigned myself for a *very* long night.

I turned the oven on and got a bottle of vodka out for the Mari Lwyd.  It hovered over my shoulder, its blue ornaments swiveling to somehow stare at me.

“FEED ME,” it demanded.

“Uh, I can make some boozy cider?” I suggested.

“*FEED ME*.”

It shoved its face against mine, the cold bone pressing against my cheek.  The ornament rolled around in the eye socket and then went still.  Waiting.  Tentatively, I opened the bottle of vodka and held it up to its skeletal jaw.  Tipped it back, until the liquid poured out into the thing’s hollow throat.  The stream of vodka vanished inside the sheet and was gone.  I poured until the entire bottle was empty and then the Mari Lwyd demanded once again that I feed it.

So I did.  I cut the plastic off entire wedges of cheese and shoved them into the things maw.  I opened a box of pizza rolls and poured the entire thing into its mouth, uncooked.  I gave it alcohol, orange juice, and two cartons of milk.  It ate my eggs, my butter, and all the cookie dough.  It even let me feed it vegetable oil and ground coffee as my pantry began to run barren.

Still, it wasn’t enough.

“*FEED ME,*” it intoned.

I leaned against the counter, exhausted, standing in the ruins of my kitchen.  A layer of empty boxes and plastic packaging covered the floor.  The Mari Lwyd waited expectantly, its elongated body stretching through the opening to the living room.

“I think there’s some hersey’s kisses on the coffee table,” I said nervously.  “Just… let me… squeeze past you here.”

I flattened myself against the wall to push my way past its body.  The sheet fluttered as I passed by.  I found the chocolate and tossed them, one by one, at the Mari Lwyd’s mouth, and it snapped them out of the air and they vanished down into the sheet.  Then, I was out.  There was no more food left in the house.  I couldn’t help but feel relieved.  Finally, this spectre would get *out* of here.

Its head continued to stare at me.  The blue ornaments rotated in its eye sockets, spinning around and around.

“FEED ME,” it said.

“There’s nothing left,” I desperately pleaded.  “I fed you everything I had.”

“*FEED ME.*”

It took a step towards me, its jaw dropping open and its eyes fixed and glittering in the light, and I realized that there *was* still food left in this house.  Meat.  Flesh.  *Mine.*

There wasn’t anywhere to flee to.  It was between me and the front door and I couldn’t open a window after sunset, not if I wanted to try my hand at fighting off both the little girl and yet another murder-horse.

In desperation, I made for the hallway. I grabbed a chair as I ran through the living room.  The house shook as the horse came for me, winding through the living room like a snake, barricaded in by its own body.  The sheet flapped like the wings of some great bird.  I threw the chair into position and jumped on, shoving the panel covering the attic entrance and knocking it up and out the way.  Another jump and I caught hold of the edge of the attic floor and hauled myself up.  I made sure to kick the chair over as I did.  I barely got my feet up behind me before the Mari Lwyd finally unwound itself and came charging down the hallway.  It screeched, the sound like nails on a chalkboard, and crashed *through* the toppled chair and into my bedroom.  Its hooves clattered on the wood floor and it reversed itself, its body rushing past me like a ghostly river, the hooves reverberating off each other to form a maddening chorus that echoed through the attic.  I carefully slid the panel back into place to block off the entrance.

It seemed I was safe.  Rule #1 of How to Survive Horses: horses can’t climb?  Perhaps the Mari Lwyd knew I was there, but it didn’t seem capable of reaching high enough to get the attic door open.  There was nothing I could do after that but wait.  The Mari Lwyd continued to race around the house, to the kitchen and back to my bedroom, an endless twisting loop of skeletal hooves, screeching its hunger the entire time.  I began to scrounge through the boxes stored up there, searching for something I could use to stuff up my ears so I didn’t have to listen to it.  Then I started looking for a blanket, because that attic was *cold*.  The whole campground is cold, actually.  This is going to be a bitter winter.

I found a blanket that my mother made.  It was the only time she’d done any quilting and it’d gone on my bed when I was a child.  It was pink and white.  I vaguely remembered seeing it in the attic before, when I was going through the boxes of things my parents had packed away to see if there was anything I should know about.  I lifted it out and unfolded it, and as I did, something fell out.

It was a journal.  Bound in leather that creaked alarmingly when I tried to peel it apart.  The pages were brittle and I hesitated, fearing that if I forced it open it would simply fall into pieces.  The book was old.

My mother had to have been the one to pack up the quilt.  So why did she hide this inside it?

I set the journal aside, resolving to look at it when my fingers weren’t numb with cold.  I huddled under the blanket and waited for the Mari Lwyd to abandon its hunt for more food.

I admit that I briefly considered seeing if I could throw something down to it to hopefully satisfy its hunger.  There *is* a mummified cat in the attic, after all.  That might count as food.

Fortunately, I did not have to resort to such a macabre resort.  After hours of waiting, the Mari Lwyd’s galloping finally slowed and stopped.  The house was silent.  I sat there under my blanket, scarcely daring to breath.

A creak.  The attic panel slowly began to rise into the air and I found myself staring at the face of the Mari Lwyd, its blue ornament eyes fixed on me, the wood panel balanced perfectly on top of its skull.  For a long moment we only looked at each other, my heart hammering, too afraid to move.

“My hunger you have failed to sate,” the Mari Lwyd whispered, “but the dawn I must go to meet.  I leave you to your fate, and the death which lies at your feet.”

Then its head slowly vanished back down through the opening.  I heard the front door bang open and the hiss of its sheet passing through the door frame.  Tentatively, I opened the attic and peered down into the house.  Morning sunlight poured through the open door , making its way to the edge of the hallway of my now empty house.

I’m a campground manager.  I wonder what my family got itself into, buying this land so long ago.  The Mari Lwyd’s words have been rattling around in my head all day.  A curse?  A test?  I wish my ancestors had taken all of this more seriously and passed along more than just tips on how to clear out poison ivy.  Still, while the Mari Lwyd refused to give me more details (I still think ‘what’ and ‘thot’ were a valid rhyme), I at least have the journal.  Once the holidays are over I’m going to contact the rare manuscripts department of the state university’s library and see if they’ll be able to help me read it without destroying it.  It’s a heck of a drive, but it’ll be worth it for some answers.

And while all my food got eaten again...at least I’m not cleaning deer guts off the floor this year. [\[x\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/)

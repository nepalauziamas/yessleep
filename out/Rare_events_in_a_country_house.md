Two summers ago, I went to my singing teacher's rural home. The small village can go unnoticed, as it's nothing of the other world (a few interesting historical sites, big rural houses and many miles of fields). I was so excited to go, because the vibe of my teacher and the other students really fit in my personality and I felt so confortable around them.

The house has two floors. The ground floor has the big dining room that used to be a rooster pen and a big terrace. The second floor is reserved to the rooms and a small terrace. First day advanced with the peculiarities of the first days, so much new things to explore and to talk, just amazing.

I shared a room with one of the students, I grab the upper bed of the bunk bed. The strange part of the room was that the window was boarded up, so no grasp of sunlight enters there. Ok, before continuing the story, let me say that I swing between opinions about the supernatural, I'm not a superbeliever, but that doen's mean I totally refuse to believe. It was sleep time. My friend was snoring and I have a bit of a problem with sound during night time, so i woke up. But I realized it was not the snoring that took me off my dreams. I was sweating like a pig and I suddenly felt a very cold blow on my back. "It must be the air stream" I thought, ready to sleep again. Oh... but the window was boarded up and the door was closed. Ok, WTF. I switched the light on and my friend complained, but kept sleeping, i really envy him. I had to go to the bathroom. Every step I made in the corridor (and this continued during all my stay) felt like someone was watching me. I pissed the quickest I could and, I don't hide it, returned to my room running like the coward I am. As I was climbing the stairs of the bunk bed, the lamp switched off. F$CK. I covered myself with the blanket and closed my eyes till I fortunately fell asleep.

The next day everything is fantastic again. The house is really magnificent. As I was talking to my teacher, I decide to point out my experience. I don't know, I had a feeling that he knew something. He looked at me very serious. Her parents died in that house and it was not the first time someone had an experience like this. Well, at least I had an explanation and I was relieved, honestly, because if it was their parents, it means it's not dangerous, because they were good people. Still, it was scary!

Nobody but another student had another experience. His was way more scary than mine. He was sitting in his bed doing some stuff when he heard the door next room open. He looked at there and there was nobody. Empty room. The dog? Nope, nobody there. He closed it, it was strange because you had to push down the latch to open the door. A minute passes. The exact same thing happens twice. He began to freak out. Then my teacher hears it and says "*Mother's name* stop already! Please." The door didn't open anynmore.

I don't know, I really never felt threatened, but for sure you had an eerie feeling anytime you were alone in that house!

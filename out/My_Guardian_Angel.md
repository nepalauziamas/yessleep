Okay, so Im probably not exactly in a good frame of mind to tell stories right now, but I figure I should write this out because what seemed innocuous at the time has me questioning if there was more to what I saw. Im a junkie, ill get that right out of the way. Ive been a user since I was young and am kinda still young, and at the time I was kicked out of my parents house. At 17 I was in full blown use. The only place I could stay were with friends, and it was at one of their houses where this story occurred. I remember the soft country air outside, the weather beaten back porch strung up with soft white Christmas lights to fill the nights slowly growing dark with a bit of illumination. I sat there, on old patio furniture straining against its rusty hinges, listening to the quiet that permeated the place. I waited for the wind to pass before cutting up my drug of choice at the time with a much abused drivers permit before snorting it up. I spent awhile out there, allowing the medication to take effect as I pulled a Marlboro menthol from a pack and lit it up. This night was simply incredible, I have a lot of issues with memory sometimes but it feels like yesterday.

I finished up before making my way inside, I whispered goodnight to my already passed out friend, centered upon an unproportionately large couch to the room with a grin. I made my way up the fading carpet stairs to the guest room and laid down. The door was still open, but at this point the opioidic bliss had taken over me and I laid down with a soft smile. I nodded out for a bit, putting in my earbuds to listen to music and closing my eyes. Eventually, im not sure how much time passed, but I woke from my enjoyment. I saw something in the corner of my eye. I wasn't alarmed or anything I was still pretty zonked, but it still caught my attention. There was something, dark shape in the corner of my vision, a bit outside the rickety door frame. I focused on it and my eyes cleared a bit. It dissipated instantaneously as  I looked at it but I swore I knew what I saw from somewhere. I craned my neck to see outside the room but saw nothing save the small table with a lamp shining red light onto the hallway from a dyed bulb. I relaxed a bit, electing to take another hit of what I had on hand and have a few drinks to steady my nerves. I did so, grabbing a couple of those canned margaritas from the fridge downstairs, I made my way back up. I shut the door to my room before plopping down on my bed.

I loaded up a spoon and then a needle before tying off and sending myself somewhere else. I was still a bit functional after the first can, but that quickly eroded after the second and I began passing in and out of reality. My vision blurred and swam as everything became pillow soft. I closed my eyes for what must have been a long time, my breathing slowed noticeably. I opened my eyes back up, barely conscious and what I saw made me try to jolt up. There was a figure, standing at the foot of my bed. Tall, thin maybe?  it was hard to tell if it had dimensions but it looked a bit humanoid, like a man wearing some sort of formal wear but his head was wrong. It wore what looked like a viel or a black cloth over  its head. It was reaching out to me and my breath seized as I slowly scooted back. I focused on it and just like that, it was gone. I was sluggishly worried at that point, I began hearing what I thought was the wind begin picking up. Whispers tickled my ears and they instructed me not to go to sleep. I was out of my goddamn mind at this point and eventually I went downstairs with my pillow and blanket, trying to get rest but the whispers followed me. I sat down on the floor, looking around to distract myself I saw into the den where my friend was KOed on the couch, the kitchen, and most of the old yellowed windows on the downstairs floor. I saw what I thought was a man that was too white to be white running across the reflection of the window as if he was inside the house. Strange things happened this way all night keeping me up. The sun rose slowly over the horizon in the back yard and it seemed like things were finally over.

   Overtime, I nomadicaly moved  from the streets, to friends houses, to rehabs, to other family. But whenever I tread too close to the abyss, he waits. Whenever Im close to OD, he keeps me up. Waiting in the corners of my vision, or my mind. I was never really sure if what I was seeing was real but Ive heard some similar stories from other users about being saved from OD similar ways. What do you all think? (will update if I see more or if more happens)

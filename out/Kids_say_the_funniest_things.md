Today my child told me that she has an imaginary friend, and they don’t like me very much. 
She told me this right after I made her eat a bite of broccoli. So I assume this is probably just her way of conveying her frustrations with me. 

May 2nd

When I told Mindy two days ago about our park trip she seemed so happy,
Now she doesn’t want to leave the house. She said her imaginary friend can’t go so she can’t go either. I knew once we got out of there she would feel fine, so I picked her up and put her in the car. I guess she was carsick. When I got to the end of our street she vomited profusely. 
When we got back inside she was fine, playing with her imaginary friend. 

May 3rd
Mindy and me were playing with her building blocks, when I got a phone call. I turned around to pick up my phone and I felt a block pelt the back of my head. I turned around “mindy! Why would you throw something at me?!” She swore up and down she didn’t do it. 

“It was Ezekiel” she said.

 “Is that your friends name?” I asked. 

She nodded. 

“Why would be throw that at Me?” 

“I’m not supposed to tell you about him” she whispered

“Why not?”

She looked down at her blocks and sighed
“He doesn’t like you”


May 4th
Mindy has been having some issues sleeping. Any 4 year old would usually sleep on their parents bed still but Mindy has always preferred her own. She sits in our bed all night and stays wide awake. It’s been like this the past two nights. When I asked her why she said she was making sure Ezekiel didn’t try to play any games with us

When I asked her what games she said she couldn’t tell

May 7th

It’s been 3 days since Mindy last ate without vomiting. I called her doctor and they said it could be a stomach bug with how much she’s puking, but by her activity that she isn’t dehydrated and most likely could be treated at home. 
I’m afraid to tell him what she’s saying, for fear he won’t believe me or that he’ll take her away. Mindy keeps saying Ezekiel wants play with us, and she can’t let him. 

When I ask her what she means she cries so hard I can’t understand her. 

I’m starting to fear this imaginary friend is thinf is going too far

May 9th
Mindy hasn’t spoken a word in two days. She keeps staring at me, I got her to eat a few bites of apple sauce but she keeps spitting it back at me. I tried to take her to the doctor but when I picked her up to carry her outside she screamed, kicked, and bit me

May 10th

I don’t think that thing is my daughter

She kept standing by my bed all night

Telling me “let’s play a game mommy. Come play a game with me”

She never calls me mommy
She’s always called me ma

May 12th 
Yesterday Mindy agreed to go play on a walk with her dad

She came back to the house alone; silent, covered in blood. 

I called the police and they’ve been investigating and testing the blood on Mindy all day, we still have no idea what happened 

May 15th
Still no sign of my husbands body. 

The blood on Mindy came back as my husbands blood

I know for sure this isn’t my child

She’s outside my locked bedroom door right now

Begging me to go play a game with her outside

“Don’t you want to see daddy?”

It's been a few days since I last wrote anything down. I've managed to expand my book fortress substantially which has significantly helped my chances for survival. The head and body no longer have a path that leads past my door which means (for the most part) I'm safe. The only issue has been food, drink and the bathroom BUT, I'm working on a book-based tunnel system that leads to the vital areas of the library.

That all may sound a bit… grandiose, but the thing is, books here continually manifest and that leaves me with an infinite amount of building material.

I hate calling them that.

Anyway, I've seen Mrs. James quite a few times just standing in ominous positions and unpredictable corners. As far as I can tell, she cannot speak or communicate in any way. It's hard to determine if she's even conscious at all or simply relying on some primal instinct. Regardless of which, neither offer any semblance of relief when it comes to my fear.

On the subject of fear, the disembodied head and subsequently headless body plague my sleep. Whenever I try to get some rest, the head comes rolling by somewhere close enough to hear and it's ALWAYS followed by the body (which, if you read my last entry you'd know is obnoxiously loud and incredibly eerie.)

I've still not been able to figure out any reason why I'm here either. I've extensively studied the changes in the library for clues but haven't found even a modicum of an idea. On the days where I'm able to avoid my ever pursuing menaces, I usually use those opportunities to acquire food. But! I did find a water bottle (one I can refill) in a drawer inside of Mrs. James's desk at reception. So at least I've been able to bring water back to my shelter. As long as I'm careful, I can usually smuggle quite a few resources back each time and that just gives me more time to scheme.

I haven't gone crazy just yet, although the constant reminder of possible death lurks somewhere between the nearby shelves, I've maintained a level of objective sanity. I'll leave it at that for now and I'll do my best to update you soon.

So, it's been over a week.

A week… maybe more? Maybe less. I can't even tell anymore. The light in here never changes and my phone, the one I'm using to write this stuff, seems to have malfunctioned in such a way that neither the calendar nor the time work. 

But, I do have some good news!

A couple days ago, I was out trying to once again discover my purpose for being here. Unfortunately, I miscalculated the positions of the head and the body.

While I was perusing one of the study rooms, I made a classic mistake. I didn't pay attention to where I was in the room in accordance with the doorway and before I could even react; it was too late.

The tumbling sound of the head quickly entered the air around me and I turned to see it rolling directly towards my legs. I tried to kick it, but it latched its teeth onto my shin and I let out an agonizing scream.

I reached down with both hands and gripped the sides of the head in an effort to pry it off my leg. But then, the scurrying sound of footsteps swiftly invaded the room and when I looked up, I saw the fastly advancing headless body.

While acting the best I could, I decided to avoid the body for the sake of running. Even if the head was gnawing at my flesh, at least I could put some distance between me and the body.

I ran through the library which had changed again and not in my favor. I was looking for my shelter because at least being there meant I was relatively safe (in my mind) from everything else and I could deal with the head alone. I looked over my shoulder to see if the body was behind me but it wasn't, and as I turned a corner I bumped directly into Mrs. James.

I fell backwards to the floor and the head laughed as the pressure from its teeth got stronger. I ignored the pain and stared at Mrs. James for a short while, she didn't move and I was lost in thought. Then, the head clenched its jaw harsher than ever before and it prompted anger in me. I stood up and grabbed the closest (and particularly large) book I could find.

Its eyes turned up towards me just as I was slamming the book against it. One heaving blow after another. The head produced a gurgling blood sound and a raspy screech but I did not stop until it was nothing but a mess of viscera and blood-soaked gray matter.

After I was certain it was dead, I sat down with my back against a bookshelf. Mrs. James hadn't moved an inch the entire time and I stared directly at her horrifyingly disturbing head from my seated position.

My leg was bleeding, bad too, if I didn't get it cleaned and patched up soon, I'd be in trouble. But, I haven't really been able to catch a break since I've been in this place and that instance was no different. The pitter-patter of the frighteningly familiar body was approaching; it probably had a connection with the head and knew where I was all along, silly me.

I wasn't going to be caught off-guard this time though.

I stood up, ran down the long shelved corridor and stopped at the end where two diverging paths met. To the left of me was a medium sized shelf in height, precariously stacked far higher with books of all shapes and sizes. That gave me an idea.

Mrs. James was still standing idly about midway down the corridor when the body rounded the corner at the far end and proceeded to quicken its pace directly towards me. As it passed by Mrs. James, I readied myself.

It crawled, fast and determined and I pressed my hands against the base of the book stack. I waited and waited, for the right moment. And then, I pushed with all my might and watched as the stack toppled over and landed right on top of the headless body. That visage of scurrying death writhed under the books as a pool of blood slowly began to soak the carpet.

I stomped on top of the books to add some more weight to them which only caused the body to writhe more. I looked up at where Mrs. James was, but she had disappeared, to where, I didn't know.

I felt weak and I realized it was because of the wound in my leg, and then, I passed out.

My vision was blurry when I next awoke. I felt for my leg and reeled back in pain; it stung and burned. Then I remembered my run in with the crawling body and immediately looked to see if it was still under the toppled books.

It was and what's more important is it wasn't moving.

I tried to stand but my leg had lost enough blood to feel too weak and numb making it extremely difficult to walk. I chose to crawl instead of walking; it was my goal to get to the vending machine where I could acquire some medicine for the pain and potentially something for disinfecting.

Mrs. James wasn't down that particular bookcase corridor anymore but the mess I made with the disembodied head had dried and soaked into the carpet. It formed a deep red stain that would likely never be removed. Who would care anyway? Certainly not me, even IF this place becomes my permanent reality.

I crawled to the break room and hoisted myself up so that I could see into the machine. It had earplugs, goggles, safety glasses, bandages of varying shapes and sizes, painkillers, sleeping aids, tissue, toothpicks and toothbrushes; it had mini toothpaste, scissors and even nail clippers but nothing for disinfecting. I wondered if I was still early enough to clean the wound without worry of infection because if I wasn't, that would surely mean my demise.

I wrapped my leg with a gauze-like bandage and attempted to stand again. I was at least able to maintain a limp although I moved rather slowly. It was my goal to get to the bathroom and clean the wound as best I could.

When I hobbled out of the breakroom, I THOUGHT I saw movement in the direction of the bathroom. It was a tall, dark shape but fleeting and gone as soon as I turned my head. By that time, I was assuming that my blood loss was causing false visions despite the shocking things I had already seen. Who wants to believe they're actually trapped in some sort of private hell where something new manifests at each moment of reprieve?

My arm felt cold as I leaned it against the wall leading towards the bathroom. I was using it for support and my head was starting to swim. I didn't want to black out again, especially not out in the open, not like before. 

I think I probably got lucky earlier. Any number of dangerous entities could have descended upon me in my vulnerable state.

Anyway, I rounded the short corner connecting that side hallway to the bathroom corridor. The bathroom was a singular unisex room with several stalls and sinks. When the door came into view, I froze.

An exceedingly tall man wearing a tattered trench coat was slipping inside of the bathroom. He leaned down to fit through the doorway and he didn't seem to notice me. I NEEDED to get in there because I'd be out of luck if I didn't clean this wound diligently soon.

Once the door closed behind the man, I crept up to it and put my ear against it. I couldn't hear anything happening on the other side, but… maybe he was friendly? I mean, that's what I was thinking to myself at that time.

Now I know that's not true.

Well, I decided that if I was going to die, I'd rather it not be slowly and with immense pain from a festering leg wound. So I pushed through the door but kept an air of vigilance around me.

The man was nowhere to be seen. Like he had completely disappeared. Like the bathroom was somehow a gateway to another realm, much like how I arrived here in the first place. Him not being there lifted my spirits and graced me with a sense of safety, I could take care of my leg in peace. At least… that's how it seemed.

I propped my leg up on one of the sinks and unraveled the bandage. It already looked gruesome, the wound that is; it was a mess of dried blood and exposed muscle. The moment the water touched it, I winced from the stinging pain it created. It was excruciating and I bared my teeth while gently dabbing the wound with a paper towel. Furthermore, I was trying my best not to open the wound again.

My eyes were so focused on my wound that I hadn't even bothered looking in the mirror. I wish I would have right away because the moment I did, I froze once again.

A pair of shoes were poking out from under one of the stalls. I guarantee you they weren't there when I came in, unless I somehow lost my perfect vision. I could see that the shoes weren't empty and my eyes slowly began to scan the stall door all the way to the top.

What I felt when they reached the top I can only liken to a mini heart attack because rising above the stall door, looming like a devious shadow, was the man.

His face was sullen and gaunt, deeply sunken in like he was malnourished. He didn't have irises but he did have pupils and they were staring into the mirror, directly at me.

I quickly pulled my leg off the sink and began to limp towards the door. I glanced over to see the man's hands grip the top of the stall as he pushed the door open with great ferocity. I barreled through the door and limped as quickly as possible around the closest corner and out of sight. 

Despite the library's changing nature, I had memorized some of the familiar areas that didn't seem to alter as often or not at all. This was fortunate for me because that meant my shelter was always in the same spot. I crouched down behind a short bookshelf and peered over the top. The man came into view and surveyed the open entrance area of the library while breathing intensely. His gaze never met mine and he ended up stomping off in a different direction.

I used the opportunity to slip away and get to my shelter. Mrs. James was standing outside of my large book door and any amount of nerves I had left were torched from fear. I took a few deep breaths and forced the book door aside. I crawled into my shelter and pulled the book over the entrance behind me.

Then, I sat still. I remained quiet and I listened.

There were faint stomping noises in the distance, but as it stood (and as far as I was concerned) I was in the clear.

I couldn't stop thinking about how I'd handle this new threat. I managed to deal with the previous one, but it was mostly by accident. 

I'm feeling exhausted.

I'll update you soon and I hope for the love of ANYTHING that he doesn't find me. Mrs. James doesn't hold a candle to him and quite frankly? I sense he might be even more dangerous than the head and body.

Hopefully I don't have to find out. Anyway, I'm not feeling well.

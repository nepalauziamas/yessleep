Redwood bus stop. That’s where I saw him for the very first time. He was sitting on the bench on the otherwise deserted sidewalk and staring out into the road. The day was misty and the clouds in the distance looked gloomy and foreboding. His battered green raincoat and disheveled hair looked as though he’d spent countless nights without a roof over his head. 

I had decided to take a shortcut on my way home from the supermarket. It was my daughter Sophia’s birthday, and I wanted to avoid traffic. The shortcut meant that I’d have to get off the highway and onto a derelict road, but I thought it would be worth it in the end. Boy, was I wrong.

Before I continue telling the story, dear reader, I must tell you that I am definitely aware of the dangers typically associated with picking up hitchhikers. I’ve heard my fair share of horror stories involving strange incantations, violent outbursts, and vomit on car seats. However, I also consider myself to be a fairly good judge of character, or at least I did.

The road in question was surrounded on each side by a thick forest. There were no other cars aside from mine, and no buses ever came through here, despite there being a bus stop. The man didn’t even raise his head at the sound of my approaching car, so I figured he was just minding his own business. After all, the forest was well-known for its trails. However, as I got closer, he suddenly shifted in his seat and raised his thumb.

Startled, I hit the brakes violently and grit my teeth as my car came to a halt. I hadn’t really intended to stop, but it felt rude to keep driving now. I could see the man staring at me through the window, his thumb still in the air. I figured he was probably waiting for me to give him some sort of sign, so I mouthed ‘okay’, and leaned over to open the passenger door.

Now, I know what you’re thinking. A hitchhiker on a derelict road already sounds like trouble, but he didn’t really look dangerous. Sure, he was unkempt and scruffy and – granted if it’d been my wife in the driver’s seat, I would have insisted she keep driving. However, I am in pretty good shape, and I figured I could take him if he tried anything.

I watched as he got up from the bench slowly and approached my car. 

“Hello,” I held out my hand to him as he sat down in the passenger seat, “What’s your name?”

“Jerry,” he didn’t acknowledge my hand, or even so much as look at me.

“Where are we going, Jerry?”

He was silent for a moment.

“Home to my wife and kid.”

I chewed the inside of my cheek, wondering if perhaps I had made a mistake inviting him into my car. 

“Do you know the address?”

He shook his head, and I couldn’t help feeling a bit sorry for him. Perhaps he was suffering from early onset dementia or maybe he didn’t even have a family to begin with. However, I didn’t really have time to spare, and his brief answers, or lack thereof, were getting on my nerves. 

“Alright then, could you show me where to go?”

To my surprise, he nodded and pointed straight. We drove in silence, as he directed me along several streets. I felt relieved, as I realized I wasn’t really going off course. Wherever he lived, it seemed to be pretty close to my place.

“Oh! We’re neighbors!” I exclaimed as he indicated a right-turn with his hand, “This is my street!”

He hadn’t said a single word since we’d started driving and he didn’t look like he was about to start now. I kept giving him side glances, but he seemed totally fixated on the road.

“So, which one is yours?” I slowed down, as we cruised along a row of colorful houses.

He gestured to keep driving, so I did.

“Weird, I’ve never seen you a-“

He waved for me to stop. 

“This is me,” he said, pointing to a pale cream house.

I followed his gaze and my heart dropped.

“No,” I swallowed, “That’s my house, Jerry.”

But Jerry was already getting out of the car.

“Thanks,” he mumbled, before slamming the passenger door shut.

“Wait!” I protested, my pulse racing, “Where are you going?”

But he didn’t seem the slightest bit interested, as he made his way up the stone steps leading to the front door. 

“What the hell,” I said to myself, turning the engine off.

I couldn’t really leave my car in the middle of the road, but I had absolutely no intention of parking it either. Jerry had just rung the doorbell when I shoved the car door open and sprinted up the steps. 

“Jerry! Wait!”

The front door flung open, and my wife Emma appeared in the doorway. She surveyed us for a moment and then wiped her hands on her apron.

“Hi hon!” she exclaimed, “Who’s your friend?”

I was out of breath by the time I reached them.

“This is Jerry,” I gasped.

Emma chuckled.

“With a sense of humor, I see! Well, come on in!”

We gathered in the hallway and Jerry still hadn’t said a single word.

“So, did you two meet at the mall?” Emma asked.

Jerry was silent.

“I picked him up at a bus stop,” I said.

Jerry and my wife exchanged glances.

“Did you get candles for the cake, like I asked?”

“No, they were out of-“ I began, but Emma gave me a disapproving look.

“I was actually asking my husband,” she said.

I gaped at her, and then at Jerry, who was busy rummaging through his coat pocket. 

“Found them at Dale’s,” he said.

“Uh,” I stammered, leaning on the wall for support, “I’m sorry?”

“It’s a store downtown,” Emma explained, “Are you not from around here?”

I blinked at her.

“Are you asking me?”

“Well, who else would I be asking?” she said, with a giggle.

My skin was prickling.

“Uh, can I talk to you in the kitchen?” I asked.

She glanced at Jerry, who gave a quick nod.

“Sure.”

I practically dragged her to the kitchen and shut the door behind us.

“Okay, what’s going on?” I demanded.

“I’m sorry, Mr…?”

I stared at her.

“Stop it, Emma, this isn’t funny,” I said.

She looked blank.

“I’m Ian! Your husband!”

She chuckled.

“My husband is Jerry, as far as I’m aware.”

I seized her by the shoulders.

“Please stop, it’s not funny.”

“Mr. – sorry – Ian, I have no idea what you’re talking about. Now, if you’ll excuse me, it’s my daughter’s birthday and I have to check on the dinner.”

My stomach lurched.

“Emma, please,” I said, “What will Sophia think of this?”

She froze.

“How do you know her name?” her tone was stern.

“What? Because I’m her father, I know everything about her! I know she had a teddy bear named Jeremy when she was little, I know she hates Christmas carols and I know she has a heart shaped birthmark on her shoulder!”

Emma’s face flushed red. She dropped the oven mitt she was clutching and stormed past me into the hallway.

“What’s wrong with you?” I heard her exclaim, “He’s a stranger!”

“Don’t worry about it,” Jerry said quietly, “He’ll be out of our hair soon enough.”

“What?” I entered the hallway, bewildered, “What did you just say?”

They both stared at me.

“I just said,” Jerry cleared his throat, “That I’m going upstairs.”

He followed through, trudging up each step slowly, and I knew he was listening in. I rushed over to my wife as soon as he was out of sight.

“Emma, listen. I don’t know what’s going on here, but if you had an affair, it’s okay, I understand. I’ll get rid of him, I promise, just go to the kitchen, and wait for me.”

Her expression changed.

“How dare you?” she cried, “Jerry is my husband!”

“Jerry is absolutely not your husband,” I laughed in her face, “Why would a beautiful woman like yourself ever marry a sullen old man?”

I knew Jerry was hardly any older than I was, but I couldn’t help myself. Besides, his disheveled look added at least two decades to his appearance. But Emma didn’t seem to think so.

“I suggest you leave now, Ian,” her tone was strict, “Before I call the police.”

I snorted.

“I paid for this house, Emma, I’m not going anywhere.”

I noticed Jerry reappear on the stairs.

“Oh yes, you are,” he said, rolling up his sleeves, “We don’t want any trouble.”

I gawked at my wife, as Jerry came down to escort me through the front door.

“Here’s fifty bucks,” he said, as soon as we were out of earshot, “It’s all I got, but it should be enough.”

“What?” I felt blood draining from my face, “Enough for what?”

“For your troubles. Oh, and Ian, don’t bother calling the police,” he hesitated, “They won’t be able to do much.”

“What the-“ I started, but he shut the door in my face.

I stared at my own front door with a growing feeling of helplessness. I couldn’t even begin to wrap my mind around what had happened. How could one wrong move have caused my whole perception of reality to go spiraling out of control? I wanted so badly for this to be a dream. I longed to wake up and tell Emma all about this crazy adventure, but as much as I willed myself to, I wouldn’t wake. My arm was covered in pinch marks, and worst of all, my wife seemed to have absolutely no recollection of me or the ten years we had spent together. 

I wanted to cry, but my tear ducts seemed to be paralyzed. My entire sense of being, the life I had worked so hard to build up for my family had been reduced to this – a mere fifty bucks. This had to be a prank. A prank, a dream, a joke – anything but reality. How could she not remember me for God’s sake?

I had no idea what time it was, but the setting sun suggested it was getting quite late. I stood outside on my own front lawn like a stray dog, unsure of what I was waiting for or what I was supposed to do. All I had to work with was the damned fifty bucks.

Suddenly, the lights came on in the dining room. The curtains weren’t drawn, and I could see Emma entering the room from where I was standing. She was carrying several dishes and set them out on the table. Sophia ran in behind her, carrying a bottle of soda. I watched them with a growing feeling of despair. They sat down on either side of the table and seconds later, a man joined them.

I didn’t even recognize him at first. He had shaved, trimmed his hair and was wearing one of my best dress shirts. He leaned down to kiss my wife and ruffle Sophia’s hair. She clung to him like a little monkey. Anger welled up inside of me. This son of a bitch was going to live in my house, bed my wife and raise my daughter. Well, not on my watch.

I walked over to the front door and tugged at the handle, to no avail. It was locked. This was a safe neighborhood and my family had never locked the door during the day before. He was already enforcing his own rules. Well, no matter. I circled the house, found a large enough rock, and threw it with all my might at the kitchen window. It shattered, sending shards of glass flying everywhere. 

In retrospect, I’m not sure what I was thinking. I was so overwhelmed by the day’s events, that my mind was likely malfunctioning, causing me to make questionable decisions. I climbed in through the window and marched straight towards the dining room. However, Jerry was already waiting for me in the hallway. 

“Don’t come any closer,” he said as soon as he saw me.

“This is my house, Jerry,” I said, “You can’t have my family.”

I saw Sophia peeking at us from around the corner.

“Daddy, who is that?” she whispered.

Jerry turned to her and put his finger to his lips.

“I’ll take care of it, sweetheart, run back to your mother.”

I watched the interaction dumbfounded. 

“You have to go, Ian,” Jerry said sternly, “I don’t want my daughter seeing this.”

I couldn’t control myself any longer. I charged at him with clenched fists, fully intending to kill him. My temples were throbbing, but my mind was quiet. All I could see was red. But before I could even reach him, before I could take my first swing, a loud bang pierced the air and I collapsed on the floor. 

I’d always wondered what it was like getting shot. I wondered whether the pain was quick and searing or slow and stinging. It felt like nothing at first, especially considering I hadn’t even seen him draw the gun. I didn’t even know I’d been shot until I was lying face-down on the ground in my own hallway.

He had aimed for my foot. At least that’s where the pain was. I felt two steady hands on me as I was pulled up and seated against the wall. 

“Now,” Jerry said, “Listen to me carefully.”

I stared at him. There was absolutely nothing else I could do. He was the one with the gun. 

“I want you to leave me and my family alone, do you hear?”

My foot was throbbing uncontrollably, but there wasn’t as much blood as I’d expected. 

“Do you hear?”

I nodded, licking my dry lips. Jerry brought me a glass of water from the kitchen.

“Let me help you,” he said, pulling me upright. 

He helped me out the front door and sat me in the passenger seat of my car. Then, he circled around and got in beside me. 

“Keys,” he demanded, holding out his hand.

I pulled them out of my pocket and placed them into his palm. 

“The nearest hospital is two miles away,” I whispered.

“Don’t worry,” Jerry said, “I know where I’m going.”

He didn’t. As we drove across town, I realized we were going the completely opposite way. Perhaps we were heading to another hospital up north? I didn’t have the energy to argue, so I left the decision-making up to him. 

Suddenly, he made a sharp turn, and I recognized the street where I had picked him up that same afternoon. Surely, he wasn’t planning to-. 

“We’re here,” he said, unbuckling his seat belt. 

“But-“

But he was already out the door and walking around the car. He opened the passenger door and helped me out. 

“Why are we here?” I demanded.

He didn’t seem to be listening.

“You got the money I gave you?”

I nodded.

“You’ll be fine,” he assured, leading me to the bus stop. 

He sat me down on the bench and seized me by my shoulders.

“Goodbye for now, Ian,” he smirked, “And thank you for the ride.”

“Wait!” I yelled after him, but he was already walking away. 

He turned the car around and within seconds it was like he’d never even been there. The sun had long since set and the street was enveloped by darkness. There were no streetlights and the forest on either side of the road whispered ominously. 

I couldn’t walk, I had nothing to eat, and my clothes were not nearly warm enough to survive the night. Tears of desperation rolled down my cheeks and dripped onto my lap. I was doomed. 

Suddenly, I noticed bright lights in the distance. I watched them getting nearer, my heart filling with hope. I took a deep breath and stuck out my thumb.

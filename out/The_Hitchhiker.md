Once upon a time before the first stones of any city had been laid. A man stood watch over the tribal fire his family slept beside and starred up at the sky, when to his wonder one of the stars broke from its place and fell down to the earth in a fiery splash.

Though afraid, the man pressed himself on to investigate, and after making his way out of the forest to the ridge of cliffs and valleys found the spot where the star had pierced the earth.

At the base of a small crater the man saw a shadowy figure emerge, by the shape of it the figure seemed to be trying to compose itself before noticing the encroaching rays of the sun, at which it fled at a panic towards the caves in the nearby cliffs.


The man waited until sunlight filled every crevice of the valley before he himself moved an inch.


He approached the cliffs where the figure had seemed to take refuge and crept up to the entrance of the large hollow cave.


With spear in hand the man approached the wraith, who in turn beckoned in the man further inside.


And so this whisper took the man and heard his inner most thoughts, and by seducing the man with the ability to subjugate his former foes and control the adoration of their women so convinced the man to open his ears and listen to the shadow with his utmost intent.


The wraith taught the man how to melt the stones of the valley in to a blade that could fell any spear and into armor to withstand any blow, and it taught him how to meld the jewels in the river stones into glimmering ornaments for the body.


And with this new power he returned to his people and he first killed every man he used to call friend, then taking their wives for his own he bore from them sons to whom he taught the secrets he now knew.


As the sons of the man spread out and conquered and seduced all they set theirs eyes on. Though they soon found that with no more foreign lands and people to reign, the fight for supremacy became brother on brother and so it was again that man met upon man to a stalemate of equal combat.


Only the first born son of the man had been made privy to the true secret of their power, and where the knowledge came from, and he had long since taken efforts to secure the cave as a scared temple and forbidden place, through this he alone was taught further secrets on the arts of weapons and means of control, tools that were then used to reestablish his own dominance. Though again the true secret of this knowledge was reserved only to sons of the first.


As the centuries went on a city grew around the temple and a civilization sprung on the worship of the gifts from the temples priests. And the highest status went to those with the most intricate jewellery and arms.


But as the material tyranny of this new city spread so to did resistance to it and soon armies rose up to challenge the city walls.

So the sons of the man, now claiming the roles of these priests of the temple consulted the shadow deep in the cave within the temple vaults.


The whisper brought them new ways to make metal, arms and potions that could beat the rebellion back and reimpose their dominant status quo.


Though soon enough the quarrels returned to be among the cousins and brothers themselves and it went on this way until the insatiable lust for arms and power came to be that there was no request to sordid, no taboo unquestionable, no evil that wouldnâ€™t be done, If it was to result in more gifts from the shadow of the cave.


And the sons of the man went on this way generation after generation, until after they had been guided along the path enough to understand the most intricate and complex gifts the shadow planned to offer, and as the years finally brought the bloodlust enough fuel the shadow in the cave taunted mans desires so that one eventually stepped forward, twisted enough to take the shadows most powerful gift, the ability to eradicate the world entirely.


And in them doing so it had hoped to hitchhike the cataclysmic destruction of their world to its own immaterial end. No matter how faint the odds the suicidal entity was more than willingly to burn through another inconsequential world on its journey through the stars.

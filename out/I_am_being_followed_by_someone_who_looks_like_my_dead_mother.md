It was about two weeks ago when she started following me. I had just left the local bar walking to my house two blocks down, that’s when I saw her, my mother was across the street from me. “Mom?” I yelled in a confused voice. She didn’t respond so I got closer, and then that’s when she started walking towards me. I was so frightened that I started sprinting home, when I got there I looked back. She was there walking slowly but creepily. I unlocked my door in a hurry and locked every entrance in my house. I looked out the living room window to see her there right outside the front door, just sitting there staring at the door. I had everything locked so I just went to bed, my biggest regret.


It was 4 o’clock in the morning when I heard my front door open. My bedroom door was so open, so I peeked into the hallway connected to the living room and there she was. Staring at my room doorway, I panicked and jumped out my window and got in my car to call my friend. He picked up. “Hello?” He said in a confused sleepy voice. “Can I come over it’s urgent” I said in a panicked voice. “It’s 4:30 in the morning” he said in a annoyed voice. “Please I need somewhere to go” I said very fast. “Fine” he said in a annoyed voice. Then I saw her walking out the front door, walking towards my car. I drove out of the drive way and flew to my friends house.


When I arrived I banged on the door I could hear him walking towards the door. The opens the door. “What’s going on?” He said I explained what was going on to him, confused he says “I guess you can spend the night so I did. I woke up at 10 am and didn’t see any sign of her. So I went to work, I am an electrician and pretty much work an hour out of town most of the time. This job was 3 hours away so I started driving. On the way I see her on the side of the road looking at me. I slow down and she charges at my car hitting the passenger side, I slam the gas petal and speed down the road. That’s when I thought to call my dad who was very religious, I thought maybe he would know what was going on. I called and told him what was going on. He hung up terrified, he hasn’t talked to me since. So I just continue my day as normal and finish the job. When I got home I was watching a movie when I head glass shatter in the kitchen. The back sliding door was broken.


Terrified I grabbed my revolver that my dad gave me for my 21st birthday, and I saw her she wasn’t my mother it just stared at me before charging at me. *gunshot* I missed at this point I thought I was going to die. Then someone entered the front door, my dad he scream “MOVE SON!” I jump out the way he shoots his shotgun hitting whatever it was. He then explained to me that there was a creepy man who was digging graves and taking the skin from the dead and that my mother’s grave was disturbed. Then I pull the skin off the guy and it was an escaped criminal from a mental facility. My dad killed him.


To this day I have nightmares about that night and it haunts me to think that some guy ripped the skin of my mother’s dead corpse.

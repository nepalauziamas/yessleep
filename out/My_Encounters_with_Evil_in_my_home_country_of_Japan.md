This was my first encounter with the darker side of humanity and potentially my first encounter with the paranormal.

This is the story of a nightmarish encounter I had as a young boy living in Japan. I was a very quiet child and often kept to myself. That's why I often walked home alone which in hindsight was not the wisest of choices of a boy to do. However, both my parents worked and didn't have time to pick me up. So, to make it easy on everyone I would walk home from school.  

I was a young boy walking home about maybe 9 or 10 years old. I remember the rain was pouring down hard and not even my raincoat was of use. I was looking up at the light and eagerly awaiting it to turn signaling for me to walk across.

It felt like an eternity had past then a woman with a surgical mask walked up to me and shielded me with her umbrella. She asked me if I was okay, and I nodded we crossed together and then she tells me she had a question. She dressed in white and was covered by a long coat and her head was partially obscured by this round hat while her face was partly shielded by a surgical mask which I didn't think anything of at the time.

Then she pulled off her mask and asked me "Do you think I'm pretty?" I was mortified her face had horrible scars around the mouth. I was speechless and visibly frightened. This made her angry and she asked again "Do you think I'm pretty?"

In fear I shouted "Yes!" hoping this would make stop and leave me alone.

It didn't work and she screamed "Liar!" I insisted I wasn't lying but she said, "Well how about I make you pretty just like me?" next thing I know she took out a knife and swung it at me. So, I moved as fast I could dodge and run. The whole time I kept thinking I was going to die. Looking back I probably would have if I hadn't gotten so lucky.

I kept running eventually running blindly into the street barely getting hit by a car. I heard thump or something and quickly turned around seeing she had been hit by the car. I froze for a second thinking she was dead but as soon as the driver got out to check on her, she lifted up her head and gave me this crazed look like a rabid animal.

I ran once more and didn't stop until I got home. I never found out what happened my parents told me there had been a man hospitalized for multiple stab wounds but a woman matching her description never turned up. After that my parents drove me to and from school, but I would hear similar stories from other kids about a woman approaching them or their parents, neighbors asking them the same question "DO YOU THINK I'M PRETTY?"

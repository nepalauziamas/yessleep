I fixedly stared at my computer screen as I carefully listened to the voice from that YouTube video like my life depended on it. I listened again and again, telling myself it couldn't be possible, surely it was just some random guy with a voice that just so happened to be very similar to mine or perhaps I was just getting nervous and my paranoia was tricking my senses into hearing something that didn't correspond with reality. I listened one final time, it was 2:30 A:m and I desperately wanted to go to bed, but I had to make sure or else the intrigue wouldn't let me sleep anyways...yep, now I was convinced, no...I was fucking POSITIVE of it, as absolutely nonsensical as it seemed, the voice from that video was none other than my own.

"*Heinrich's gaming room*" That was the name of that YouTube channel. Heinrich was indeed my name, in fact, I visited this channel because YouTube's algorithm recommended it to me out of nowhere and I thought it was cool because it had my name and had videos featuring many videogames I was familiar with.  I was your average 19 year old college student still living with my parents in Germany. But I wasn't a youtuber, I admit I had fanaticized with the idea several times , especially when I was a young teenager in middle school, but I've never had the sufficient means nor the dedication to pull it off, I had a YouTube profile that I used to subscribe to channels that interested me and maybe leave a comment from time to time but that was it. So where the hell had this channel come from?

As far as the actual content that could be found on "*Heinrich's gaming room*" went, it mainly consisted of gameplays, as its name would suggest. Namely, they were video games from the mid 2000s to early 2010s I had grown up playing, most of them were games made by the company Nintendo, as I had primarily owned their consoles during my childhood, as opposed to my friends who had always leaned more towards Sony's PlayStation. In regards to their quality, the videos weren't unwatchable per say, but they certainly weren't stellar either, the voiceover that accompanied the gameplays especially ticked me the wrong way, and not just because it was literally my voice, but also because they were done in broken English with a comically exaggerated German accent that almost made me think the channel was trying to be some sort of parody.

"I can speak English way better than that!" I thought. By that point, I was exhausted, so I decided to call it a day and go to bed.

The next day I checked the mysterious channel once again and to my surprise, a brand new video had been uploaded as recently as a couple minutes prior. It was the continuation to a gameplay series in which my doppelganger played Yoshi's Island DS, an unfairly overlooked game for the Nintendo DS which is actually a sequel to the critically acclaimed original Yoshi's Island for the Super Nintendo.

"Alright everybody, we're going to continue playing Yoshi's Island DS. We're going to pick up from where we left off the other day at the start of world 2..." said an all too familiar voice in its characteristic German accent. He then continued playing the game normally making a few unremarkable comments here and there until he said something that send shivers down my spine.

"Funny story, I first played this game back when I was seven years old and I bought it from my good friend Dieter, he actually sold it to me for two euros in the middle of the school playground. I still have the original box for the game and it still has Dieter's name written on it. " the voice said before letting out a light chuckle.

My body trembled in shock as I listened to the voice in disbelief, it was true, all of it was true. I still remembered that day as if it had been yesterday, I remember how Dieter almost got caught by our teacher trying to sneak the game inside the school, I remembered how he wanted to sell it to me because his grandmother thought all video games were compatible with all consoles and so she bought him a Nintendo DS game even though he had a PSP, I remember Dieter's name written on the game's box. Just to make sure, I went to check the drawer in my bedroom where I kept my old toys and videogames...there it was, the very same box containing the game Yoshi's Island DS, it had faded considerably with time but it could still be seen, on the back of the box was a name written in blue marker "*Dieter*" .

One side of my brain instructed me to stop watching, it would've been the most comfortable option, but my curiosity prevailed, I needed to keep watching, I needed to know what the hell was going on and figure out who this imposter was.

"Before advancing to the next stage, I want to go back to World 1 because one of my subscribers commented on the previous video saying I had missed a red coin on a previous level." the imposter explained. It was then when I decided to check out the comment section to see who was watching those videos, only to find there were no comments, no views, no likes...nothing. And it's not like they were disabled or anything, I could leave a comment if I wanted to, and yet there literally were no comments. I checked his other videos and the same was true, no one was watching this! So what in the world was he talking about?

"Alright guys, we've reached the end of the episode...but before you leave, I want to make a special announcement: our next gameplay will take a bit longer than usual to come out because tomorrow I 'm gonna be organizing a special livestream to show my gratitude for all your support. I'm going to show my face for the first time ever, so I hope to see you all there!" the voice announced before ending the video.

You can bet as soon as I jumped out of bed the following day I checked my phone to see if the livestream had begun...not yet, the channel's most recent video was still the one from the previous day. I had subscribed to the channel, that way I would receive a notification as soon as the stream would go live, so I decided to just go about my day normally and wait until that notification arrived.

My parents went shopping later that evening, leaving me home alone. It was then when my phone finally notified me, the livestream had begun.

"Good afternoon, everybody! Welcome to my special livestream! " the voice greeted his audience, which only consisted of myself...that's right, I was the only person watching that livestream. Judging by what could be seen on the recording, he was apparently outdoors, standing in what looked like a garden...a suspiciously familiar garden.

"Now, I see all your comments begging me to reveal my face, but first, I wanted to take you on a little tour and show you my house." he said before he moved his camera to focus on a house located  right in front of him...my house! I frantically looked out the window trying to spot him, but the garden was empty, he wasn't there! And yet, the livestream clearly showed him standing right in front of my house!

I continued watching on my phone as he approached the front door of the house and entered the building. Once again, the stream clearly showed him opening the door and stepping inside a house which looked identical to mine, but I didn't see or hear anyone opening any door outside of the livestream.

"So yeah, welcome to my house! Here we have the kitchen, the living room...it's nothing special but it's home!" the voice said as he walked around an exact replica of my house. I checked every room and every corner of the house in an attempt to find him, to no avail.

"Alright, my dear subscribers, I'm gonna head to my bedroom where I normally film my videos and once I get there I'll finally reveal how I look like!" he announced, once again speaking as if plenty of people were watching him even though I was the only spectator. I simply stood inside my bedroom with my eyes glued to the phone, horrified.

I started hearing them...footsteps, someone was approaching my bedroom.

"And here we are! Welcome to my bedroom!" The voice said as he opened the bedroom's door, and this time...I saw it open too! But inexplicably, I could not see him, I could only hear his footsteps and watch as the door opened and closed seemingly on its own.

"Look at me! Aren't I handsome?" The voice said as he filmed a terrified 19 year old with a phone in hand staring towards the camera in horror as he screamed to the top of his lungs.

The next day arrived and I got out of bed excited by the splendid reception my livestream had received. There were hundreds of comments from my subscribers congratulating me for how successful "*Heinrich's gaming room*" was becoming. Wasting no time, I quickly got to work and began recording my next gameplay video. I don't want to keep my loyal audience waiting, after all.

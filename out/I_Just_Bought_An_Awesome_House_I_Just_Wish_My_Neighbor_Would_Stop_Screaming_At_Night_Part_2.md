Hello again! That feels weird to write but whatever, I'm going with it. I know I left my [last post] (https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/v0n0tj/i_just_bought_an_awesome_house_i_just_wish_my/) with no real answers and I don't think this one is going to be any better but I thought you all deserved to know what else had happened. By the way, I ordered the cameras but they haven't arrived yet so this is just an update. 

I wish I could say nothing of note has happened since my last post but that'd be a lie. To begin where I left off, I went and looked for high quality outdoor cameras.and found a set of 3 with all of the bells and whistles. These babies have night vision, heat vision and infrared and I happened to get them at a crazy ridiculous price online. Perhaps this is why they ended up being backordered by a week. Add in shipping time and it's going to be almost two full weeks until they came in. It could have been worse but by now I'm barely sleeping and just wantÂ  to be done with this whole experience. 

I've heard that the worst kind of fear is the fear of the unknown and at this point I'm praying that's true. That once I have the cameras in place and I can actually put names and words to everything I won't be haunted by the screams or what I've learned since my last post. 

But yeah, sorry I'm rambling, here's a brief rundown on what happened. 

Despite the oddity of my neighbor's screaming and the lack of sleep this is causing me, I still had a life to live. This required me to do things such as going to the grocery store and doing yard work. It was while I was cleaning up some dead brush that I found something peculiar half buried in the dirt. 

Pulling it up and wiping it off with the rag I use to wipe the sweat from my brow I noticed it appeared to be a necklace of some sort. It was a stone of some kind, round and smooth with a hole in the top through which a cord of perhaps leather was driven. The cord was broken, pulled in a way as if it had been worn and yanked off the wearer's neck. Both cord and pendant looked old and somewhat worn away, though I was unable to tell of this was because it actually was old, or just because it had been out in the elements for an unknown time. 

Regardless, the truly striking part of the necklace, the thing that sent shivers down my back, was the design on the pendant. Near the bottom and rising to the middle was what looked to be flames dancing; above the flames a single eye stared out and it felt like something was staring into my soul. Just thinking about it makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up; I felt like someone was watching me. I looked around but saw no one and nothing to indicate I was being observed, but still the feeling remained. At the time I tried to brush it off as silliness and I shoved the necklace into my pocket and continued on with my day. 

That night though, I had a dream. I've had this dream each night since finding the necklace. It always begins the same way, me, walking inside my house, soaking wet from a torrential downpour. Trying to get warm I shed my wet clothes but for some reason arrange them in a circle around a candle flame. No matter how many times I have this dream I never see who lights the flame, it's always unlit one moment and then alive and flickering the next. And then, the flame transforms. 

I stare, unblinking at the flame as it morphs into the figure of a woman, always the same one, beautiful and majestic. I've never seen her before but in the dream I'm transfixed. Unlike her body, her eyes are a contradiction of two deep orbs of water; pure and untouchable. She dances on the candle and inside the dream I feel the most intense feeling of peace. The sort of peace you never actually feel yourself, only hear about from others. 

Outside myself though, a strange consciousness stays with me in the dream. As though I am both the participant AND the observer; and as the observer I'm terrified. Each night after the first I know what happens next but am powerless to stop the events. I'll stand there, consumed with a feeling of bliss, as she reaches out and touches my face. Flames will run across my skin as I become incapable of moving, kissing, caressing, burning, searing. Two halves of the same whole, two experiences happening at the same time. 

The flames then leap across my skin and race over my body before reaching the floor and multiplying. From there, as the observer I stand unable to help as first the room, then the entire house goes up in flames. The sight of my skin charring and searing away haunts my waking hours now as does the cackle of laughter the woman lets out as she continues to dance... 

I awaken each time clutching the necklace in my palm and it doesn't matter where I put it before falling asleep the night prior. It finds me. 

But these dreams aren't the only update. 

If you recall, I had a rather interesting experience with buying this house. The asking price when I went to look at it was already insanely low for this area but even with that I somehow managed to walk away with buying the house at a hastily thrown together auction for only $20,000. 

I could sort of understand now, why the original asking price was as low as it was, I mean who wants to hear their neighbor screaming each night, but my curiosity was still wondering why they practically threw the house away. 

Yesterday, as luck would have it, I actually ran across the realtor while we were both out buying groceries. She was in the produce section when I saw her, looking over heads of lettuce. I'll admit I wasn't completely certain it was her at first so I pulled out my phone and searched for her company. There, under a listing of their licensed realtors was her name and photo. Janet Blackwell, distinguished realtor with the company for over 10 years. 

Walking up behind her I cleared my throat and asked, "Excuse me, Ms Blackwell, is that you?" 

Clearly startled, she jumped slightly and turned around. Then she visibly tensed the moment she saw me. Something told me she remembered exactly who I was but I wanted to be certain. 

"Hi, I'm sure you don't remember me but you actually sold me a house a couple months-" 

"I remember you," she said, her manner short and brisk, gone was the sunny, cheery attitude from the showing. "What do you want?" 

I could tell her body was on alert and I could swear she even took a step away from me, pushing herself up against the mounds of lettuce she had just been looking over. 

"I'm sorry to bother you, truly. The house is lovely, it's just I was wondering-", again I was cut off. 

"Please, just leave me alone." Her words were fast and had an almost panicked air to them. She continued, "I sold you the house, my part is done, I wash my hands of the whole thing. What you do next is up to you but if you see me again please, don't talk to me." 

Something wasn't right with this, I knew it and I suddenly wanted answers. Trying to continue on I asked, "What are you hiding? What aren't you telling me?" 

"No!" she practically screamed. "I refuse to speak of it! With each question you draw yourself deeper and closer. Look, I signed my contract and received my commission for selling you that house. That's as far as my involvement goes. Good bye!" 

With that proclamation she pushed her cart away, turned and walked fast towards the exit. As she scurried away her head kept twisting and turning as though she were looking for something that was poised to attack her if she lingered. 

I still don't know what to make of that encounter but I do know it made me extremely curious to know more about my house. Luckily, if you can even call it luck, I had tucked away all of the papers surrounding the sale of my home in a safe. A large part of me, the part weirded out by all the strange happenings that have been surrounding me, wanted to leave the papers alone. Sadly, that part did not win out. 

I don't know much about what I found but, well, it was strange to put it mildly. 

The names of the sellers were easy to find. Whenever you have to sell property you're provided a deed, a transfer of ownership that lists the name or names of the seller. So it was fairly easy to find out that it was Nathan and Ashley Peters who officially sold me the property. Nothing strange about those names and nothing jumped out as suspicious in the rest of the paperwork so I did what any person does next, I put their names in to a Google search. Immediately, an obituary pulled up as the top result. 

To sum it up, the obituary itself was sparse of information. Apparently Jonathan Peters, 39, died unexpectedly six months ago. He was a avid reader and collector of remote control cars and was survived by his siblings, Nathan and Ashely Peters. Jonathan had had no other living family and was predeceased by their parents and grandparents. There would be no service. 

Something about the fact there would be no service stuck me as sad and caused me to do another search. I wanted to see if I could find out anything more about this man for whom little was written about him. 

I wish I hadn't looked. 

I was already being haunted by my neighbor's screams and the chilling dreams of fire, but one quick search of Jonathan Peters and the name of my town and I added one more thing to my growing list of oddities that was quickly becoming my new normal. Jonathan Peters was murdered. 

I looked through site after site discussing his death, most of them being forums rather than traditional news outlets. From what I could gather from verified sources Jonathan was found dead on the steps of the local Methodist church. Homicide had not been ruled out but was also not confirmed. No suspects or anything suspicious was written about and over all it's no wonder I hadn't heard of this occurring with how little coverage the event received. 

If it had only been the news coverage I might have stopped reading, chalking it up to coincidence that his death provided me the house. But there were the forum posts... Those, disturbed me. 

No one had a full version of what had occurred, how Jonathan had died, but there were plenty of details for what they did know. And each topic post was accompanied by photos of the body that must have been taken at the scene. Jonathan had burned to death. This much was obvious from the charred remains laying across the front of the church entrance way, one foot still on the top step, arm appearing outstretched towards the door. But what wasn't obvious was how there were no flame marks anywhere surrounding him. 

Multiple comments mentioned the fact that around him the scene was untouched and if his charred clothes hadn't started to disintegrate when he was touched to move him to the morgue, officials would have assumed he had died somewhere else and had been placed there. But besides the clothes, there was also his car. It appeared to have been driven to the church by himself as the front door was found open and the keys were discovered clutched in the hand not reaching out toward the church door. 

Theories and conspiracies abound on each site after the details were given. Each taking on the flair of the topic of the forum. Aliens, human sacrifice, demonic possessions, even spontaneous human combustion were bounced back and forth as reasons for the death of Jonathan. Something told me though that the only person who would have the truth lived right next door. 

I might not have the cameras to see into his backyard yet but at the very least I figured I could ask him if he had known Jonathan, perhaps give him my condolences if they had been friends. 

Closing the computer down I mentally prepared myself to go next door. But as I was opening my front door I noticed he already had a visitor. This had NEVER happened since I'd moved in but there in his driveway, parked behind his Toyota, was a black SUV. Quickly shutting the door in case I'd been noticed, I slinked back inside and raced for my bedroom so I could look out the window. 

To be honest, there wasn't much to see. Mr Carver's door was still mostly closed like it had been when I'd visited. On the porch was a tall man of unknown ethnicity in a black suit holding what appeared to be a file folder and a small box. I could vaguely tell that he appeared to be speaking to Mr Carver who I kept seeing shake his head no a few times before nodding; not speaking. 

Rushing from my window I snuck out my back door and ran across my lawn to the fence. Inching along slowly I stopped as soon as I heard the conversation.

A voice, the man in the black suit I would assume was in the middle of speaking so I heard "-Playing games! I know what is at stake and I am trying to help you but you have to verbally agree to the terms." The man sounded exasperated but still there was no sound from Mr Carver. 

I heard the porch creaking as I assume the man shifted position then, "Look, I know what it costs you but please, let me help you like I couldn't help your father." There was a pleading quality to his voice as he continued, "all you have to do is give your verbal agreement. We both know you understand the stakes, understand that your actions are your own. Let me help you. " 

I couldn't see what was happening from this position but I felt for the man,Â  whatever he was trying to do. Surely Mr Carver would take pity on him? 

But no. Instead, quietly,Â  barely above a whisper I heard "No. Now leave." Nothing more, just a shutting of the door. The man in the suit was obviously exasperated as he banged his fist on the door and screamed "Really!? You speak to me just long enough to say 'No'? You'd really spite yourself that much? You're ridiculous! You know how to reach me when you change your mind." Then he obviously turned and walked down the porch steps, stomping off towards his car. 

I dared not move as he started his car, backed out of the drive and drove away. What had I just over heard? I couldn't get a good look at him through my window but he hadn't seemed very old.Â  How had he known Mr Carver's father? 

I still had my own questions to ask but wasn't sure if now was the correct time; perhaps I should come back tomorrow? 

My hand made it's way into my pocket as I was half convinced to try another day. I felt the necklace and all thoughts of coming back another day vanished. I remember actually being strangely calm as I walked across his lawn and then up his steps and knocked on his door. 

I heard what sounded like a curse, then stomping footsteps as the door was opened even as he spoke, "You're not usually so dense! I said-". Then he abruptly stopped speaking, seeing me instead of the man in the suit. It was still dark in his entrance so I couldn't see much as he pulled the door more shut,Â  but I could tell he appeared to deflate immediately. 

"I'm sorry for interrupting your day Mr Carver," I began but he quickly cut me off. 

"No, no you're not sorry, so stop your prattling and ask what you came here to ask." He spit the words out through clenched teeth as he spoke. 

"No, you see, I am actually sorry. I just, well I came across some news and wanted to know..." I wasn't sure where to go but I knew I only had one shot. The screaming or Jonathan? Jonathan or the screams? 

"I learned today that the man who lived in my house before died and I wasn't certain if you were aware or even if your were friends or if maybe that was why you wanted nothing to do with me." 

My words came spilling out fast. A verbal deluge of information as I squeezed my eyes tight, waiting for a response, too afraid to look at him. 

"You have to be one of the stupidest people to ever cross this porch" he began, stunning me to silence. 

"I-I'm j-just trying to be a good neighbor" I stuttered, suddenly terrified. 

I could hear his breathing pick up, fast and harsh as the air vibrated with his anger. "Mark my words," he began. "We are all agents of our own fate. You can mind your own business and leave me alone, or you can continue to be a nuisance to me, making my life harder for doing so. The choice is yours but don't come over again saying you're 'just trying to be neighborly' and don't mention that cockroach Jonathan to me again!" 

With those last words literally being spit at me, he took a step back and slammed the door so hard the brass knocker swung back and forth. I was stunned. I didn't know what to think or do and I barely remember walking back to my house. 

I fumbled through the rest of the night, not tasting the food I made, dreading the night to come. I lay in bed staring at the ceiling until my eyes fluttered shut and dreams of flames and a woman with eyes of water danced in front of me. This time though, I wasn't alone in my dream. Instead, off to the side, barely out of the corner of my eye was the figure of a man. He too was soaked and disrobed before a candle as a flame woman danced for him, burned him, killed him. 

I woke, wide awake and gasping for breath as the clock struck 3am and my neighbor's screams began. 

This time, he screamed for 13 seconds. 

Its morning now as I write this, running my thumb back and forth across the pendant to stay calm. I couldnt fall back to sleep after my dream and the nightly screaming. 

It had changed again and part of me felt like it was partly my fault. 

I still haven't learned why he screams but I know I'll soon have my answers as soon as the cameras arrive. I'm just not sure I want to know anymore.

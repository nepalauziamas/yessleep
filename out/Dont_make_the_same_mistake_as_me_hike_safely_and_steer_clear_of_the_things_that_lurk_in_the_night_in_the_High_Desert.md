Hey r/nosleep! I was telling the story of something strange that happened to me on a camping trip last winter to a friend, and they recommended I share it with y’all. I’m not quite sure it’s as interesting as many of the stories you all have shared here - the only shadowy government figure in this story is a National Park Ranger who was much more pissed off than mysterious. That said, I still don’t know exactly what happened or what precisely I saw that night. I’ll let all of you out there in NoSleepLand decide how worthwhile this story is, and would welcome any insight into what I saw that night. All I know for sure is that my days pushing daylight in the high desert without a distress signal are over.

I, like many other fully domesticated Angelenos, enjoy driving out to Joshua Tree to decompress and get gnarly sunburns. I was able to snag a rare peak season campsite for a Saturday night right as camping reservations were released and left that morning as excited as a swarm of desert bees finding water. The drive up that day was about as bad as it gets. Traffic didn’t let up until just before the turnoff to SR 62, and the F-150 daredevils in each of the canyons between the towns on 62 had me puttering in the slow lane. I had hoped to get to my campsite by 2 and to get a hike or two in before sunset, but I didn’t even enter the park until 4:30. I rushed through the entrance station and decided I could fit one hike in before sunset and set up camp after dark, as non-ideal as that was.

I decided to hike out from Skull Rock. It’s a big, distinctive boulder formation. If, in the worst case scenario, it began to get dark as I was hiking, I could quickly set a heading back with Skull Rock as my waypoint. You can get away from the road quickly into the area below Skull Rock. Even though it’s so close to the parking lot, it’s a fun-to-explore maze of canyons and washes that can feel light-years away from anyone else. That day, however, that treasured sense of remoteness put my life in danger.

In my rush to get into the park, I hadn’t checked the weather. It began to drizzle after I hiked about a mile into the wash that ran through the center of the area. I pressed on for another half-mile or so, but began to worry when water began to trickle through the wash from above. There was a small, mostly disused dam about a half-mile down from Skull Rock, and I knew that any real flow coming down the wash would probably have to clear that dam. I decided at that point to bail on my hike and head back toward Skull Rock. 

Unfortunately, when it rains in the desert, it can become very dangerous very quickly. The trickle in the wash had begun to flow quickly and with force and I had to scramble up rocks to reach a ridge a reasonable distance above the sudden river. From the ridge, I could see that things were much worse than I thought they were. Rushes of water randomly cut through the terrain all the way up to Skull Rock. My only option was to stay put and wait for the rain to stop. 

It kept raining until it was dark and the water below me had kept rising and rising. This had become a survival situation, and I was not prepared for a survival situation. All I had was my now-waterlogged cell phone and my water bottle. I was able to unlock my phone with some effort, but didn’t have any service to call 911. 

It was still overcast and I couldn’t see further than 10 feet in front of my face. I decided to make the best of a worse-than-bad situation and bivouac where I was - it wasn’t ideal and I would be at the mercy of any further storms, but I couldn’t risk slipping and breaking an ankle or, worse, falling into the sudden surge below. 

The desert, particularly after a hard rain, can be loud. The wind was high that night and the sounds of insects chirping was only interrupted by the intermittent yelping of coyotes in the distance. I struggled to restless sleep after a half-hour or so. 

It was still dark when I was awoken by something that sounded like howling. I thought it might have been the wind, but I was pretty exposed out there and wanted to make sure it wasn’t a mountain lion or something like that. I rose to my feet and scanned the ten yards or so I could see around me. All I could see were two red pinpoints of light some distance away. For a moment, I was ecstatic. Maybe my girlfriend had reported that I was missing and the park rangers were coming to rescue me from my own stupidity. I waved my hands frantically and yelled for them to come find me.

The first clue I had that this wasn’t a Park Ranger in the distance was the smell. At first it was a faint odor of something rancid - a mix of decomposition and wet, unwashed animal. To my horror, the smell got stronger and stronger as the red lights floated toward me in the dark. I could hear the overflowing wash no more than ten feet behind me, and I had no idea how far the ridge I had camped on extended to either my left or right. I was trapped and armed with nothing stronger than an almost empty water bottle and something horrific and unknown was advancing on me.

The orbs continued to grow until I saw the thing begin to crest the ridge I was on. It was like nothing I had ever seen before. It was huge, maybe eight or nine feet tall, and covered in stinking and matted hair. I knew no survival tips for handling a terrifying colossal cryptid and tried to treat it like a bear, or a mountain lion, spreading my arms in the air as high as I could and yelling at the top of my lungs. The creature barely reacted, lumbering toward me with what seemed like, if anything, more interest. 

It drew up to me and dwarfed me. For a moment, we locked eyes, staring up into a pair of massive, lampred eyeballs. Its breath reeked almost worse than its hair. When it quickly moved its hands, or its paw, I flinched and slipped backwards onto my ass before hitting my head and blacking out.

I came to in oppressive, humid dark, lying on something damp and muddy. Wherever I was reeked of what I hoped were rodent droppings. A hot white pain seared through my tailbone and head. I gingerly tried to rise to my feet, and to my surprise, nearly hit my head against a low rock ceiling. Not wanting to risk a (probable) second traumatic brain injury, I carefully felt around the space around me. I hit what felt like shelves, and knocked something down that made a terrific clanging noise. I saw that it was a rusted bronze pot once my eyes had adjusted a bit. The ground was strewn with pots, tools, and yes, rat droppings. I was in some kind of shelter but had no idea where. I began to look around the shelter for some clue of where I was or how I might get out of here.

My investigation was cut short by a sudden burst of light and a shout from a Park Ranger. He had ripped a tarp off of the entrance to the dwelling and began screaming at me. Confused and a little terrified, I followed him out of the dwelling to his truck. 

I learned that I had been in Carey’s Castle, a shelter built into the rock in a remote part of the Park by an unknown inhabitant some time in the early 20th century. The ranger explained that it was expressly and severely prohibited to camp in Carey’s Castle, not to mention that it was dangerous to camp in an underground shelter during a flash flood.

I explained that I had not intended to camp there and that I had slept on a ridge twelve miles away before being startled by a gigantic creature and waking up in Carey’s Castle. This, naturally, made him even angrier. He took pains to impress on me that he was a federal employee vested with federal police powers, and lying to a federal employee was generally not a good idea. I kept my mouth shut until we got to the Park headquarters in Twentynine Palms. 

When I told my story to the head ranger, however, his eyes flickered with recognition. He cut me short after I mentioned the two pinpoints of light in the darkness and, with a quick and ominous look to the ranger who had found me at Carey’s Castle, dismissed my citation. The ranger and I shared a tense silence as he drove me back to my car at Skull Rock. I was in shock . The flood the night before had completely changed the topography of the canyons below me, and I don’t know that I would have been able to find my way back had I tried to navigate them in the morning.

I had already carried a deep and abiding respect for the terrors of the desert before that day, but now I know that that respect did not run deep enough. I didn’t take the desert seriously enough and almost died in a flash flood, to say nothing of the terrifying encounter I had with that thing that night. I still don’t know what it was, or what intentions it had towards me. Let my experience be a reminder to you to take nature very seriously - and even more so the things it hides just beyond our view in the dark.

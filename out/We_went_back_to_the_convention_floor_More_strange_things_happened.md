This was just last night, July 1st. We had just got out of the new Elvis movie. And low and behold, we decided to go back to the convention floor. So when we got there, the escalator that led to the floor was down and blocked off. So we had to take the elevator. We got there, and one of my buddies mentioned that he had found a new spot to explore on his own the other night. We followed him through the whole mess of hallways and rooms, and suddenly found ourselves in an abandoned restaurant. Tables and chairs were stacked all over the place. It was dead quiet, and just gave off a weird vibe. 

We walked through, and we’re just kinda standing there when me and one of the guys talked (the other two had gone down some stairs and were exploring the actual restaurant), when he suddenly threw his hand up in the typical “be quiet” signal. I immediately shut up and listened with him. He kept his hand up and peeked around a corner. I suddenly heard a loud voice, and the door around the corner briefly shook. He took off. I turned around to let my buddies know, but when I didn’t see them, I knew I had to make the split second decision to just take off and hope they follow us out. We knew weren’t doing anything wrong, but we were just worried that a bitchy security guard could ruin the fun of it. So me and this one friend ran all the way back to a small room with a stage (the same room where I had seen the shadow our second time here). We waited, and then walked back out to the main hallway. We stood there waiting, worried that some security guard or something had stopped them. We waited and waited. After about 3 minutes, we heard voices start to come through the room and approach the door. However, this didn’t sound like THEIR voices. It was like the ones I had heard the first time we came here. Heavy and angry. The voices started to come up the stairs toward the door, but as they got closer they got quieter and more raspy. My buddy and I exchanged a confused look. He must’ve been hearing these different voices too. They stopped at the door. We both waited. It felt like a horror movie scene. I slowly started to step back from the door. He barley touched the handle, but the door suddenly flew open. 

Sure enough, it was our buddies. They hadn’t heard what we heard, and I guess just calmly walked back to us. We all talked about what had happened as we went back to the main floor. However, we immediately decided to go into the giant room that the chandelier room leads to. There were many chairs in it this time, meaning there was probably an event recently. We goofed off in this room for a bit, doing fake vulgar speeches on the stage and such. We were on the stage when all of the sudden one of my friends pointed toward the door that led to the kitchen and took off running. We followed him, and he said the lights just suddenly flicked on. Again, it was more about getting in trouble than anything paranormal. Although I haven’t told my friends, I definitely sense a paranormal presence there. 

I was walking back toward the main floor while the rest of my friends went back. I was going back just to answer a text message. I was walking through when I briefly glanced to my right at an employee hallway. In that split second, I saw a shadow shoot down the hallway in the direction of my friends. It had no shape or anything, it was just a pure shadow. I immediately booked it out onto the main floor and waited for my friends, even texting one of them “FUCK THAT MAN. HELL NAH. LET’S GET THE FUCK OUTTA HERE.” They came out and we talked. At that point, we decided it was done, and we headed back down, as our curfews were coming up and we had to leave. This place is fun to explore and it’s for sure interesting, but I sense a paranormal presence there and always feel off. Maybe we’ll go back, and if we do, I’ll be sharing updates.

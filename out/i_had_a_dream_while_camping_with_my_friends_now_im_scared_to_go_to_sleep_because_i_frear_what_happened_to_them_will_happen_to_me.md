  

Hi, my name is Andrew, and this is my horrifying story of what happened to me and my friends. Though its not a story and its still going on to this day.

It was a cold winter night. Not the best time to go camping but me and a few friends decided that it would be a great idea to go out into the forest at night during winter, how stupid of an idea it was. Well, when we decided to go out that night, it was a great idea at the time, not so much now. We wanted to go camping during winter due to most animals and bugs being in hibernation so there would be little annoyance, and that when we woke up, we would be able to have a snowball fight, too bad that most of us didn’t wake up. 

There where 10 of us, we split into 5 teams, two per tent. We fought it would be a good idea to split up so we could cover more territory. But instead, it only made it easier to be picked off one by one, or should I say two by two. 

So, when we arrived at the forest and we got our tents up, we made a campfire in the centre of all our tents so we could talk by the campfire and tell cheesy stories that where ment to be scary, somewhere while others where just badly written creepypastas, like the “jeff the killer” story and the “Slenderman” story. Y’know, those cheesy stories from 2016 that somehow scared the shit out of everyone, including me. I think my story was the best though but I’m not going to get into it to save your time, though I did post it on reddit.

When night came, we put out the campfire and went to sleep. Big mistake. probably the worst mistake in my life. During when we where sleeping, we all experienced the same dream, and we can all remember it to its fullest extent. Each detail. The dream went like this; 

We all woke up in this long, dark hallway. The walls were made entirely up of rusted pipes with some places, gas was leaking out. What confused me the most is that we woke up tied with the person we were sleeping with in our tents. The hallway itself seemed to go on forever, with no visible ends or exits.

“Yo where the fuck are we.” I said to everyone there.

“I dunno dude.” Said kyle, responding to me. Kyle was the other person in my group, we where both tied together with a rope that was quite easy to untie. 

After everyone woke up and untied themselves, we tried to thigure out where we were. Which was impossible since we couldn’t hear each other. The only person we could hear was the person we were tied too originally. So, we all unanimously decided to try and spell out what we were saying my drawing the letters in the air with our fingers. Which worked and we all decided we would go split up into to go down each side of the hallway. Me, kyle and 3 others went down one side while the 5 overs went down the other side. We did this so one team could split between each side so we could communicate to each other if one side found an exit. This was probably the only smart decision we made. 

4 hours later and we still didn’t find any exit, we probably walked for miles at that point, so we decided to stop and take a break. But right when we stopped, we heard an ungodly scream, a scream that wasn’t natural, it was inhumane. So, we did the logical thing and got up and ran, the scream came from where the others went so, we knew that each of them where either dead or being chased by something. This was later confirmed 30 minutes later by the extremely loud chewing sound that came from over where they were. 

We ran for about 3 more hours when we fell through the floor and woke up from that dream. And right when we woke up, we heard someone scream. And instead of running away like we did in our dream, we went to investigate. The scream came from toby who woke up next to the severely mangled body of albert who was still alive but unable to wake up (they were in group 5, me and kyle where in group 4). So, we knew what happened in that dream was either real or had some affect on our reality, this was confirmed when we checked on group 1 and 2, they where in the same position as albert. We did the logical thing and called 999, the paramedics arrived shortly after and took them away to the nearest hospital. The remaining 5 of us went to a police station to be questioned and then where set free to go. I went back to my apartment complex with kyle. I decided to write up on what happened. Then I went to sleep 3 hours after.

The dream happened again but this time, I was alone. So, I remembered what happened last time so I emedietly untied myself and started running down the hallway again, this time I seen it. The thing that hurt the others, so my stupid self decided to fight the thing head on. The thing looked like a fucking monster, it was a massive spider with instead of a normal spider’s mouth, it had row and rows of extremely sharp teeth that with one bite, could tear through anything. It was about 8 feet in hight and about 16 in length and it had white leathery skin, the skin wasn’t very tough though, I could tear right through it with my nails, but that wasn’t the problem with fighting this thing, it was that its blood was boiling hot, about 115C hot, it burnt my hand so much that I couldn’t even move it without it hurting. So, I fled with it till chasing me, luckily it wasn’t fast so after a few hours of running, it was out of sight. But I kept running for what felt like days until I fell through the floor and woke up. 

When I woke up, my hand was fine though it was still hurting a bit. Kyle was on the couch sleeping, probably going through that dream, so I woke him up. 

“Dude, I had that dream again, Y’know the one with the hallway, that one” kyle said to me as he woke up

“I did too” I responded to him with

We decided it would be a good idea to share this entire story to reddit which brings me to now, I’m really scared to go to sleep now because I don’t want what happened to them to happen to me, I barely escaped the two other times but I feel like I won’t this time but if I do, I hope I don’t have that dream again but if I do, ill keep you updated. So, let’s hope that I don’t die. Well, cya tomorrow, I guess.

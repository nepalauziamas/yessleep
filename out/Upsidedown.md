Upside-down.

Last night I woke up at 4:25 to find my life had been turned upside-down. To give you a bit of background,  I (Female) Moved into my first apartment with my best friend All (also Female). We met up in the gaeltach (a place like school for 2-3 weeks of summer where you can live with other people and do alot of activities while learning irish). 

We have been best friends since then ( 8 years ago!) 

When we met, she introduced me to her little sister, Carla.

Carla was a sweetheart. 
Carla liked playing with hot wheels and sylvanians. 
All never got on with Carla.
She hated having her social life stripped from her at a young age as she had to mind Carla.

So I stood up.
Every Saturday I'd take Carla and Bex (their dog.) On a walk down around their estate.
Then I'd lock her dog back into the house so I could walk her down to the cinema and to get Mc Donald's.

Carla loved Mc Donald's.

I basically raised Carla since her mother passed. She was only 6 at the time.
Her mother was a single mother and her sister was only still 16 so I stood up. I was 15 but managed to get her out of foster care ( she had panic attacks around any strangers.) The only time she was calm was the Saturdays I would take her out on.

Carla, All and Bex all stayed at my house.
Bex and my dog Ham got on great. Until they had pups. A golden retriever and boxer mix.
Unfortunately, most if the pups were still born. The two that survived were Charlie and Buddy.

But I'm getting off topic.
I decided it would be better for all of us if Carla came to my apartment. She was 12 and moody and my parents are not getting any younger so I decided to step up.

Last night, or this morning, I was abruptly woken to banging on my front door. It must have woken Carla up aswell.

I scampered to the front door to find police already inside the apartment and my door now on the floor.

I wiped my hand over my eyes as it was so so blurry but then I was tackled to the ground. I don't remember much after that except crying.

I was at a loss for words.
I simply can't believe All killed Carla.
I am even more fearful at the fact that she was still on the run.

I say was as the way the recoding states, Carla was face timing her best friend when she was asked what was behind her. A face through the window glanced back at her.

Then she broke through the window and stabbed her. Her friend was in Switzerland and couldn't do much so called 999.

I say was as I can now, ever so vividly,  see her through the window. The same cold stare the doctors and police gave me as they asked where I stored my medicine.

I do not understand why the want to see my medication,  I did not do it. Until I did.

It all came crashing down when I realised,  my bedroom does not connect to the front door, Carla's does.

It wasn't All the police were looking for, it was me.

It isn't All outside the window, It's Carla...

I was on YouTube listening to one of my favorite channels “Mr Gray Reads” I just love how soothing his voice is telling these scary stories. I’d just made it home from work glad to be away from there and the disheveled customer that seems to come up there everyday.

My brother had just left stating he’d return later. About 15 minutes later I was in my kitchen just finished washing dishes YouTube still in the background when I heard the door open and close and my brother ascend the stairs and close the door to his room.

I made my way upstairs to my room after shutting my laptop off to get ready for bed. I decided to take a quick shower before jumping in bed. As I was brushing my teeth I could’ve sworn I saw the door to the bathroom crack open but when I turned to look it was still closed. I finished up and went to bed.

I couldn’t have been asleep more than an hour when I heard footsteps coming down the hall and stop at my door.  My brother has been coming to check in on me every night for the past few weeks since I told him about the creep at work. He walked back into his room and I drifted off to sleep.

My alarm went off around 6:30am. Did my morning hygiene routine and got ready to head to work. I went to eat a quick breakfast and wait for my brother since he’s appointed himself to be my chauffeur. “You don’t have to keep checking on me every night I’m sure there are no monsters under my bed,”I joked. “What are you talking about?” He asked. “I’m talking about how you’ve been coming to my room every night for the past few weeks” I responded.

I watched as his face scrunched up in confusion and back to his usual poker face. “How long has it been again” he asked. Since the month started” I responded, “I think I need to refresh the security app it didn’t even notify me when you went out the door my last one was when you came home last night” I said while glancing at my phone confused. It usually alerts any time a door or window opens.

“Well are you ready to go” he asked dismissing the subject. “Yea” I responded. I was shocked to hear my phone chime as I opened the door. He kept quiet as we walked out to the car I locked the door behind us glancing up at my room. I could’ve sworn I left my light on I thought to myself. “What’s eating you”? I asked my brother as we made it to the stop sign. “Ren, call Brian ”, he calmly said. Instantly I was on edge he only calls me Ren when somethings wrong. 

Without question I called Brian, my brothers  partner at the police station. “Yo what’s up Renny Ren” I smiled at the nickname only for my smile to disappear with my brothers next words. “Bri, call cap and tell him I need unmarked cars at the house now, no lights no sirens”. I looked at him in confusion, “ I think there’s an intruder “. 

I didn’t even realize we’d stopped around the corner from the house. My brother then turned to me, “Ren I’ve been staying at Nessa’s house this whole month I only come to pick you up and drop you off” I looked at him still confused until realization hit me. Someone else has been in that house with me.

I was now sitting at the station in a daze until I heard my brothers voice. “Why tf were you in my house watching my little sister” he yelled. My head shot up and met the eyes of the most terrifying looking man: long unkempt hair and beard, dead looking eyes, with a menacing grin. I gasped as I realized it was the same man that comes to my job everyday.

“I wanted to make her mine but she turned me down every time I stopped by her job” he started, “I got tired of waiting and decided if I can’t have her nobody will”.
“Then why creep around the house and watch me sleep this whole month?” I timidly asked. “I was waiting for my birthday…. That was going to be my present to myself if we couldn’t be together in life we’d be together in death “ he responded.

The last thing he said to me before they ushered him off made me shudder, “Sucks to get arrested on your birthday “, he stated, “I was really looking forward to celebrating later.”

Later I found out he had rope and an assortment of items used to torture a person stashed in my brothers room where he’d been staying I always find myself wondering what would’ve happened had I not mentioned my brothers nightly check ins. 

It’s been a year now and I’ve been doing great. My brother just got back from his vacation that took me 2 months to convince him to take. I keep telling him to buy a new suitcase I think to myself as I hear him drag it to his room. I glance down at my phone chuckling as I answer, “Why are you calling me from upstairs are you that tired?” I asked my brother. There was a brief pause before he responded, “Can you go see if my package got delivered next door to the Mitchell’s house?” He asked. “Sure I responded happily. I heard his room door open as I closed the door to the house. 

He stayed on the phone with me until he heard Mr. Mitchell open the door. “Give him the phone for me please Ren”, my brother said. “Of course bud no problem”, said Mr.Mitchell before he ended the call. I reached for my phone when he instead ushered me in and quickly shut the door. “Serenity your brothers flight got delayed he’s on his way from the airport now.” He paused to give me time to process what he’d said before continuing, “Your stalker was just released this morning.” I instantly went to the camera app we’d gotten installed after the incident…there he was standing behind the door knife in hand waiting for me to walk through the door.

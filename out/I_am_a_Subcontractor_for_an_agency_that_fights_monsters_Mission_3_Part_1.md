Part 1

Hanson gave me a couple of days of well needed rest. The last mission had taken it’s toll but luckily I made a full recovery curtsey of the SDF healing potions. These had vastly improved over the years, the difference was very much noticeable. The stuff we had back when I was a ranger was less than half as effective.

Nostalgia aside, it was time to get to work. In the early hours of the morning I noticed the arrival of two SDF C-2 Greyhound Transports where a platoon of soldiers emerged from each one, they were shortly followed by an AH-64 Apache attack helicopter piloted by Major John Reins. A member of the Ranger Unit and former student of mine.

I sort of guessed my much needed rest was going to be short lived as the planes had been refuelled and serviced in a fast and efficient manner.

An uneasy feeling erupted in the dark corners of my gut, I knew something wasn’t right where they were sending us. The last time this amount of SDF resources were gathered an entire town in the Arizona wilderness had been overrun by an army of demons, not something I wanted to be dealing with considering what I had seen on the last two missions.

As I speculated, within the hour I was summoned to a meeting room. I was greeted by Colonel Stanley Hanson, Major John Reins, Captain Ariyya Al-Hussain and a man I didn't recognise, he wore Admirals attire so I assumed he was most likely the most important person in the room. I saluted the admiral and Hanson before locking gazes with Reins.

‘What? Don’t I get anything?’ Reins smirked as I refused to salute him.

‘I think I’ll pass on that, squirt.’ I replied before finally turning to Ariyya and nodding who was rather happy to see me again. She was sort of the “favourite child” out of the two.

‘I knew you wouldn't pass the opportunity to get the old crew back together.’ She grinned.

‘You know me, cant give up on an opportunity to make some cash.’ I replied taking a seat at the standard issue plastic boardroom table before I turned to Reins and added ‘I seen you fly in earlier on, how you been these last few years?’ I reminisced the day he started out in the SDF. A good kid but always had a knack for getting in to trouble for doing something stupid. His invaluable knowledge of rune magic and supernatural creatures was the only thing that prevented him from getting the boot but overall his funny antics gave the entire unit something to laugh over.

‘Well It’s been boring without you. I miss them old days, there’s so much I need to... fill you in with.’ He said glancing at Hanson who gave him a disproving look.

‘Trust me, you don’t want to know what he did a few months back.’ Ariyya interrupted.

‘Enough of that. That was a classified mission. Come on, we don’t have much time and the Admiral here has another meeting before you all head out.’ Hanson, my former teacher, ordered.

‘Alright,’ I agreed before waited for him to start..

Hanson cleared his throat, ‘I’ve gathered you all here because a situation has developed off the coast off Japan. We have been liaising with the CIA over the last few months about the organisation that was behind them illegal experiments that McCarthy stumbled upon on his first mission back, working for that Brit. We’ve been handed information to suggest they have another facility off the coast of Japan where they are potentially developing something far more powerful than what we have previously engaged. This kind of thing has the ability to spell an international disaster once again. Some of the details are a bit hazy due to the fact this mysterious organisation has immensely ramped up it’s security to the point now where it’s almost airtight. We have enough evidence now and backing from our allies to make a move and see exactly what they’ve been up to. The US Department of Defence has tasked us with eliminating the threat and securing any biological weapons they may have developed. The Admiral here will provide us with a Carrier Strike Group and Navy personnel to aid us and give us a base of operations whilst we investigate this new facility.’ He pressed a few buttons on a controller, a small TV screen displayed maps and diagrams of the facility that had been gathered from satellite imagery over a period of time.

‘Alright,’ I sighed. ‘Do we know what kind of enemies we’ll be facing or will it be one of them find out on the job missions again?’ I asked as I wasn’t a massive fan of surprises considering what we faced in the last mission.

‘As I said the information is a bit hazy. If this mission is going to be anything like your last then I think we’re all certain you’ll encounter formidable enemies. At least this time round you have the full support of the SDF and the US Navy in case things go sideways... again’ Hanson replied closing a small diary on his table.

‘Sounds fun.’ I replied sarcastically, ‘So I’m assuming Tamuramoro will be leading this mission from the SDF perspective?’ I asked as I knew Tam had been running the SDF operations in Asia for the last thirty years. I had worked with him in a past on a few missions when I had first started out in the SDF but our contact had been very limited to say the least. I personally had wished I had more time to learn from him. He was considered the best swordsman in the whole company, even better than Hanson and the General.

‘Tamuramoro will be leading the SDF forces and working closely with the Admiral who will be naturally in charge of the Carrier strike group. The DOD and CIA will be closely monitoring the situation so it’s not like you can randomly call in Air strikes like that last time.’ Hanson finished staring at Reins.

Reins nodded his head slightly embarrassed, ‘I swear, that was nothing to do with me.’

‘I cant believe you actually did that.’ I chuckled under my breath as that was something  definitely only Reins was capable of achieving. I turned to face Hanson, ‘So… What’s my position going to be in all of this?’

‘Tamuramoro needs someone sensible like yourself to be his second in command whilst we’re on the mission. I have reinstated your rank in the SDF and promoted you to Lieutenant Colonel.’ He revealed a multi-page booklet and tossed to my side of the table, ‘Your previous contract with us has also been reinstated and you’ve been given permission to operate as a sub-contractor for the SDF by the General.’

I carefully looked through the document and signed it in the appropriate places. ‘Alright, when do we set off?’ I asked.

‘You have thirty minutes to get in to your gear. Reins and Al-Hussain will take you to the armoury where you’ll prepare your equipment for the mission. I wish you all the best and godspeed.’ Hanson finished before gathering his things and leaving with the Admiral.

Reins and Al-Hussain escorted me to the armoury where I met up with some of the SDF research team and Sphere who had made itself at home in the engineering lab, apparently it had helped develop some new tech for the Ranger Unit which we were going to try out for the first time. In addition to the updated battle-suits I was given a one of a kind new prototype wrist mounted PDA which had the ability to send communications back to the SDF HQ and connect to the internet no matter where I was situated. Apparently it used some kind of a sub-space signal. I personally think Sphere just wanted to keep in contact with me seen as though we had formed a strong bond during the last mission.

Without wasting too much time we jumped in the battle-suits and equipped our favourite load-outs with as much ammunition as we could carry. The back-packs we were given were stuffed full of supplies as if they were expecting this mission to last a long time.

Within the hour we were hauled to the deck of an aircraft carrier, both the C-2’s and the Apache had been transferred. A few other ships joined us before we set off.

The fleet now consisted of the aircraft carrier, two guided missile destroyers, a nuclear submarine and a supply ship. Once final checks were complete we departed for Tokyo, Japan. Colonel Tam and his team promptly joined us on another C-2 and after a quick greeting we were on our way to to a part of the pacific ocean known as the Devils Sea.

We anchored about 12 miles away from the islands shore. Luckily, a plume of thick mist helped to maintain our cover from any wary eyes or cameras.

The Admiral ordered a covert UAV to be sent out to get the lay of the land before we headed out. The images we received back were not exactly too good due to the mist but at least we knew where the best place was to land. We were given the all clear by Colonel Tam and the Admiral to proceed with the operation.

I decided to keep the initial team small and call in more support later on if it was needed but for now I thought it was best to keep the initial team small until we knew more about the island and what we were facing up against.

A quarter of an hour later we made landfall upon the golden shores north of the island on a small Landing Craft Air Cushion. I was joined by Ariyya, Reins, a platoon of SDF regulars and two members of the US Navy who captained the hovercraft.

I ordered the platoon to stay put and do their best to hide the craft whilst we, the rangers, scoped out the area.

Ariyya unsheathed one of her swords and began hacking away at the vines and bushes, clearing a path for us. She always did prefer leading the way no matter how dangerous the mission was.

‘I hope you’ve got some insect repellent.’ Reins said as we trudged though the boundary where the forest began. ‘I fricking hate mosquitoes.’

‘I thought you was the expert in all things magic. I’m sure there’s something you could use to repel them?’ Ariyya asked swinging her gleaming fire infused blade.

‘You concentrate on not starting any wildfires, alright. Besides I don’t think mosquitoes fall in to the category of “supernatural creature”.’ Reins replied reaching in to a small pocket in to the side of his back pack. ‘Ah, there it is.’ Before generously applying it all over his torso.

‘The only thing that’s going to do is attract more creatures towards you.’ I said giving him a disproving nod, ‘Don’t you remember anything I thought you?’

Apart from the occasional dad lecture from me these two always bickered like brother and sister. Ever since I left the unit all those years ago I missed these two the most.

All of a sudden, Ariyya stopped in her tracks and lifted her hand to signal us to stop. Reins and I readied our weapons and crouched before creeping forward to join her near a small bush which was the boundary leading to a small open area in the forest. It had been cleared some time ago from the remains of tree stumps that littered the area.

‘What is it?’ I whispered, trying my best not to break cover.

‘Something’s not right.’ She replied looking around the clearing.

‘Yeah, I can tell. The area has been cleared by someone. Why did you stop?’ I enquired also looking around.

‘Have you noticed there is no wildlife here?’ She asked.

I looked around and so far I hadn’t seen any. 'You’re right. We should have heard or seen something by now but there’s been nothing. Normally when this happens there is something unnatural lurking around.’

Reins crouched forward, ‘You mean something like the predator? By the looks of it someone tried to copy Arnie’s trap.’ He grinned. I had no idea how he had the time to watch movies in this job especially.

Me and Ariyya both gave him the look. ‘I swear to god Reins if you jinx this one the monster will be the last thing hunting you down. Why don’t you be a macho man and do the honours.’ I ordered.

‘What?’ He objected. ‘I thought we were a team, aren't we supposed to be doing this together?’

‘Just get on with it, I have full... confidence in your abilities besides someone's going to have to take one for the team.’ I replied tapping his shoulder. He frowned, nodded his head in disapproval and began crawling through the shrubs.

Ariyya sheathed her blade and readied her rifle whilst I flicked my safety off. Reins slowly stood up and tip-toed towards the centre of the clearing. He scanned the area through the lens of his scope to no avail. There was nothing, not even the slightest sign of anything. After a few minutes of looking around he gave us the all clear to join him.

‘Looks like there’s nothing here.’ Reins shrugged resting his rifle.

‘Alright.’  I said, ‘with the coast clear let’s look around and see if we can find this mysterious facility that’s around here somewhere.’ I pulled up an aerial map of the island on my PDA to see if I could make sense of the topography and figure out where it could be situated that was when a strange sound erupted from a pile of dried shrubs. The three of us turned around and crouched with our rifles drawn. A strange looking furry blob twitched atop the pile. ‘What’s that?’ I asked in disbelief.

‘Looks like a cute furball if you ask me.’ Reins replied moving closer to the unnatural creature. ‘Would you look at that?’ He dropped his weapon and moved his arm closer to pat it, ‘Aww, come here you little cute...-’

‘REINS, GET BACK!’ I tried to warn him but it was already too late. The leaves had dispersed in all directions like confetti. A tall thick body had emerged, its oddly shaped hands had bear like talons, it’s furry cute face had transformed in to what I can best describe as a sharks head with a set of elongated razor sharp teeth that resembled the jagged edge of a handsaw. It reached out to slash Reins who had thankfully landed a few feet back on his backside and avoided severe lacerations.

Like a bolt of lightening Ariyya raised her rifle and got a few shots off, every bullet hit it’s mark and stunned the creature for a moment, giving Reins enough time to crawl back out of the way. We all unloaded a hail of bullets in to the creature but they seemed not to do much in terms of damage. Without asking Ariyya dropped her rifle and unsheathed her enchanted short-swords and began the dance of death. Within moments the creatures head rolled in to the shrubs and it’s body smacked the dirt.

‘Are you happy now?’ I asked turning to Reins.

‘What the fuck was that?’ Reins asked still visibly shaking, tapping the dirt off his battle-suit.

‘I’m not sure, let’s find out more.’ I replied giving him a helping hand off his ass.

‘...nevermind. Let’s go check this thing out.’ We observed the creature and got as much information down in the PDA’s as possible in case another member of the SDF faced off against another such creature. Strangely enough I noticed something peculiar a small electronic device which was lodged deep within it’s spine. I removed it with my combat knife and observed it for a moment. It was some sort of man made tracking chip.

Ariyya moved in for a closer look, ‘Looks like this creature was a science experiment. Didn’t you encounter genetically modified creatures awhile back?’

‘Yeah but they weren't as modified as whatever this thing was. They’re getting smarter and are starting to use tactic’s that nearly got this clown over there killed.’ I pointed at Reins who gave me the not impressed look.

‘It looks like were in for a whole load of more surprises. I don’t like this at all. The last time my team nearly got wiped out. We need to be careful going forward, so no trying to pet anything.’ I finished giving Reins the look.

The loud sound of a siren erupted in the distance and we took cover behind some shrubs once again.

‘What’s that?’ Aiyya asked.

‘I think it might be connected to the death of that creature. We need to be very careful. They might know we are here now. This could turn in to a shit show.’

The siren lasted for five minutes before cutting off, we checked to see if the coast was clear before calling HQ and relaying the situation [report.](https://www.reddit.com/user/Aqibali1993/comments/ety91p/aqib_ali_list_of_stories/)

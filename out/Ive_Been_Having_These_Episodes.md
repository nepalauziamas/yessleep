All my life, I've never had anything like this happen. Except for a little while last year. Let me explain. About two weeks ago, I was sitting in my classroom. It was 8th period, so I would leave soon. We were taking a test. Of course, once I finished, I decided to write a story in my notebook whilst everyone else finished up. I don't remember what the story was about specifically, but I know the main topic was about how your life will go by too fast if you don't live up to what you want to be. I included a paragraph about my dad who is now deceased. He had a lot of potential, however, decided to drink and do drugs which caused him to pass away in his thirties.

I was still writing, when my best friend from kindergarten (who was sitting across from me) asked me to barrow a colored pencil I had. I told her she could. All was going well. When everyone was pretty much done and there was only a few kids who were still testing, I looked up at my friend, (we will call her Emma) and her face seemed eerily similar. You might be thinking "well obviously, you've known her since kindergarten." But it wasn't like that. It was almost like her face was distorted, but I couldn't tell what exactly was different. It felt like Deja Vu. I was hit with this sudden wave of images in my head. Things from my childhood and things that never happened. (Or at least hadn't happened YET.)

There were also sounds I could hear. The most defined sound was the off-tune playing of recorders and singing of "hot crossed buns." I knew exactly what this was from. When I was in elementary school, we'd have recorder concerts. One of the first songs we learned was hot crossed buns. I had this metallic taste in my mouth. I was dizzy, confused, nauseous. I had a stomach ache that was brought on extremely fast. I was almost too aware of the fact that I was alive. (If that even makes sense.) When the episode subsided for the most part, I was still very aware of being alive, and had a soft stomach ache still. When that went away, I was left with a feeling of calmness. Creepy calmness.

Might I mention that these episodes only last about a minute or so. When they end, I can't remember what I was doing in the "physical world" at all. I can remember what I saw, heard, and felt in the images and sounds, but can't remember what was said to me by other people in real life, what happened in real life, etc. It's extremely hard to explain. These episodes happen anywhere from 2-5 times a day. This will go on for weeks about once a year, and then they will suddenly stop.

Does anyone have any clue what this could possibly be? I'm at a loss and no one seems to understand.

I posted awhile back in this Sub about my dream in which I felt I had crossed realities or timelines and when I woke nothing really felt the same. I felt compelled to start stories about the many wild dreams I've had, but one of the most recent dreams I had led me down a weird road...

I've recently been taking medication to help cope with quite a few things in my life. The upside is that it works well in managing my anxiety and allowing me to focus on other things, but the downside is my dreams feel like their "bleeding" into reality.

(Wednesday May 25th, 2022) Two days ago I dreamt I was searching for jobs online but all the listings on every website were blank. Out of frustration, I then decided to poke around Craigslist "Jobs" section and looked at anything they had available. The only available job I found was for inexperienced writers. The title read:

*"No experience needed just an open mind and willingness to listen"* 

So I clicked it. There was only one line saying: "Click here."

So I did and it led me to a page that had giant white letters on a back background that said "IMMORTALS" . Shortly after I woke up to my dogs moving around on the bed. I did my usual daily routine but in the back of my head I kept thinking about my dream.

(Thursday May 26th) 6:45a.m. I get a call from my floor manager at the factory letting me know that our company had just been bought out and the factory was being closed in 60 days. Everyone gets a month severance pay.... Except for me because I was still in my "90 day probationary period" and not a "full employee." I was beyond pissed off, but after we hung up I decided to take my dream as a hint and scroll for jobs.

I ended up on Craigslist out of curiosity and a feeling that maybe my dream had been a sort of sign. After finding a few jobs in my field and applying I decided to humor the "writing and editing" section of the "Jobs" tab. Honestly, I was hoping to see the same post from my dream, unfortunately that part of my dream remained fiction. Until I stumbled on a weird post which was titled:

*"Writer needed - open minds only"*

I got a chill, but I clicked on it and the only words in the body text were a phone number with an area code that wasn't my own or even a Texas one at that. I googled the (406) area code and it turns out to be the entire state of Montana's only area code. I did a reverse number look up thinking it was maybe a business. Nothing. Against my better judgement I called and a gruff older man answered:

Man: "You saw my post online, huh?

Me: "Yessir, but I kinda called out of curiosity. I thought it was some sort of prank, fake listing or troll. I also noticed you have a Montana area code."

Man: "It's not fake and I'll pay you for your time, but I need to speak to you in person as it's something I can't really explain over the phone. Yea, it's called a cell phone, bud. I bought it before I left the state."

Me: "Follow up question: if this involves writing why couldn't I just do it via email?"

Man: "I have a severe case of arthritis and writing isn't the easiest thing for me to do, so I'm going to relay information to you in person and I'll need you to write it or type it, but I cannot do it over the phone."

Me: "Okay, fair. Do you have a name?"

Man: "Just called me Davis."

Davis then gave me the address to an outdoor food truck not far from where I live offering me a snippet of information. He said if I felt uncomfortable or worried I was more than free to leave and since it was a public location it's not like he could stop me without drawing attention.

*This is where things get a bit scary for me*

So yesterday I met with him at 11:19a.m and we sat down to talk over some street tacos. Davis asks me if I believe in the nefarious acts of hidden organizations to which I reply *"maybe, but if there's no proof then nobody tends to believe such things."*

He goes on to tell me that he's currently 68 years old, but when he was 65 and living in Havre, Montana when he applied to an online listing for a paid experimental medical study for people with arthritis. Given the economy and his dwindling savings he decided he would give it a shot. Just 2 days after applying to the medical study he received a letter via mail that said he was accepted into the program with an address that was in a rural area called Oakdale, North Dakota - a 7 hour drive he commented was "the most boring shit he's ever done."

He arrived on a small country road where his GPS led him to a small warehouse labeled "C.S.S Pharmaceuticals" in big blue print. He arrived at a gate where he showed his I.D. and the acceptance letter and was ushered in. I then stopped him to ask:

Me: "Do you have this letter still?"

Man: "No, the gate guard confiscated it from me and handed me a visitors badge."

Me: "That's kind of convenient for a conspiracy story."

Man: "Are you going to fucking listen or not? I'm only giving you a snippet of information. If you don't want to believe me, I'll just leave."

I apologized and decided to listen. He went on to explain how he sat in the waiting room of this beautifully designed clinic, but that it didn't give off the vibe of a standard medical facility. There were no TV's, the floor was cement instead of the polished white tile, and as he walked up to check-in he noticed the receptionist didn't even have a computer. 

It was only minutes after he checked in that he was called back through a plain white door to his left. He followed a nurse dressed in all white to a room where he was weighed, a blood sample was taken and his mouth swabbed. During this time the nurse said nothing and asked him no questions.

Davis interrupted his own story as his phone rang. He answered, made a weird face, and hung up without saying a word.

Davis: "I have to go."

Me: "What? Now? It was getting good."

Davis: "Your idea of 'good' is far from mine. It gets worse, buddy. I have your phone number. I'll call you."

Before I could say a word he popped open the phone, took the SIM card and battery out, and tossed it in the trash.

Davis: "One word, bud: *immortals*. They kidnapped me and others and they'll keep doing it. Makes no sense now, but it will later. I'll reach out" and then rushed off.

All yesterday I was deeply confused, worried, and a bit scared. Either this man is deeply off his rocker and the whole "immortals" thing is a massive coincidence or my dreams have yet again shown me something...

(Friday May 27, 2022 - today) He called at 7:32am from a new number and wants to meet today. I don't know if I should. I don't know if this will be a waste of time or an opportunity to learn something, but I think I'm going to meet him and agree to write this story....

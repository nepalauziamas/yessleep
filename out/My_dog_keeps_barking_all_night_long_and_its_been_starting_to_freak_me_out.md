At first I thought my dog was just being annoying however this would go one for weeks and months and hasn’t stopped since. I’ve recently started realizing these aren’t any normal barks they are vicious growls. Me 19M and my dog 13M live in a small cabin in Indiana on the edge of a forest and my barking dog started happening shortly after my girlfriend moved in with me 20F. She always played with terot cards. Like a lot to the point it was a occupation that took a sum of her day. If you don’t know what terot cards are they basically can read you using spirits and learn things about you that it tells the reader. Although never believing in spirits they knew quite a bit about me. For example would say how I have a fear of loosing my closest family member as my only fear (my mom) I kept it in the back of my head as a coincidence not knowing what would happen next 



After these cards were introduced into my house there has been a strange aura making everything negative my gf and I often fight and things have been off. And this is where it started my dog started barking at air and would be scared of entering my loft. I never thought much of it as my girlfriend just does readings there but boy was I wrong 



I came to my loft at 13:48 AM to see what the issue was and I saw my dog barking at a wall I scolded him and went to bed. It got serious after him keeping this up for another 2 weeks and I saw my girlfriend corps completely covered in blood lying on the cold hardwood floor. I in shock stood there as lights slowly flickered and took my dog and drove to my mothers house. After telling her everything suggests burning the cards so I tried. Accept one major issue accrued they didn’t burn. They were normal playing card texture and material just didn’t burn but instead exploded in my fire place quickly having to put out the fire my lights started flicker and my lamps started floating and what I saw next made me fear for my life



My dog was dead bloody corpse completely dismantled couldn’t even tell it was a dog was horrifying I saw a large being emerge from the fire place probably around 14 feet tall with a head with 7 eyes and a turquoise necklace and it spoke to me however I couldn’t understand what it said as I had to flee fast the only issue was I think I am the only one to see it I was driving to my moms house when it was on top of my convertible mustang it  clawed a whole through my car and left a long scratch on my arm but as soon as I approached my mothers house and saw my mother it disappeared until I found out things couldn’t get any worse. 




I went into my moms room to explain everything but what I saw horrified me. The same turquoise necklace on her night stand . This couldn’t be a coincidence it why would she do this to her only family member I wish I knew. I had to devise a plan and got to thinking she never used silverware but plastic ware I thought a silver knife could be her kryptonite so I decided at 12:00 AM I was going to kill her but things took a turn for the worse before I acted like I was sleeping she told me something so disturbing I had to call it off and am currently fleeing the country and hiding from my mother “It Will all work out in the end” didn’t seem like much until I remembered what I hired the monster mutter and why she didn’t hug me. My pocket knife hurt her and apparently the terot cards made her into the monster she is and there is no going back I don’t know what to do can I survive will I be hunted? I don’t know but all I know for sure is I can no longer live or trust anyone again as I don’t know if it is the slender being manipulating me for whatever it wants from me

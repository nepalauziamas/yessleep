  

My mind was shut just like my mouth, unable to provide me with the answers I needed to correctly process what had just happened. My hand glued to the door handle, my legs cemented on the floor, I stood there at the entrance at two in the morning, unable to believe what I just saw. It was no longer possible to just ignore or endure. I should have listened to him. 

That traumatizing part of my life happened last year. After landing a good employment, I, Kayla, could finally realize my long-awaited dream to break free from the family cocoon and take my flight. Therefore, I wasted no time to search for an accommodation to move out of the family house with my cat Reen. 

About two weeks of searching were enough to find what I was looking for. Located in a safe area and not too far from my workplace, my heart melted for a nice and affordable one bedroom house with a small front and back yards, a small porch, and a door with a cat flap. The dream place or so I thought before the strange phenomenon began, all of them revolving around one part of the house. 

On my first day in the house, after long hours of unpacking, I ended up with some trash that I had to take out in the evening. In the process, I received a call from my mom, so I had my smartphone in one hand and a refuse bag in the other. When I passed the door, something like a glitch struck the phone and distorted my mom's voice for a second. 

I did not think much of it and went on to throw out the trash. However, as I returned to the house and passed the door, it happened again. This could not be a coincidence. Distracted by the strange occurrence, I was no longer paying attention to my mom's words, and I decided to do a little experiment. 

Smartphone now in both hands, and in front of my eyes, I went to stand right next to the door and indeed, the distortion occurred for as long as I stood there. I could hear a few understandable words until the distortion turned into static as the screen flickered. After a few seconds, the device went off, its charged battery suddenly drained. 

Hours later, I called my mom back who I knew would be worrying to sickness if I did not do so, and I explained to her everything that happened. She said that she did not hear any distortion or static sounds, instead, she heard wind blowing on the device's microphone until the call was disconnected. She blamed it on a network issue, without of course knowing how wrong she was. 

Next evening, after work, I called my boyfriend Nolan to help me set up a doorbell. Yeah, you know how it is with those first things. Whether it is a first house, a first car or even a first phone, you always want it to be as fancy as possible. He was there the day before and it was a safe area, therefore, I told him to just come in when he arrives, and I left the door unlocked. 

Waiting for him with a bowl of snack, I was comfortably seated on the couch watching a TV show when I heard someone opening the door. I turned and saw nobody at the entrance and was about to blame it on the wind. That was before I clearly saw the door handle being pressed by an invisible force. 

I lost the ability to blink at the realization that I was right in the middle of my first paranormal experience. Stranded between fear and excitement, I could not think of what to do in response to that strange phenomenon. At some point, I wanted to stand up but before I could do so, whatever was at the door slammed it shut, and I heard running footsteps outside as I let out a scream. 

Completely overwhelmed with fear, I stood up and quickly called Nolan on the phone to know how long it would take him to arrive. It rang as I trembled, hoping for him to answer my call, but he did not. I reached his voicemail about eight times while also reaching full panic mode, until he finally answered:

"Kayla?" He said, sounding freaked out. 

"Nolan?" I replied. 

"Where the hell are you?" 

"Wh—What? I'm home, I'm waiting for—" 

"Get out of that hell Kayla! Like right now!" 

"What? What you— what you talking about?" I questioned, confused about the situation. 

He took a breath and tried to explain calmly what he meant. I did not believe him. Despite the strange occurrence earlier with the door, what he then told me was too much to digest. But, for the sake of the story, I will tell you about it later and you will understand why. I managed to calm myself down and crept to the door to lock it, and since that evening it became the number one rule whether I am inside or outside. 

After around three weeks of stay, Reen developed the heartbreaking habit of just disappearing for days. Once, she was gone for so long that I had to post a missing pet alert. She would always come back, sometimes covered with a black viscous substance, then be around for a couple of hours only before disappearing again.

Meanwhile, since he could no longer set even a toe in my home, Nolan would pester me on the phone to leave that house. He kept on telling me the exact same thing, and the more he told me, the more I was determined not to move out. This could not be happening to me. Not in my first house, my own space, my dream place. I wish that I listened to him earlier. 

One day, after a long morning jog, I arrived exhausted at my door and unwilling to go inside. I took my phone out of my jogger belt and then squeezed the latter item inside the house through the cat flap along with my shoes. Under the shelter of the porch, I sat to enjoy the fresh air before going to the bathroom, finding myself surfing on the web for celebrity news. 

Following that little relaxing, I unlocked the door and opened it, expecting to find the items I squeezed inside earlier. I looked at the floor and there was nothing. With a few questions on my mind and trying to rationalize what was happening. I looked for Reen, expecting her to be the culprit, but she was not there at that moment. 

I checked the windows and the backdoor, looking for any sign of forced entry to no avail. Nobody could have taken those items away, they just vanished right there from inside the house. I stood in the middle of the house, powerless, my mind devoid of any explanation, when the phone rang. I knew it was Nolan and what he wanted to tell me again about the house, but I once again refused to recognize the signs. 

Four days after that incident, came my last night in that house, and the one I will never forget. The date was the 2nd of March 2021. At around 2 am, I was peacefully sleeping before I woke up to the sound of Reen making a little fuss in my cupboard. Stretching and yawning, I opened an eye and gasped when I saw a yellow eye glowing in the dark. 

My vision adjusted on the spot, and I could see Reen sitting still on the night table and staring at something in front of us. A sigh of relief escaped from my mouth as I was glad that Reen was back, but I quickly noticed her strange behavior. She was completely frozen in place, immobile and like hypnotized by what she was staring at. 

At that moment, I heard the noise coming from the cupboard and realized that the responsible could not be the cat. In fact, Reen was staring at the culprit. My heart exploded as it was clear that someone had broken into the house, hence, I looked in the direction of the cupboard. 

I saw something in the dark and immediately sat up, my heart violently beating in my chest. My eyes widened and my vision adjusted again, allowing me to see the nightmare that invaded my dream place. A robber would have been terrifying enough but instead, when I saw it, horror itself stopped moving and searching my cupboard, then slowly turned its head to look at me. 

Grey in color, that humanoid being as slim as a mantis with two upper limbs and two lower limbs, displayed its terrifying face only made of crawling things that resembled maggots. I screamed and jumped out of my bed, and the thing which ran on four pursued me. We reached the door almost at the same time and I turned left towards the bathroom before falling on the floor, whereas it turned right and took the direction of the entrance door. 

Black handprints appeared on the floor at each stride the creature took, as it ran towards its escape. I watched it squeeze itself through the cat flap despite its size and disappear on the other side. Still on the floor, and only hearing my heavy breath in the silence of the night, I kept my fearful eyes on the door for around two minutes, expecting the worst to come in through it. 

Pushed by I do not know what, I stood up and crept towards the door to investigate. I noticed that the creature left earlier handprints going from that door to the bedroom, confirming that it came in and escaped through the same entrance. I reached the door, took the key hanging on the wall next to it and mustered the courage to unlock. 

Hoping that the thing does not seize my leg suddenly through the cat flap, I opened the door just a bit, but enough to see the outside. I looked down and expected to see the brown colored floor of my wooden porch, but instead, I saw a dry and hard ground. The shock of that sight prompted me to open the door completely and I discovered a new world. 

There were cracks all over the hard soil which at some distance became a rocky ground. A substance, black and viscous, stained certain parts of the soil, explaining why the creature left all those black handprints behind. I believe that Reen had also been there, because of the pawprints she would sometimes leave in the house and the way she would disappear then come back all stained by something viscous and black. 

Dark hills covered with the streaming black substance matched with the daylight somber sky. Winged creatures I could tell not to be birds leisurely flew high in groups. I could not believe my own eyes. I slammed the door shut, almost convinced to have lost my mind, waited for a few seconds, then reopened it. 

I was back to the normal world, my neighborhood, with the porch, the alley, the neighboring houses, and everything. However, the porch was devoid of any black handprints that creature should have left if it really set its limbs on that floor, hence proving me that it really and fortunately went back to that world I saw. 

So, this is how I found myself standing at my entrance at two in the morning, my hand glued to the door handle, my legs cemented on the floor, unable to process what I just saw. I could no longer ignore Nolan's warnings and decided to listen to him. I used a chair to block the door and keep it open, then called Nolan and my parents to help me move out immediately.

On the way to the family house, we talked about happened in more details, and I elaborated more on what I encountered, and he was of course ready to believe me because of what he experienced himself. 

Indeed, after what Nolan saw that evening, he did research and learned about things called breaches. Rare and isolated cracks acting as opened doors to other realms or dimensions, that can just form anywhere in the world because of some imbalance. We could not explain why or how there was at least one breach that fitted right on a door. 

That evening, when Nolan arrived and opened the door, instead of seeing the normal decoration and me watching TV, all he could see was a cave with lots of holes. Almost immediately, he heard the noise of insects, hundreds of insects that started to emerge from the holes and that was the moment he closed the door and fled.

Since we were not on the same realm at that moment, and since it was still the same entrance, all I could see was the door opening then closing seemingly on its own, and all I could hear after he closed the door and somehow returned to the same realm as mine, was him running for his dear life. 

Nolan and I cooked up a top notch lie as an explanation to my sudden departure for my landlord to believe. I could not dare to tell him the truth. How could he believe such phenomenon? I felt so terrible for future tenants and went as far as to leave very negative reviews of that house on the web, to discourage anyone from buying or even renting it. 

Unfortunately, being out of that house, do not help me feel safe since those breaches can just form anywhere in the world. Think about it, how cannot you believe in other dimensions when there are strange phenomenon happening around the world? 

Think about the strange disappearances of people, or things like planes and boats, that have never been solved for example. I was very skeptical about those kinds of things before I saw what I saw. I know that if anyone could meet something or someone that do not seem to belong here, just like I did, that person would know about the breaches and dimensions, and believe their existence too. 

My cat Reen is the sole victim of everything that happened. Since then, she has never behaved like a normal cat. She rejects anything that is served in her bowl and prefers to go outside to feed on I do not know what. Also, she has never meowed once since we left that house. I just hope that she does not go back there when she is out. 

I still live in the family house till today, and now Reen just creeps out everybody unlike before. Every night, no matter where she sits, she chooses anyone in the house whether that person is sleeping or not, and with her intense, yellow, and glowing eyes, she just stares.

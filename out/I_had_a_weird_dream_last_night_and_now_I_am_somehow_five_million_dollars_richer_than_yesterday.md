**My only advice to you is that you should never close your eyes while you are in a dream, it could easily turn into an unforgettable nightmare, haunting you for the rest of your life.**

The sweat ran across my forehead as I woke up from that nightmare of a sleep. Glancing at the wall clock, the time was 6 AM, a little early for the likes of me.

Stepping out of bed to clear my head, an unusual item that  had been left by my bedside caught my eye. It was a briefcase, an Alpine Swiss Expandable Leather Attaché. I had seen it before, precisely five minutes ago.

Now, it would have been easier if I could tell myself that someone broke into the apartment, placed it there and left. But there were no signs of anyone breaking in, everything was as calm as ever. Not that it matters anyway, but how could you explain to me that the briefcase, the exact same type that I saw in my dream or rather a nightmare made its way to the real world.

*And no I am not in any twilight zone while I write about this incident, the briefcase is still there staring me in the face and inside it are unmarked bills amounting to five million dollars. I know the exact amount because ‘he’ told me about it in my nightmare.*

*Looking at the faint moonlight outside my window, I’ll try to explain to you why I keep referring to my dream as a nightmare. Most of the time, I can’t even remember what I had last night for dinner but this nightmare is vividly imprinted into my mind as if everything happened in front of my eyes. Still, there has to be an explanation.*

*Let me just try to fill you in with the details of last night and of course tell you about the nightmare that I saw.*

*I am a 27-year-old department store worker living on my own. Safe to assume my monthly earnings isn’t something that I am proud of but it gets me by in a small living space and provides for two good meals a day.*

*Usually I work the night shifts except for Friday’s and the last night happened to be a Friday night.*

Leaving the store duties to the new part timer, around eleven I was on my way to the bar to enjoy a round of drinks. That wasn’t too much to ask.

Went inside the bar, ordered a few drinks, got drunk, left with unsteady feet. Bumbling on my way out, the new part timer came to my rescue. He should’ve been at work.

I confronted him asking why he wasn't at work and his response was that the owner came in and ordered him to lock up and leave, which was odd given the owner had never done that sort of thing in all the years I’ve known him for.

The part-timer was kind enough to give me a ride in his car. He might have been doing well if he could afford a vehicle like that, given his young age, I thought to myself. 

Anyway, his financial condition was none of my concerns. I got inside the car and started to babble about the crashing economy, the grumpy store owner and other stuff I wouldn’t normally be talking about while sober. He was kind enough to listen through all my nonsense.

I remember him smiling all the way to my destination.

“Sleep tight!” Those were the last words he uttered as he drove away. I got upstairs to the bedroom, took my medication, got in bed and that was the end of my tiresome night.

*This is where the nightmare took over my sweet sleep. And yes, I don’t believe in lucid dreaming but for this one instance I am willing to make an exception.*

The initial picture is still a blur. I remember standing outside the department store I work at… Sadly the horrific images following that are still clear in my head. I will try to explain it in the best possible and understandable way I can, hoping that it all makes sense. 

No one was around, it was just me and the sky engulfing the darkness around the intersection I was standing at. I called for a taxi via the local transit service. Soon after, a limousine came to pick me up. Parking in front of the store, the chauffeur got out. He greeted me with a smile on his face and held the door open for me.

Inside, five others were already seated. Three of them on one side, two on the other. Weirdly, all of their eyes were closed for some reason, and it didn't look like they were sleeping either. I greeted them but their faces showed no emotion, they were just pale, blank with their eyes shut. It never bothered me. I didn’t know them nor did I have any interest in doing so. I just wanted to reach my destination.

What seemed like an eternity, were only a few minutes inside that uncanny vehicle. The window glass had black tint to it, making it hard  to see anything outside.

The driver paid no attention to what was going on in the back and kept driving forward, to god knows where.

The limo made a sharp turn and it was at that moment, I knew that it wasn’t going to be any ordinary ride home. The man sitting in front of me fell down to the floor with his eyes wide open. He kept screaming in pain but no one came to his rescue.

Without giving it a second thought, I yelled at the chauffeur to stop the vehicle but my request fell on deaf ears.

“No need to make a fuss about it, Just close your eyes, if you don’t want to watch him suffer,” the chauffeur yelled back.

And for some absurd reason, I believed him.

*Even though all this is a dream, I think my actions and their consequences could've been avoided if I had a little more control over my mind.* 

Sadly, I decided to play along with their rules. 

**I SHOULDN’T HAVE CLOSED MY EYES, NOW THERE IS NO TURNING BACK!**

*All this could have been avoided if I just knew how to control my mind better. Well, you don’t think of these things when you are inside your head dreaming, thinking your actions won’t have any consequences after you wake up. I was wrong, dead wrong and trouble was waiting for me around the corner.*

Recalling the still fragments lying fresh in my memory… There I was inside that limousine with five others. One of them was lying on the limo's floor mat with his eyes wide open. There was fear in his eyes, his screams had stopped as soon as I closed my eyes, just like the chauffeur had asked me to do.

My eyes were closed yet I could see everything clearly. I was inside that same limo, nothing changed but that time there were only four others besides me. All of their eyes were wide open, staring at me in disgust, like I was some kind of bane entered into their life, uninvited.

The chauffeur turned around and with that I mean he really turned around 180 degrees, staring at me. The limo sped up.

Calling my name out loud, he told me that sitting to my left is a millionaire's son. Taking one wrong step after another, he lost all his business profits, gambling them away in casinos and his rich addictions. He was now in debt.

To my right was a bright one, a youth with a mind hiding a thousand tricks underneath. The thing he lacked was the finance to back his ideas.

The other two sitting, facing towards me, were different. One was just another bum like me, wanting something greater to do with his life but no hope was left for him. The one sitting beside him looked just as described. A well disciplined gentleman, without a worry in life, had everything he desired. A life anyone would love to live.

I had never seen any of those men before. They all kept sitting steadily, staring at me in disgust without saying a word.

“There is a reason you are here, you are desperate like all the others,” the chauffeur said looking me dead in the eye, “beneath your seat is a briefcase, containing four million dollars. You can add another million to it if you want. Indeed that’s the reason you are here.”

That was absurd, I didn’t have that kind of money, I yelled back to him.

"That’s no object just play along, remember the last one with their eyes closed takes the briefcase home. Whatever happens, just don’t open your eyes else you owe me a sum of one million dollars. And beware it would be collected as soon as possible using whatever means I like to use!”

*Now that I look back on this nightmare, I think the other four men weren’t merely just random specks of my imagination but people trapped in the same nightmare as me. That should not be possible but the briefcase resting by my bedside tells me another tale.*

There I was inside my head, sitting like an idiot with his eyes closed all the while stuck in my own created nightmare. The visions of the other man and the chauffeur faded away soon after, leaving me staring into  an empty dark void laid in front of me.

Something else had changed, something I failed to notice at first. From the moment I closed my eyes, the sensation in my limbs was gone, leaving me paralyzed from my head down. Suddenly, I could feel a pair of hands gripping my neck from behind, trying to suffocate me. Sadly there was nothing I could’ve done to stop that. The grip tightened with every second that passed. The more I struggled the more uncomfortable it became to breathe. I swear if it would have been real life, I would have died right then and there.

After a minute or so the grip loosened but the hands grabbing my throat stayed. With my eyes still shut the visions returned, that time only three of them were left. The millionaire's son was gone.

The remaining three held their look of disgust. The limo kept speeding up. I wanted to jump out of that moving vehicle more than anything else but that didn’t happen.

“Well looks like you do need the money like everyone else. I love this feeling! HA! HA!” said the chauffeur as he turned around for a quick chat, letting his hands off the steering wheel.

The visions went away and that time the game wasn’t fun anymore.

**I had a weird dream last night and now I am somehow 5 million dollars richer than yesterday**  

**‘DO AS I SAY, DON’T OPEN YOUR EYES’, THOSE WORDS KEPT RINGING IN MY HEAD .**

*Even though I am awake, I can still make out that distinct tone of that chauffeur’s voice from my nightmare. Not one of those that you can easily forget.*

*I wish somebody would have woken me up sooner. Sadly, I can’t turn back time and erase the pictures that have been imprinted in my mind as a result of this labyrinth of a dream.*

The  vision went black again, I can feel myself suffocating but I was used to it. A particular sound, the sound of an object, nearly made my heart skip a beat. I could clearly hear the sound of a power drill spinning close to me. It came closer inch by inch.

The drill shaft was pressing against my abdomen, I couldn’t forget the feeling. My limbs weren’t functional, moving my head around made the suffocation even worse. The sound of the drill changed as I felt it spinning, piercing through my skin, going inside my abdomen. I couldn’t scream, there was nothing I could have done to save myself from that torment of my body. I might have shed a few tears…

After a minute, the penetration ceased and the shaft of the power drill was pulled out of my body. I was desperate to open my eyes to take a look at my enfeeble body but for some reason I didn’t do that. The pain subsided and the vision returned. That time only two people were sitting in front of me. Both of them had the same blank stare. The young student sitting  to my right had disappeared.

The aim of that sick twisted game was becoming clear, survive and take the money home. A complicated maze of puzzles in my head without a pretty end in sight.

*If you think you are crazy, believe me you are not… The things I saw in my dream, will certainly make you reconsider your sanity, if you were somehow able to relive my memories.*

The chauffeur was back, the nightmare continued. He kept yelling the words don’t open your eyes. Each time his voice raised, I could feel it puncturing my eardrums.

The vision went black again. The suffocation of my motionless body continued. A push to my back threw me off my seat onto the vehicle’s floor. The limo’s door opened and I could feel a strong gust of wind pushing against my face. A hand grabbed me by my neck and shoved my face out of the moving vehicle into the asphalt. 

My face was shaving against that grainy road, making a mess of it. The scarier part was, I couldn’t feel my arms or legs and kept wondering if they had done the same thing to them or even worse…

The vision returned soon after that short lived torture. The crazy bum had disappeared, leaving the well disciplined gentleman sitting in front of me. That was it, he was the only one left. The chauffeur kept driving forward without lifting his foot off the gas pedal.

The limo came to a halt, the mirrors rolled down. It was my destination. With a grin on his face, the gentleman handed me the briefcase, containing five million dollars.

“Do you want to open your eyes?” asked the chauffeur, turning his head in my direction, “you should do it.”

***Now before you read ahead, I want to warn you that the things I’ll be writing about next are straight from my nightmare, not ideal for a faint heart. If you want to skip to the second last paragraph, you should. I just ‘opened’ my eyes…***

***For those who want to continue, I will fill you in with the descriptions of the haunting visuals.*** 

The sensation in my limbs returned, as I opened my eyes. The car was parked outside my destination. I was sitting in the same seat and all the fellow passengers had returned, ah… At least their bodies had. All of them had holes in their abdominal area with the blood pouring out, one of them had his head removed and placed in his lap. One of them had his eyes missing from his skull, one had no limbs left. The floor mat was completely soaked red with blood.

However, there was no sign of the chauffeur and the wealthy gentleman inside. 

Someone was grabbing my arm, it was the young student or what had remained of him. He opened the door and threw me out of the vehicle with the briefcase containing five million dollars. That was when I woke up from that nightmare and noticed that exact same briefcase lying by the bedside.

*Well, there is something I can’t wrap my head around, how does anyone know where I live? It’s not like this is my apartment nor have I told anyone about it. My rent was overdue, which forced me to stay here at my friend’s place while he’s away with his girlfriend on a vacation.* 

*Was this nightmare intended for him or did he set me up, taking me for like a fool? Whatever the case, I now have ten unattended missed calls and a few texts from his girlfriend on my cell phone since I have woken up from this nightmare. I am terrified to even look at them.*

*I think this briefcase isn’t the only thing that came true from that dream.* 

*If you are ever caught in a situation like this, never, I mean never open your eyes! I hope you don’t have to go through what I did.*

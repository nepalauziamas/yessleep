My wife Sara did something scary and what I found out was so scary…

A couple months ago my wife Sara were eating breakfast, it was a beautiful morning. Maybe too beautiful…. I got scared when I noticed we were not going to have enough milk to make equal amount of pancakes for us. But this was only the beginning of something much, much scarier.

The following day we went to town on our paddle boards. We live in a place that is known for its paddle boards, though you wouldn’t know it from the advertisements you hear on the radio. Okay fine I’ll just say it, we live out east and that’s about as far as I feel normal talking about it. Like I said this isn’t a happy story. No, it’s a much scarier one.

The next time this situation happened my wife April snuck away when our friends birthday was here. She wanted to surprise her with all the pie she baked! One pie was missing? Nope, even two pies! At first I thought it could have been Benben my dog at first sight. Sara quickly reminded me that we haven’t had Benben for a long time. He was at an obedience camp for the day, and at night we get him back. Just then the lights went out and what I felt next had my terrified with shivers…

We’ve (my wife and me) never flown on a plane this small before much less one so orange! If I’m saying too much for you, you’ll want to read what comes next very slowly. In case you get in too deep. A Canadian song we all know, but the virtues are appropriate for this situation. Thought the flying was uneventful we landed without harm. So we thought. The three of us had only gotten more sore the longer we sat, so it felt good to stretch on the way through duty free shopping. The prices horrible and the smell of fancy perfume clung to my sweater the longer we stayed I felt the eyes watching us. Watching us from underneath the table holding the Belgian chocolate. You wouldn’t dare stick around, would you? The next seen takes us further away from the airport.

Belgium, to know its capital would be a treat but this is not that kind of story. I’ve warned you, this is a scary story but if you’re thinking this isn’t scary enough get ready. It’s about to increase a little bit. Belgian was a big scene in 2 world wars, even more battles in the 16th century. So you’d guess there are a lot of haunted places my wife spoke about. We’d booked a tour when she started acting very strange. She kept practicing French words but she wasn’t saying them like the natives. I told her to stop since I was laughing so much. She persisted and I’d never seen her so convinced. That’s when the phone rang, but not in any way you’d think it would ring…

“Awake! Awake!” My feet were feet deep in the pies my wife made! One for each feet! I mentioned there were two earlier. But that wasn’t the worst part, it was just me and my wife for the night and suddenly, SO suddenly the door opened. I knew I heard the door open but I’ve never seen it open. Not in that way at least. This time there was someone dressed as a cop. The local sherif asked us if we needed help cleaning the pie away. The worst part was that we were informed that very scary people were in the neighborhood. Not the kind you’re thinking though. These people, would terrify even the bold soldiers you read about.  If you dare to know more, just wait for PART 2…

My boss asked if I’d be able to come in over the weekend and work on a project with another coworker. He said we’d be the only two in the building, and would have free reign of the facility and its equipment. While I’ve always told myself I’d never come in on a weekend, I did like the prospect of having access to a few of the machines; something I’d normally have to sign-up for, sometimes weeks in advance. The relative vacancy of the building was an added bonus as well, with normal operating hours having anywhere between thirty and forty people on a single floor. Ultimately, I agreed, and came in early Friday morning to see with whom I’d be working.  

It was a person I hadn’t seen before, though I wasn’t really startled by that, since I’d rarely made any effort to really grow acquainted with anyone. The nature of my job was research, and my work didn’t require me to work with more than two or three people—let alone befriend anyone. So, I greeted him, discussed the division of tasks, and got to work.  

Halfway through the day, he came over to my desk and asked if I had any interest in history, specifically in regards to the burial practices of ancient civilizations, *and* the kinds of things with which they’d often bury themselves. I was a little taken aback by the question, mostly because I hadn’t been asked something so casually personal in all my time working there. But figuring that it’d be best to keep up a polite rapport with him, I said sure; and he then asked if I’d like to see his “gallery” of such items at the end of our shift.  

I’m not exactly sure why I said yes, but I did. At the end of the day, we checked out and I followed him to his house.   

He led me to his basement, which ordinarily would’ve been a huge red flag, but my professional familiarity with him and the aesthetic homeliness of the house dissuaded any feelings of unease I might’ve had. The stairs leading down to it were carpeted, and there were cutely ensconced lights affixed to the walls as intervals. The basement itself was completely furnished, having the general appearance of a “Man cave”; not exactly the décor of a deranged murderer’s basement.  

He told me to wait on a leather couch in the center of the room, and went off around the corner to retrieve something. I sat down and admired the room, taking particular notice of the seemingly ancient artifacts and relics displayed throughout; some of which I recognized as being Egyptian, while others were wholly beyond my limited historical knowledge. They all seemed to be concerned with, modeled after, or based on something pertaining to death: sculptures and casts of death’s heads, figures of people in various states and throes of agony, death, or inhumation. It would’ve been a really macabre scene, had the lighting not been so expertly handled to display everything in a museum-like way. Some even had little placards inscribed with trivia beneath them. These morbid objects were plainly the property of a true collector, not some weirdo hoarding mortuary trinkets.  

He returned a few moments later, carrying something wrapped in a beige tarp. Silently, he set it down on the table before the couch and stepped away, beckoning for me to unveil it myself. Playing along, sensing nothing in the way of foul play, I leaned forward and began unwinding the tarp. There wasn’t a smell, at first; the tarp had efficiently contained that. But upon removing the final layer, a powerful stench hit me, and for a moment I couldn’t even see – the sheer acrid foulness of it stinging and watering my eyes. He apologized, said that he’d forgotten to warn me, given how he’d grown accustomed to it himself. Even as I blinked away tears, I mumbled that it was fine, and did my best to regain my composure.  

Turning back to the object, I found myself feeling an even deeper revulsion from the sight of the thing than its smell had caused. It looked vaguely like a hive, only made of.... flesh. The material of which it was comprised was plainly soft tissue of some kind, extremely porous and tensile. It was a bit larger than a football, and about twice as thick. The base was fat, and the flesh-like substance seemed to collapse and congeal here; whereas it tapered off to a weirdly sharp point at the top. The whole thing was a dark pink—not *yet* red, but verging on it. It was so abjectly disgusting, and I made no attempt to hide how much it repulsed me. 

“It’s curious, isn’t? The shape, structure, even the color. My most intriguing find, yet. Would you like to touch it?”  

The question was like a smack to the face. I would have more readily agreed to kiss any of the skulls on showcase throughout the room than lay a single finger on that abhorrent chunk of...whatever. I told him as much, though with a little more tact, considering how he plainly valued the bizarre thing. I didn’t want to upset him, had no reason yet to suspect any ill-spirited intentions. 

He shrugged, and then knelt beside the table—bringing his face level with what I’ll from now on call, “The flesh-hive.” Gripping it with both hands, he brought his forehead against the surface and started humming. The tune wasn’t one I recognized, but it seemed like a very sad, depressing song, like a funeral dirge. I’d given him the benefit of the doubt beforehand, but now, seeing him humming to this horrid little chunk, I decided that he was probably a little off his rocker—in one way or another. Thinking that I should probably head out before something even weirder—and possibly harmful—happened, I politely excused myself, saying that I had something to take care of at home.  

I half-expected him to scream out or try to grab me or do something crazy, but he merely threw a dismissing flutter of the hand in my direction, and continued on with his strangely sensual caressing of the flesh-hive. Still a little on edge, I took the steps two at a time, and tip-toe ran to the front door.  

I made it home fine.  

The next day at work I saw him sitting in the breakroom, only this time he looked distressed, nerve-wracked, as if he hadn’t gotten a wink of sleep. Against my better judgement I went over to his table and asked what was wrong, and he initially didn’t seem to recognize me. Only when I said, “Did something happen after I left?” did he realize who I was, and come to his senses a little. In a frantic, barely cognizable way, he then explained that his “hibernaculum” had prematurely opened, and that the things that had “dwelt therein” were now loose. Assuming that I’d been right, and that the thing was some sort of hive, I asked him where his “pets” had gone—thinking this to be the cause of his distress. I remembered how utterly distraught and panicked I’d been as a kid when my dog had gone missing for a whole day, and sympathized with his plight.  

But in an unforeseen turn of events, his response was, “They’re not *my* pets, their owner has been dead for centuries—if not longer. And they haven’t gone missing. They’re loose—**within me.**”  

And like a trigger, my brain finally allowed my eyes to relay what they had been seeing the whole time. In the span of a blink, the man’s true, loathsome appearance was revealed to me. His once normal, healthy-looking skin was now pallid and splotchy, sickeningly vascular in some areas and wrinkly in others. His clothes were damp, as if he’d been sweating profusely for hours. His hair, well he didn’t have any—it was simply gone. My mind had simply projected the sight of his former hairstyle onto him in some manner of psychological cope.  

He looked deathly ill, and in a final, disgusting revelatory moment, my nostrils were invaded by the most noxious stench I’d ever smelled. It was like a cauldron of boiling innards, spiced with the offal of beasts. He absolutely reeked. 

 I reeled away from the man, who rose to follow me as if fearing to lose the one person whom he thought could help him.  

I was shocked, so utterly disgusted, that I didn’t think to do the one logical thing: leave the breakroom. Instead, I backed myself into a corner, my mind unable to reconcile the man’s warped, molting appearance with the normal environment of the breakroom. In his attempt to grab ahold of me, he’d fallen from his chair, and rather than get up and walk, he instead began crawling on his hands and knees in my direction. And as he crawled, he left a trail of slime in his wake; a sort of yellowish secretion too thick to be urine, too abundant to be sweat. And with each clumsy movement he let out a raspy gasp or a stertorous moan - the kind of sounds you might hear from a breathless corpse coming back to life.  

The horror of it simply became too much, and finally, just before he could reach me, I regained something of my sense and pushed away from the corner. One of his slime-slick fingers grazed my ankle at the last moment, and I’ll never forget that horrendous feeling for as long as I live.  

I managed to leave the breakroom having suffered only that minor physical interaction, and quickly went to my desk to gather my things. Knowing I’d have to pass by the breakroom again on my way out, I brought a pair of scissors with me—telling myself there’d be nothing wrong with using them for self-defense.  

Steeling myself for the journey back, I gripped the scissors in my right hand set off toward the exit. 

All of the doors in the office have a vertical rectangular window through which you can peer in. I was delighted to see that the breakroom door was still closed, but something told me to peek through the window, to see if the man had succumbed to his nightmarish illness—or escaped to somewhere else in the building. I wish I hadn’t looked inside. I could’ve just continued on and kept my sanity. But my curiosity got the better of me, and I stopped to gaze through that rectangular window. 

And I saw something so beyond the scope of normalcy, so biologically egregious, that I still question whether or not nature should be regarded as something worth protecting and revering—or destroying.  

I say this because on all accounts, the transformation the man had undergone in my brief absence was, tragically, a “natural” one, within the context of his *infestation.* The things that had broken free from the hibernaculum and come to reside within his body were undergoing a perfectly natural process of adaptation and emergence—however inimical to the host itself. And the host, my coworker.... the most recognizable part of him, the part that hadn’t been completely repurposed was his head—and it dangled from the ceiling on a tendril of some kind.  

The head had been sapped almost completely of its moisture and muscle, the face shrunken and ghoulish; the sockets practically hollow—the eyes barely visible within those dark pits. The mouth hung agape a little, but there was movement in the lips, and I thank the barrier of the door for preventing me from hearing whatever unwholesome sound he might’ve been making. The rest of him had been divided, stretched out, re-configured to suit some unimaginable design plan.  

Parts of him were plastered against the walls, while others stood erect from the floor, enrooted there by a network of tubes, tendrils, and what couldn’t have been vines—but appeared so. Entire swathes of skin were stretched between counters and tables, or drawn tautly over chairs. Organs pulsed arrhythmically, attuned to a lifeforce wholly separate from that of their original owner. The sheer amount of mass present within the room was irreconcilable with how much of him there had been before; and I can only attribute it to some kind of spontaneous generation from within: the work of the age-old vermin that had taken residence within his flesh.  

I never saw “them”, not in any definite way. The titanic horror of that briefly glimpsed scene didn’t allow me to really focus on each and every specific detail. I might’ve spotted a flourishing bouquet of flesh, beneath which could’ve been the nascent body of a burgeoning insect; or maybe a vaguely crustacean form—*but far too big to be any crab or lobster*—nestled within a wall-mounted ribcage. There could have been hairy, worm-like projections emerging from amidst a garden of steaming viscera...But the images, when they can be recalled, are fleeting; and the last thing I want to do is give them greater clarity within my mind. I only want to relate what I can, what is absolutely necessary, and then forget... 

As you can imagine, I didn’t dawdle. I fled from that building, not bothering to clock out, forgetting that I'd technically stolen company-owned scissors. I left him there, to suffer, to be the incubator and birthing vessel for some new or long-forgotten order of parasite. I don’t feel guilty about it. There’s nothing I could’ve done. If you’d been in my place, you would’ve done the same, I'm sure. He was simply too far gone for human help. Even if he was still “alive”, that life was no longer human.  

Unsurprisingly, the business contacted me a few days later offering a nice severance package. I accepted it, of course. Included was a multi-paged NDA, though it strangely only pertained to the work itself—not the incident with my coworker. So, I haven’t violated the terms of that agreement in telling you what happened. 

But in the event that I have somehow said too much, I only ask that you be mindful of the things you deal with—if you’re a collector of antiquities, or happen to find yourself in the presence of ancient, newly unburied things. Make sure the things you plunder from the dead—legally or otherwise—are as dead as their mummified owners. *That is not dead which can eternal lie,* and all that.

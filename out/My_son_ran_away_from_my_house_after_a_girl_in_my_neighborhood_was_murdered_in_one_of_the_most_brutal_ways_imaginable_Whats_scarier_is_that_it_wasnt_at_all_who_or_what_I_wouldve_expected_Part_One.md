She was a young girl, about 16 or 17 give or take. Teresa Kaufman. I knew her because she was the one most parents in the neighborhood went to if they needed a babysitter for the night. Girl even set up her own small-scale business with flyers and an online ad. I guess she seemed to scrounge up decent profits from it, too, considering, as far as I knew, she didn't work any kind of day job or anything.

I wouldn't know. I never used it. I stayed at home whenever I wasn't at work and my son always rode the daycare van from school, something I told her repeatedly when either she or one of her little minions would come to my door trying to offer the service to me. I guess, to her credit, like I said, clearly her business was doing well enough without me as a client if she was able to keep paying her friends to come pestering me at my door. Well, until that night a couple weeks ago.

I caught it on the 8:00 news. **"Teenage girl found dead in dumpster outside of home."** Above the headline was a picture of Teresa.

*"Just half an hour ago, police were alerted by Willow Ln. residents, Travis and Loraine Kaufman, that their daughter, 16 year old Teresa Kaufman, was missing. After only a brief search of the area, police uncovered the dismembered body of young Ms. Kaufman piled into their dumpster."*

A blurred image was displayed on the screen of the side of the Kaufman's' house, where the dumpster bins were. They cut to the Kaufman's themselves. Travis was holding an inconsolable Loraine close to him in his arms while he spoke. "I don't know who, how, or why anyone would do this." he said. "I mean, she was a beautiful girl. My little angel." Loraine loudly moaned in grief when he said this.

"She was nice to everyone!" cried Loraine. "She was the neighborhood babysitter. People always wanted her over at their houses. *Kids* even wanted her around!" She devolved again into a bawling mess after that. The camera cut back to the reporter, who went on to basically say that, at this time, no known suspects had been identified, but that police investigation would be ongoing.

I cut the TV off after that. Admittedly, I was a bit sickened. I wasn't *overly* fond of the girl, sure -- like I said, I wasn't one of her clients -- but I wouldn't have wanted her *dead*. Especially not like that; cut up and stuffed into the fuckin' dumpster like she was expired meat. Obviously, though, I was more concerned because of my son's safety. Like all boys his age, my boy, Kai, loved going outside to throw his football around or try to have a NERF war with any of the other kids in the neighborhood, provided of course, he was lucky enough to catch them when they were outside.

We'd lived here in Willow Ln. for at least four years by that point. Kai was just shy of turning three at the time. In other words, he was basically raised here. In that time, me and him both came to know Willow Ln. as a calm, quiet, peaceful -- if not *maybe* a little boring -- neighborhood in Weeping Willow N.C. I liked it because of that, even if it meant it was hard for Kai sometimes.

Where we'd moved from, following the death of his mother, my wife, Pamela, the month before, the neighborhood was a lot more lively, with kids and adults alike always out and about. It was fine enough, sure. Not a *bad* neighborhood or anything. Just one that I didn't feel comfortable staying in after Pam died, having lost a brutal three year fight with stomach cancer.

So now, imagine that; the neighborhood you'd known for so long to be quiet and perfectly safe, to a point where I wouldn't lock my doors or windows, without so much as a single visit from the police for crazy neighbors or suspicious activity or anything like that, now has *this* happen. What would you be thinking? What would you do?

Well, I'll tell you the first thing *I* did was immediately start locking both the front and back doors, as well as lock down the windows, drawing the curtains and blinds as I went. I was in a craze, every instinct, both parental and non, were firing off. I wondered if I'd feel safe leaving my house. Was it safe to go to work? To take Kai to school? I knew one thing, I wasn't about to be letting him go outside to play anytime soon without me being there beside him.

That night got even weirder, though, when, in my frenzy to shut us in tight, I stumbled across Kai, standing at the opening of the hallway, clutching his stuffed teddy bear. It was one of those moments where I actually had to do a double-take because I was so out of it. He stood in the hallway, looking at me with puppy eyes. I stopped. "What are you doing out of bed?"

For a moment, he said nothing, just standing there with the teddy bear. I could see him holding the bear close, clutching it tighter and tighter. He was scared.

*Oh god, he didn't hear the TV, did he?* I walked over and knelt down to him. In a calmer voice, I asked him, "What's up, Monkey butt?"

"I had a bad dream, Dad." he said in a voice so timid I almost didn't hear him.

"A bad dream?" I asked in reply, "What about?"

"I dreamt that you were gone. You'd been taken away like how you said mama was." I ruffled his hair, silently chastising myself. I needed to be more careful about what I say around him.

"No, buddy, I'm right here." I said tenderly, pulling him close for a hug. "I'm not gonna go anywhere." I felt him nuzzle his nose into my chest. My heart melted.

"I miss Mama." he said, his face buried in my chest.

"Shh, I know, buddy. I miss mama, too."

"I want her to come back, Dad. I'd do anything to make her come back." I looked down at him, tears starting to burn in my own eyes. He said the exact same thing I'd been telling myself for the past four and a half years. *God, what I wouldn't give just to have you back, Pam. I'd sell my goddamned soul for that.*

"Can I sleep with you, Dad?" He looked up at me with those big puppy eyes when he said this. Normally, I'd have said no. For one thing, he was 7, kinda past the age where you'd be trying to snuggle up with mommy and daddy because you had nightmares, right? At least, that's how it was for me. Not only that, but even early on, I didn't want him trying to develop the habit then either. Fortunately enough, he never seemed to actually need such attention, either.

I guess, though, mixed with my already present state of hysteria, I figured this would be grounds for making an exception. If anything, if he was in bed next to me, I'd at least know he was safe, that I wouldn't find *him* turned into choice cuts and piled into the dumpster. "Sure, little buddy." I said, parting my lip into the best smile I could manage. I knew it was plastic as all hell, though. He probably knew, too.

I took his hand and we went to my room. He snuggled into a ball on the pillow next to mine. I was getting into bed when he asked me, "Daddy, why do you look so afraid?" I stopped. I didn't know what to say to him. I'd forgotten kids are known to have a sense of when others around them, especially adults, are in some sort of distress.

"I'm okay, Monkey butt." I lied. "I just miss mama, too, that's all." With that, I climbed into the bed and switched the light off. "Night, night." He didn't answer, having already fallen asleep. I didn't sleep so easily, though.

That morning, I woke up to Kai's little foot planted firmly in my side. I sat up, groggy, and looked at my watch. It was 9:30 already.

*Shit, I'm gonna be late for work!* I jumped up from the bed and started throwing my clothes on as hastily as possible. I shook Kai awake and quickly got him dressed, too, before heading the both of us out to the car and peeling out of the driveway. I managed to drop Kai at school and come screeching up to the office with only half a minute to spare.

Once I punched the clock, I sat down and began my day; staring at codes on a dim computer screen for at least nine hours. Ten and a half, if I was having to pull overtime, which I was. Of course, programming codes for our latest software and making sure it works the way it's supposed to before our new product launch, was pretty low on my mental "Shit that's got me stressed to Hell and back" list. No, *I* couldn't stop thinking about Teresa's murder from the previous night.

I couldn't get the image, even if the news broadcast didn't even show it, of Teresa's body parts being chopped up and stuffed in the trash like that. Moreover,  I couldn't imagine *why!* The girl was pretty, smart, and generally kind to everyone. The kind of girl you'd see graduating with honors and making some grand motivational valedictorian speech. Everyone loved her, even if she *was* just a bit overbearing at times. So then, who could've been so pissed off at her to wanna go and do *that* to her?

If anyone would've known the answer to that question back then, I'd have *greatly* appreciated the heads up before actually finding out for myself. As it happened, neither I nor anybody else I was aware of had any clue. Though, obviously, that didn't stop the rumor mills from also pulling overtime throughout the rest of the office. Some said it was a crazy psycho ex-boyfriend, others say she'd been kidnapped before being chopped up and stuffed in the trash can, and then there was Kenny with his theory of it being "Jack the Ripper, walking among us".

If you couldn't already tell, all of this was nothing short of utter pig shit. I knew this, knowing the Kaufman family well enough at the time and knowing that Teresa wasn't the type for dating. She was usually busy, either keeping her babysitting business afloat, burying her nose in her studies, or involving herself in some sort of community affair. Basically, no time for dating, that I or anyone else really would've known of (plus, I didn't see Travis Kaufman being too keen on that idea, anyway). And for obvious reasons, nobody (except Kenny, that is) bought a bit of the whole "Jack the Ripper's ghost" theory he tried to sell us on.

Admittedly though, that last one, about Teresa being kidnapped before being dismembered, *did* sound *somewhat* plausible. The most educated guess, anyways. Was it a rock solid conclusion, no, but it was said in the news report that the Kaufman's called the police on account of their daughter having gone missing, didn't it? I realized, if *anyone* had real concrete answers, it would've had to be Travis and Loraine Kaufman, themselves.

On my lunch break, I decided to call my mother to have her pick up and watch Kai for a few hours while I went to the Kaufman's after work.  It was around 6:30 or so when I finally got off for the day and I made my way down to their house, stopping along the way at the supermarket to grab a thing of cookies as a token of sympathy. I know usually you'd go for flowers for this sort of thing, but with it running at least $25 for their *smallest* bouquet, I figured I'd go with the bakery goods instead.

I arrived about 20 minutes later, maybe around 7:05 or 7:15, and rang the doorbell. I waited about ten minutes and was about to turn and leave, just setting the cookies down at the door, when I heard the locks begin to click. The door opened and there stood Travis. "Hey there, uh, what can I do for you?"

For a moment, I clammed up. I actually forgot why I was there. Travis looked tired, worn out, obviously not having slept well and likely hadn't been out of the house at all, either since it happened, despite the fact that the car was gone. He and Loraine share one car, a station wagon. Looking into his baggy, sunken eyes, I almost wasn't sure I felt right anymore wanting to ask him questions about his daughter's murder. Eventually, I finally managed to stammer out, "H-Hey, um... I wanted to stop by and just see how you and Loraine were holding up."

He rubbed his eyes, somehow further pronouncing just how exhausted he looked. "I...I, Uh..." he began awkwardly, like he either didn't know what to say, or knew what to say, but didn't want to say it. "I really don't know what to say to that, honestly."

"I... I understand." I held up the cookies. "Y-You wanna talk?"

A little to my surprise, he actually stepped aside and gestured me to come in. He led the way into the living room and sat down in the recliner. I sat down on the couch across from him, setting the cookies down on the coffee table in the center of the room. "So," he began, "where do you wanna start?"

Again, for a second, my stomach cut a flip nervously. I sighed, wincing, "Well, how about what happened at the beginning?"

He sighed and began. "So, yesterday afternoon, Teresa called from school saying that she got a text from one of the parents she liked to babysit for. The Millers, her #1client. And of course, being a Friday night, I kind of expected that she'd be going over there. She always goes over there after school to babysit their little boy, Andrew, you know?"

I nodded my head. "When did you realize she was missing?" I still felt uneasy asking this. I was no detective and, while we *were* long-time neighbors, it's not like we really knew each other *that* well. Regardless, he continued on.

"Well, like I said, She goes after school and is usually there for about four or five hours, right?" I nodded. "She was always home by 9:00. Sharp. On the dot, not a half minute later."

"But last night..." I interjected, shaking my head. He followed, shaking his own head with an even grimmer look on his face.

"Loraine wanted to call the police almost immediately." he said, barking a dry, joyless chuckle. "But no, I, in my infinite fuckin' wisdom, told her "Now let's not go jumping the gun, here. Just cause she's fashionably late *ONCE,* doesn't mean the worst happened, right?" I nodded. I had no words for this.

"Well, 9:15 rolls around, no Teresa. No calls, texts, nothin'. 9:30 rolls around. Nothin'. And by the time 9:45 came around, *I* was starting to get worried. Loraine had been blowing up her phone for over twenty minutes by then and I started calling Richard myself, thinking maybe *he* knew if Teresa had left yet."

"And what'd he say?"

"He told me that he thought Teresa was already home. He said that Teresa was already gone by the time he and Rhonda came home, almost thirty minutes before. I told him she wasn't before asking if maybe she'd told him something about going anywhere or anything like that. Again, *I'm* still trying to keep my shit together, you know? He said she hadn't, though, nor had he even spoken to her since before leaving for the night, when she'd gotten there. By then, it was getting on 10:15 or so, and we still hadn't seen hide nor hair of Teresa."

"So you called the cops." I added, now feeling kinda stupid on top of already feeling anxious.

"Loraine did." he replied. "Though, it wouldn't have been too much longer before I would've. They came and we told them what we knew. Supposedly, they'd sent one of the patrols to the Miller's as well. Like Richard said, though, she wasn't there. They asked if she might've had any boyfriends or anything like that."

My body stiffened. "Did she?" I asked, despite being pretty sure of the answer already. He chuckled dryly again.

"Not that I or Loraine would've known about. And I knew damn well Teresa would just as soon have died than lied to either of us, and *especially* wouldn't have tried running off with some punk kid, either." He paused for a moment, staring distantly at the carpet floor. "God knows, though, I almost wish that *could've* been the case. Least then, there'd be a simpler explanation for all this, right? I'd know who the animal was that... that..." He choked and said, "That took my baby girl away!"

I couldn't help but go over to him and hug him close. He tried to push me away for a second before inevitably devolving into a sobbing mess in my arms. My blood was frozen seeing this. For one thing, while we didn't really talk or hang out much at the time, I knew Travis Kaufman wasn't one to break like this easily. The man worked both in construction and as a bouncer at the tavern just up the road from the cemetery. In other words, he was what you'd picture when you heard the term "Roughneck", hardened inside and out (even if, of course, he was one of the smoothest, most relaxed men you'd ever talk to or share a beer with), and wasn't one to easily melt down like he did.

But the other reason is, being a father myself, I couldn't even *imagine* how he was holding himself together *at all* (especially noting the lack of alcohol, from what I knew at least), much less while having to talk about it. I held him like that for about another ten minutes or so, just letting him get it all out, before finally getting up and taking my leave. I got back in my car and headed home, shaking pretty much the entire way there.

Despite Travis's breakdown, though, I still couldn't help but wonder what the hell could've happened. As far as I knew, this might as well have been some force of nature, "an act of God", you might call it with the vagueness of it all. I mean, neither Travis or the Miller's knew anything, if what I'd heard was to be believed. Actually, another detail crossed my mind as well, sending me into yet another rabbit hole. Travis said that it wasn't until 9:30 that he tried calling the Millers, who said they had been home for at least an hour before. Now, I wasn't a math wiz, and again, not a detective either, but it occurred to me that whoever did this, would've had to have done it at around 7:30 or 8:00 that night.

*But then, how did no one see anything? It would've still been light outside, wouldn't it?*

I decided to push that down for the time being to focus on getting home. This was partially due to catching the time on the clock, reading 7:45 P.M. I couldn't help then but think about the possibility of finding Kai like that. Finding him stuffed like garbage, with his little legs and arms all folded up and crammed down. *Seeing his little eyes stare up at me from his severed head, frozen in perpetual fright...*

I made it back to the house, somehow doing so without having a panic attack of my own, to see my mother on the front porch. "Well, hey there, 'bout time you got your tail back home." she joked, grinning. That was the exact same line she used to use on me and my brother, Steve, when we were kids and she'd whistle for us to come home for the night. I'd probably have enjoyed the laugh, had my nerves not been shot to hell for obvious reasons.

"Hey, Ma, is Kai inside?" I asked anxiously.

"Oh no, he's run off to play with a few of his little friends." My eyes went wide. My heart started hammering. "I'm about to call him ho--"

"Wait, what?" I exclaimed, cutting her off. "You said he was with *WHO?!"*

She looked at me, puzzled. "With a few of the boys from the neighborhood. They came over and asked him to play with 'em. I figured they were his friends, so I figured I'd let him run around till it got dark, like how I used to--"

"Where?" Again, she looked at me in confusion. "Where'd they go?" She pointed off to the other end of the neighborhood. Panic shot through me like a bullet and I hopped back in my car and took off down the street. I was throwing my head left and right frantically to try and spot Kai. I rolled down my window and started calling out, "Kai! KAI!"

No answer.

*Oh god, please no. Please, let him be alright! God, PLEASE don't let me find him like... like...*

I shook my head. I couldn't allow that thought. I had to find him, and he was gonna have to be okay. That was all there was to it. I drove around for another ten minutes before I finally saw something. At the end of the neighborhood, where you'd enter into Willow Ln., I saw Kai, along with Andrew Miller and a group of about two or three other boys holding hands and dancing in a circle, like they were playing "Ring-around-the -Rosie" in the middle of the blacktop that sat deserted with two empty poles sticking out of the ground that were ONCE basketball goals. Admittedly, this caught me a bit off guard for a split-second because of how... how odd  it looked. Yeah, they were little kids, but I figured, all being boys and in at least first or second grade, they'd have grown out of games like "Ring-around-the -Rosie" and moved onto stuff like NERF guns or something.

Then, however, I got a closer look at something that made my stomach turn. In the middle of the circle, where the boys were dancing around, I could see a little girl lying on her back, arms folded over her chest. I wasn't exactly sure why, but I couldn't help but find this a bit disturbing. At the time, I just attributed the feeling to my nerves being shot. In any case, disturbing game or not, I was concerned with making sure my son came home safely. Window rolled down, I shouted for Kai to get in the car, that we were going home.

He looked at me. His eyes were wide, startled. I could tell I'd spooked him. I could also tell, looking at him, he didn't wanna end whatever their little game was just yet. He exchanged this nervous little look between me and the other two little boys and down at the girl on the ground. I got out and started walking over to them. "Kai, come on, buddy, it's time to come home."

He looked at me, nervous. He started trying to back away from me as I approached. "I can't go yet, Dad." he said. "We're not finished yet." I kept walking, making it to them and reaching for Kai's hand when he retracted.

"Son," I said, not too sternly, despite being in no mood to argue with a child, but still solid enough to make it clear that I was serious. "It's time to come home, the sun's going down. You can play with your little friends another time. Come on, now." He wouldn't move.

"I can't, Dad. We have to finish or it won't work."

I frowned. "What won't work."

"The ceremony." chimed one of the other boys, a slightly taller one than Kai, probably being a year or two older as well. I paused.

*"Ceremony"?*

"We're gonna bring Mama back, Dad." Kai said, sounding desperate. I looked at him. I could tell he was frightened, the way his eyes were stitched wide and his knees shook. He knew I wasn't one to argue with, but at the same time, I could tell that, whatever this was; this "ceremony" or whatever, it was serious to him. He fully believed that he and these two other boys and the girl were gonna bring Pamela back. "Don't you want to see mama again, Dad?"

"Kai," I said, now actually getting anxious, "I'm not gonna tell you again. It's time to go home. Come on."

"But Dad, I--"

"NOW!" I barked. He shrank a bit. I thought I could see his eyes start glistening with tears. Instantly, I started to feel a little bad, coming off so harsh like that. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. *Come on, lighten up. He's just a little boy, wanting to play with other kids.*

I opened my eyes and said, "Look, I don't wanna yell at you, little buddy, okay? I know you wanna play with your friends some more, but it's getting dark and you know it's not safe to be out after dark, right?" He nodded his head sullenly. "Come on, tell your friends bye and let's go home and have some dinner, huh?"

He looked at me for another moment in silence before turning and exchanging silent, anxious looking glances at the other kids before then hanging his head to walk toward me. I gently took his hand and we went to the car, getting in and heading back to the house. When we got back, my mother was getting into her car, about to leave. As we got out, she waved to us, calling out goodbye to Kai. He didn't acknowledge her, instead just kept walking with his head hanging down.

She left then and the two of us headed inside. "What would you like for supper, little buddy?" I asked, hoping maybe we could try and move past the little incident from a little bit ago. He didn't say anything. "Kai?"

He didn't say anything that time, either. Instead, he just shambled like a zombie to his room. I stood in the living room. *Just give him a little bit of time.* I thought to myself. *He just needs a minute after you bawled him out right in front of his friends.* I winced and sighed. I felt like a bit of jackass, admittedly.

It was around 7:30 that I began making supper. I figured I’d do hot dogs and some of the frozen curly fries that night, being frankly both too damn tired to actually cook anything else, plus Kai loved hot dogs and curly fries so I figured it was at least a small way to try and make things better with him. I was setting the table, about to serve dinner, when I realized that I hadn't heard a single peep out of him. "Kai," I called out, "Hey, come on out, buddy, supper's ready!"

No answer. "Kai!" Nothing.

I went ahead and fixed both our plates before making my way to his bedroom. His light was off. "Kai?" I whispered. Nothing.

*He isn't asleep, is he?*

"Hey, Monkey-butt, supper's rea--" I stopped when I flicked the light on. Kai wasn't in his bed, or anywhere else in his room. Not only that, his window was also wide open. My heart dropped from my chest and I instantly ran over to the window. "Kai!" I screamed.

I tried to look out through the window for him. It was dark outside already. I couldn't see a thing. "KAI!" I bolted out through the house and out of the front door. I took out my phone and clicked on the flashlight. I waved it all around the yard, all around the trees in the backyard, and even in the neighbor's yard. Nothing, no footprints or nothing.

I went over and knocked on the neighbor's door, pounding on it like a friggin' madman. When the door opened, I immediately assaulted the guy at the door with my frenzied questioning. "My son is missing, have you seen him?!"

For a moment, he just stood there, looking absolutely confused at me. I knew he thought I was a damn lunatic or something. I pulled up a picture of Kai on my phone. "Look, this is my son, Kai Warren. I think he's run off, have you seen him?" He shook his head.

"No, 'fraid not." he said, anxious and looking over his shoulder. He was obviously wanting me to go away.

"Fuck!" I exclaimed, too out of it to realize I'd said it out loud. He looked at me startled. "Okay, look, I gotta keep looking." I took out the small pad of sticky notes and the pen I keep in my shirt pocket and scrawled out my phone number. "Here, this's my number, call me if you see him. Please?" He slowly nodded, still carrying the same worried expression. I then ran from his porch and down the street, continuing to call out his name.

The farther I went, the darker it seemed to get. The darker it got, the quieter it seemed to get. Quieter and quieter, until it finally got to a point where I barely even heard crickets chirping. All that went through my mind was the thought that Kai had been kidnapped. That some deranged freak had climbed through my son's window and snatched him. Of course, there was also the thought that he'd ran away, but that wasn't any consolation. Either case, my little boy was missing in the middle of the night and I had no possible clue as to what happened or where he was or if he was even... even...

*Oh god...*

I shook my head again. Like with last time, I couldn't think like that. I had to find Kai, and he would have to be okay. I made it all the way to the exit of Willow Ln. again, calling out his name the whole way, and receiving no answer. Finally, I realized he must've ran all the way out of the neighborhood (Or, with the other worst scenario, someone else ran away with him) and therefore, I needed to call the police. They arrived about two minutes later, and just like I did with my neighbor, I immediately launched into a craze of telling them what happened.

"You said he was in his room?" one officer asked.

"Y-Yeah, I was making dinner and--"

"And you said that you found his window open?" he asked, cutting me off.

"Yes, he was in his room while I was making supper and when I went to check up on him, he was gone. His window was wide open and I can't find him anywhere in the neighborhood." He was silent as I finished. As I spoke, he had a cold look on his face. A look that said something *I* said reminded him of something. He knew something, but wasn't gonna say it. Not right then, at least.

He told me to wait where I was for a moment while he went over to whisper something to his partner. About thirty seconds later, he came walking back up to me while his partner got on the radio. "What's your address, sir?" he asked. I frowned.

"1536 Willow Ln., why?" He didn't answer, instead repeating the address into his radio. "Hey wait, why do you--"

"Okay, so here's what we're gonna do, Mr. Warren. We've called for backup to cordon off the exit and entrance into the neighborhood. We'll be sending out an Amber alert shortly. Now, I'd like to ask you to come down to the station with me just to answer a few questions." My heart started pounding, my knees shaking.

*The station! Why? What did that have to do with finding Kai, unless...*

"Hold on," I said anxiously, "You're not seriously thinking I'm bullshitting with this, do you? You don't think I actually hurt my own chi--"

"I didn't say any of that, Mr. Warren." he replied in a tone that told me I needed to get my own in check. "I just want you to answer a few questions." I could tell that, while he may not have been implying that I was somehow behind Kai's disappearance, he wasn't exactly giving me the choice in the matter of coming down for questioning, either.

I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. "Y-Yes sir."

"Thank you, and I'm gonna have my partner here posted outside your house, in case he comes back or somebody else comes around that shouldn't be." I nodded my head. "Don't worry, Mr. Warren, we'll find him." I just kept nodding.

*Please, God, find him and bring him home!*

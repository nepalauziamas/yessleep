I thought we had everything.

House in a nice neighborhood. Stable income. 401K and healthcare. Love. The whole nine yards. The only thing that was missing was children. Now I find myself thankful there were no kids.

A few days ago, he started doing this thing where he would not leave me alone for one second. Now, don’t get me wrong, initially I enjoyed the extra attention. For the first time since we’d started dating he went into each of my favorite stores with me, attending to my needs like he was my personal assistant. I couldn't stop laughing. I asked him if it was a viral online thing people were daring each other to do for their spouses. Like, *take a day for your significant others*.

“I just love you so much,” he’d reply, or versions of that.

It was the weekend, so I didn’t question it too much at first. I surrendered to it.

Maybe, I thought, he’d had a near-miss at work. He worked in a chemical storage facility, so a close call with injury or worse wasn’t out of the question. When I pried, he told me that *I* was his job.

“Okay,” I said, laughing and shaking my head. I knew he could not keep it up. Sooner or later he’d go back to those little side projects of his. Recently he’d been carving odds and ends out of wood and playing different kinds of drums that he’d made himself.

That first night of following me everywhere, he stood in the doorway of the bathroom staring as I brushed my teeth as if it was the most fascinating thing in the world to him.

“What?” I said through a foam of toothpaste.

He did not reply. He tilted his head slightly, grinning in a dopey way. His eyes were somewhat glazed over.

The following morning, I woke up to him staring at me. He was on his side. I asked him how long he’d been awake like that. He told me he was having the most wonderful dream. He hoped to never wake up.

That got me worried.

While he watched, I rummaged through his things. I don’t know what I was looking for. Prescription meds, maybe? He studied me like there was a riddle he was partly trying to solve, partly knew the answer to, partly couldn’t care less about.

As long as he was by my side, that’s all that really seemed to matter to him. I should be thankful for that, right? Like, *really, really* thankful. I wanted to be.

He didn’t go into work that Monday, and, because I work from home, he was there beside me constantly. Monday rolled into Tuesday. Rolled into today.

I sat him down at the kitchen table for a heart-to-heart. He answered each of my questions with care, denying there was anything the matter. In fact, he answered questions *too* well. Those little side projects of his he’d been doing in his free time, they could wait. Work was uneventful. He would ask for a raise soon, as planned. He’d simply taken days off to be with me. He had several sick days stacked up.

But as he was talking, I noticed a jerkiness to his body that I hadn’t before. His hands would gesture too often, yet the fingers weren’t getting enough articulation. How long had this been happening? Was it an illness?

There was a rhythm to his voice and movements alike that I hadn’t noticed before, almost like he was moving to the beat of drums.

“Do you remember,” I said shakily, my hands threatening to draw away from his, “that puppet you made out of wood? I mean, you were really into puppetry at the time. You carved every piece of it. Whatever happened—”

My voice choked off. I recalled my suspicions, brief though they were, two years prior. He’d found out from the doctor, and revealed to me in succinct monotone, that he was sterile. His sudden preoccupation with puppetry—I’d thought it had been a way for him to cope. I had not tried to unlock the study when he was in there, not even when I’d heard two voices coming out of it. *Let him work through it*, I’d thought. *Just a phase*.

I had tried to suggest that we adopt a child, and he’d taken it like a blow every time.

Oh, we’ve had everything in our marriage, including the downs.

What had caused me, two years ago, to throw away that puppet and deny I had anything to do with its disappearance? Was it because I worried that whatever he was going through might become a full-blown psychosis? Or was it because he didn’t bring me into that world, that little side project of his with its own infrastructure? I had my side projects, but I always left the door open for him. That little wooden puppet with the crude workmanship, it was a closed door for me.

Any time I brought it up before I threw it away, he acted like I was imagining things.

I suppose that for him, that puppet was like the child we never had.

As I was dwelling on that big hiccup at the table, that down in our marriage, my husband’s hands left mine.

“Do you know why drums are called membranophones?” he asked quietly.

My mind sputtered. Those drums he’d been making recently. The little odds and ends carved from wood. Could it be another—

“Puppet shows,” he said, “were traditionally accompanied with music. It might be something as simple drums. So simple you’d barely notice their beat over that of the human heart. But that’s not the reason why drums are called membranophones. The reason is because ‘membranes’ are stretched over an object so that music can be made when struck. The skin is another membrane, right?”

I called my husband by his name, fear breaking through like a name was absolutely nothing at all.

“Never confuse the puppet with the puppeteer.” His tongue clicked and clocked in his mouth as if he had a wooden spoon in there.

I got up from the table and ran down the hallway.

“There are rituals associated with puppetry, you know!” he yelled after me. “Honeycakes, we’re in the middle of one right now. The human body is another kind of puppet, right? It can also be a membranophone instrument, with its skin stretched tight over bone and viscera. Because it’s able to do both, the human body is a better conductor than wood, baby. I’ve been poundin’ you out a song and dancin’ you a jig. You won’t throw *me* into the garbage! I’m never gonna leave your side.”

Now I am locked inside our bedroom. My fingers have been slow to type. It’s as though something is off about my circulation. I can’t shake the feeling that my husband, or whatever controls him, [is inside this room with me.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rick_the_Intern/comments/v73xia/facilities_update/)

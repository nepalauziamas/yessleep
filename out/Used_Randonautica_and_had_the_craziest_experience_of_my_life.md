Now, I know the title is a tad vague and over-dramatic however, the story I'm going to tell really doesn't fit in a 100-character sentence aha. Also, a light heads up not only is this story really really long but this is my first official Reddit post ever. So grammatical mistakes and lack of knowledge on the site may show through this post and I do apologize ahead of time.

&#x200B;

Now, this experience happened about a year ago. April 2021 It happened with a former friend who we will call **Angel** and her (now former) boyfriend **Carter**. I would share the location and I may later. For now, though I'll just say it happened in the midwest. I had just come up from Texas to visit Angel and Carter. she was struggling a bit with her relationship with him and wanted me to come and help keep her company. We also hadn't seen each other in a long time and this was the perfect time for both of us to reunite. So fast-forward about 3 days after my arrival all three of us are at home just talking and hanging out when the conversation of seeing ghosts and stuff is brought up. and for context Angel was raised very spiritually and I'd say pagan as well. And Carter was more of an Agnostic. And for me, I think I'd define myself as pagan as well.

Anyways, we are talking and I bring up the app Randonautica, and all the conspiracy about the app. To explain it as briefly as possible the app is said to randomly generate coordinates that enable the user to explore their local area and report on their findings. However, all the controversy comes from the crazy TikTok videos and findings that users have shared. But initially the reason the app really piqued my interest was because a group of teenagers in Seattle found a suitcase containing human remains near a shoreline after the app prompted them to explore the area. And as I'm telling Angel and Carter this at face value they said the app was horse shit and they didn't believe it, but upon mentioning the kids discovering the body they immediately seemed interested. After a bit more conversation and a lack of shit else to do Angel suggested we actually use the app to test if anything would happen to us. We all agreed and began packing up the car and getting ready to leave. I downloaded the app to my phone and got prepared for the evening. At the time of leaving the house, it was around the time between 10-10:30 pm. And for some context later Angel was driving, I was in the passenger seat, and Carter sat in the back.

Now to really put the test on the app we decided to drive around for a bit so that it wouldn't suggest something in the neighborhood. Cause where Angel was living she lived in the metro, so there wasn't much to explore that was actually explorable. Anyways, after driving around for a couple of minutes I had the app give the first location. I remember the location being relatively close to where we were so we drove over and pulled into the parking lot. At first glance, it was a huge (what seemed to be) engineering, manufacturing, automobile, warehouse? I couldn't give you an actual description I'm sorry. But it was two huge buildings that definitely fit parts for some sort of huge equipment. We finally parked in the lot and stared at the building unsure of what to explore or do because the app literally gives you coordinates, no other information. But quickly we realized, that not only were there still people there but the property was most definitely private. So we hightailed it out of there not trying to get a felony haha. We drove around for a bit more and then I pulled another location up. Now this location was a bit of a drive further and it was also in the town where Angel and I met. We decided we'd take up the drive up and see what awaits us for the next location.

&#x200B;

Fast forward about 5-10 minutes we arrive. But this time not at an actual location or place. A dirt road. And I'll be more specific in describing this location because it's needed for context. So on the right side of the street was the turn we needed to take into the dirt road and on the left side was a tiny subdivision of homes. Nothing else on the rest of the street but the street lights and grass. Anyways, we hesitantly turn down the dirt road which on the map showed to be about a mile-long. Upon turning we immediately notice and comment on the pitch darkness of the road. Keep this in mind for later. And to be more specific after turning on the dirt road, to the immediate left of said road was a huge field with no buildings, very spread-out trees, and dirt. Enough to where you could see the entire field without *SEEING* the entire field. And to the right were abandoned houses (Or what appeared to be abandoned). Sorry y'all Lmfao. We continued to drive down the dirt road very slowly observing everything we possibly could while squinting.  Finally, we pulled up to our destination... kinda.

&#x200B;

The **exact** pinpoint was smack in the middle of the field, and considering how dark and late it was we all decided to stay in the car with our bodies *facing* the pinpoint as that was the safest idea. So Angel flipped a bitch so my window was now facing the dirt road and then she put the car in park. We just sat in silence and stared at the field intently. Carter the entire time made sure to stare behind the car and on both sides, because in his words "He knew our dumbasses weren't paying attention." And he wasn't wrong lol. Angel and I began to chop shit about how it's just a field and dared each other to get out of the car to take a closer look. When literally at the exact same time we both spotted something far far far out into the field. Angel immediately got uncomfortable and was asking me and Carter if we could go home. But I insisted on staying to see if it was even something to be scared of. Because from the distance the object was, it honestly appeared to be a black blob moving. So not really something to drive off about. So after convincing her Angel and I stared at the object for what felt like hours, and eventually, we started to notice this was not an object we were looking at but a person. Running in the field. Towards us. And they were determined. Immediately, the energy in the car completely shifts and Angel and I begin freaking out. Screaming practically.

"*That's a fucking person right? I'm not tripping right*?"

"*No, seriously what the fuck is that. It's running towards us*!"

Angel is in full panic mode and insists we need to leave but I again plead and tell her I want concrete proof. (And do not be phased I was fucking terrified too I wanted to leave but more than that I wanted proof.) I needed to see that this is a person and not the mind psyching us out. Because the brain does like to create images when there's nothing there. So amongst the chaos of Angel trying to leave and me pleading to stay I pull out my phone and take multiple pictures of the person. And out of all of them, I get only one good image. It's actually not even worth showing because you have to zoom in to even barely see the person. I would include it but I don't know how to so if y'all tell me I'll share it. I'm on a MacBook by the way. And I'm gonna mention two things first I did take a picture upon first arrival to the pinpoint and when comparing both photos one has the black blob and one doesn't. And second, the photo with the person in it is a Live Photo. I'm not sure If I can incorporate that feature on here but I figured I'd mention it. And when looking on MY end the person moves when pressing and holding the photo. But I could've also made the camera shake so who knows. So take that information as you will. Now after the photoshoot with this person and the terrifying lack of distance between us and it. We finally dipped. But that's not where this ends not at all. Carter begins to yell from the back of the car.

&#x200B;

"*Guys there is a truck right on our ass! GO GO GO*!"

&#x200B;

Now, this typically wouldn't be terrifying because it's a truck. on a dirt road. But the truck was literally about two feet from the car and had its brights on. And Carter was watching the back of the car the entire time and wouldn't have failed to mention it pulling up on us. And secondly, the lack of activity out there Angel and I would've 100% heard or seen the truck behind the car. It was silent and pitch black. So this truck immediately being **ON OUR ASS** after deciding to leave just doesn't make sense. We would've seen or heard it sooner. So Angel hits the gas and this truck does the same. They follow on our trail from the dirt road for literally 5 minutes, after twists and turns the truck stayed. We are all panicking not knowing the motives of the person in the truck and fearing that this person somehow used Randonautica as a way to set people up. That's what we were thinking at the moment at least. Eventually, Angel did a very illegal u-turn and we lost the truck. We all calmed down after realizing he wasn't coming back and started to assess what just happened. Still, in shock, we all talk about what just happened and what we noticed. Angel pulled the car over a few miles away from the field's pinpoint and we looked at the photos and talked. Immediately we freaked out because we got the person on camera. Not the truck chasing us but the person. Which surprisingly for the time was comforting after what we just experienced.

&#x200B;

Now unfortunately this is not even half of the rest of the story... haha. And being 100% honest between the dirt road and the next part of the story it's honestly a bit blurry. So forgive me if some things don't add up it was a long time ago and I don't remember everything clearly. I will only share things I truly remember. Now going forward.

&#x200B;

From what I can remember for some god-awful reason we decided we wanted to do it again. (This was probably me and Carter though, I lightly remember us begging to stay out longer.) And when I say do it again I mean pull up another location on Randonautica. Stupid I know. Angel was NOT down, yet somehow we were suddenly on our way to location number 3. So as we are driving to the location, Angel and I both notice the location is close to her old house. The one she lived in when we again first met. Which oddly enough was **RIGHT** next to a cemetery. And when I say right there I mean she had no backyard just gravestones. With a fence in between of course. And this isn't really important but Angel told me many times throughout our friendship that she saw a lot of things in that house and It was traumatizing. Spiritually. She hated the house because of the fear she felt living there. And also because the last time she went and visited the house Carter, her, and a couple of their friends ended up in the cemetery, and in their words, a spirit attached itself to Carter. And everyone there witnessed it. But I wasn't there so I won't touch on it too much. But all of that is kinda necessary for context.

&#x200B;

Anyways, as we are talking about how the location is in close proximity to Angel's old house Carter suggests that we go. Angel immediately says she isn't comfortable and doesn't want to go, and Carter begins to beg that we should go. I sit back and let them talk about it before suggesting my interest to go too. (Bad friend move I know but I was genuinely curious.) We all talk about going and what's the worst that could happen until Angel says fine as long as we all agree no longer than five minutes and to stay in the car. So she agrees and we decide to say fuck Randonautica let's go to a cemetery.... so smart. Fast forward, we pull up to the cemetery slowly and Angel immediately remarks on her discomfort being there. And being honest I felt it too. She pulls into the parking lot and stops the car. She keeps her brights on and we again sit and stare at the surroundings. And just for context, to the immediate left is a Lake and to the right is the sub-division of houses (where Angel used to live) and the cemetery. And to add a creepiness factor to this all, this cemetery is the oldest in the town. With bodies unnamed, and gravestones from the 1800s. It's a well-known historic cemetery in the town. Anyways as we are looking at everything Angel begins to hyperventilate and panic. (Again this is where things begin to get a little blurry for me) But from what I remember at the exact same time Angel and I saw at the bottom of a gravestone about 10 feet from us were these bright yellow-colored eyes. And they were staring directly at us. We both froze and again started squealing at each other.

"*Do you see those eyes*?"

"*Oh my fucking god at the bottom of the gravestone*."

We all freeze and the fear fills the car, but then Carter comes in. Being rational.

"*Turn the headlights completely off because it may be an animal*."

Angel and I laugh at each other for a moment realizing it very well could be a rabbit staring at us in fear for its life. But as soon as the headlights turn off the eyes get brighter. We all gasp now including Carter. The car was filled with silence immediately after. All processing and staring at the eyes in shock. It's not an animal confirmed now. And as my eyes begin to adjust to the sudden darkness of the empty cemetery, I started to notice more than just eyes. As did the other two. But the crazy part is we all saw different things. I saw a nasty skeletal figure hunched over at the bottom of the gravestone with just its face and upper abdomen facing the car. It had the most terrifying face as it just glared. But the most terrifying thing about the stare was the fact that it wasn't just looking at the car... It wasn't looking at me. It was looking at them. **Angel and Carter.** I noticed this quickly and looked over to the other two in the car and watched as all of our stomachs sank and faces turned pale.

&#x200B;

They both snap out of their terror-filled trance. And then Angel pulls out her phone and starts recording on Snapchat, screaming at the fact that there are literally eyes looking at us at this very moment, and begins describing our whole evening. Starting with the creature she sees, the man in the field, the truck all of it.  (Of course, after reviewing the footage later she's moving the phone too fast to see shit so the video is unusable. I apologize.) Angel after recording the video snaps back into reality and immediately starts the car up and hauls ass out of the cemetery. We drive to the closest gas station and park. All of us chaotically talk over each other about what we saw. And that's when we realize we all saw something different. Angel claims she saw a beautiful seductive woman staring at her but again hunched over. Draped in white fabrics with long black hair and a menacing smile. But it's not a smile with love or admiration its with envy. Angel says it felt like she was jealous of her spot. The spirit wanted her gone. Carter claims the spirit looked like Angel but evil, like it wanted to seduce him but hurt him. She also had long black hair but she was in red lingerie and looked like a carbon copy of Angel. He claimed he was attracted to the spirit physically but emotionally he was filled with fear and knew something wasn't right. And of course, I saw nothing like that. I saw an evil skeletal spirit staring at both of them with bloodlust written on its face. They both stare in shock at me not fully comprehending how all of us saw something different. Shit, I didn't understand it either. But I know I never saw a beautiful woman looking at us. Whatever it was was evil.

&#x200B;

We all decide to go in the gas station to get something to take our minds off the situation. But after walking in the atmosphere was crazy intense. I remember feeling dizzy and lightheaded, and also very confused. Like I didn't know why I was there or what I was doing. This could all be because we have been in nothing but the pitch black now for maybe an hour or two. and now we are walking into a brightly lit gas station. But it was so intense that at the moment I didn't understand why I felt like that. We get a few snacks and sat in the car for a bit just talking about what the fuck just happened. Still, in shock and amazement, I jokingly pull my phone out and suggest we get another location on Randonautica. Carter immediately agrees (not jokingly) and Angel is hesitant but not completely opposed. (You'd think we wouldn't want to do this again after all that but it was genuinely like an adrenaline rush. After seeing so much in one night that was unexplainable the inner ghost hunter wanted more.) So I pull up a location on the app. It says the location is a two minutes drive from us so... we were interested. We all agreed this is the last stop for the night. So I have Angel type the coordinates down on her phone. And she gasps loudly.

"*No fucking way dude. You're not gonna believe this bro*." me and Carter are both confused.

"*What? What is it*?"

"*The location is the fucking cemetery*."

I don't believe her. She shows her phone and sure enough, on the top of the map's location thing it says 'so and so cemetery'. Angel remarks how creepy it is for the app to pull it up **right after** all that shit happens. But we all stupidly decide to go again mostly curious if the woman is still there. So she starts the car and she again drives up the driveway, brights on, very slowly, and parks in the exact spot as before. This time no eyes. Which again just confirmed what we saw was real. Because there were no eyes, no sexy women, no skeletal creature. Just a gravestone. So all of us feeling braver now me and Carter discuss possibly going to the grave to see if maybe what we were looking at was a doll or something and we freaked ourselves out. Just to be double-triple cautious. Angel begs we not get out of the car as she's scared to be alone so I decide to stay and Carter gets out to go inspect. Carter gets out of the car and we watch as he goes to the grave and shines his phone's flashlight and there's nothing fucking there. Not a doll, not flowers, not one single solitary object in sight. But soon thereafter we both begin to notice Carter acting weird. He is just standing outside and is no longer looking around he's just standing. Angel is freaked out but rolls down her window and tells Carter to get into the car. He doesn't respond to her and then he just lays on the gravel. Face first.

&#x200B;

Angel is freaking out now and says this is what happened last time they came here. He zoned out and just started laying on the ground. It looked like he was dead. Just laying in the dirt not moving or talking. I am stunned not sure if I believe this is happening right now. She pulls the car up closer to where he's laying and gets out to get him up. She manages to convince him to get in the car after a few minutes of begging him to stop. I vividly remember her exact words

"*You're scaring me Carter please stop*."

Angel and I fully freaked out beyond max capacity, decide we are now done and we want to go home. For real this time. So we get Carter in the car and Angel speeds our scared asses back home. The whole time home though Carter is in the back of the car talking incoherently and very oddly. Making comments on how he wants to go back to the cemetery, he loves touching the ground there, he feels safe there, he wants to hold the dirt, he needs to go back, etc. Really weird comments. Almost at certain points demanding to go back now. Angel fought back saying that she was not taking him back because she knows something is feeding on him. At this point, I really did start to feel the gut-wrenching reality that he isn't faking it.  I snapped back into it after listening to him speak and I hint over to Angel that we should perform a blessing on him before we go into the house. (Shoutout to all my Hispanics and brujas iykyk.) So eventually we pull into the parking lot of the house. We all get out of the car and Angel pulls out some Lavender and Palo Santo. She lights the stick and does a blessing on all three of us and asks for protection. Carter is still acting a bit odd and Angel points out that she may need to bless him again before we let him in the house. I agree and we head in for the night.

&#x200B;

And a very last last last tidbit I really wanted to share was the next morning I opened my Pinterest (At the time I deleted all my social media for mental health and that was the only one I had) And the first thing on top of my feed was a cover for a Mexican horror movie called "La Entidad" with the photo looking EXACTLY like the spirit I saw in the cemetery from the night before. And after looking up the movie it was EXACTLY the description of what we did that night. I don't know how to include in my post but if you're really curious look up the movie cover. It's spot on to what I saw. It was just an extra encounter that scared the shit out of me the next day that really solidified what happened the night before. There was some other stuff that happened throughout the trip that was creepy but not enough to be mentioned. Footsteps when only one of us was home, water running, talking, things like that. I think something did follow us home from that cemetery that night, especially on Carter. He was really angry the rest of my stay there and also asked to go back to the cemetery a couple more times. They are no longer together and I'm no longer friends with Angel so, I would ask her for her videos and perspective from that night but... I don't feel comfortable. Also please know that I am in no way expecting everyone to believe this, it sounds incredibly outlandish to the average person and I understand. I am in no way asking anyone to believe me because truly, it still doesn't feel real to me. Everyone is entitled to their opinion. This was just my experience.

Anyways thank you for letting me share my story. :)

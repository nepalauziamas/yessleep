Upon our vessel’s arrival on the western shore of the far-flung land of Shiz’Naa, we were greeted by nothing but a desolate stretch of bone-white sand reaching as far as the eye could see in either direction. There were no warm welcomes uttered by kindly enlightened natives like I had so expected and dearly hoped for. No crustaceans crawled its barren surface and no birds flew overhead, even the wind which had so violently shook us to the point of near-disaster not but an hour before refused to make its presence known. I assured the small crew that this was perfectly typical in such an obscure continent, but in truth my mouth lay agape just as theirs did; although I did a decent enough job of hiding it.


My previous investigations, spanning the last four years, had finally led me there to the hidden land of Shiz’Naa; accessible only through an extremely precise trajectory, an anomalous route, nestled in the tempestuous bosom of the North Atlantic. Exploitable only during the most wretched and unforgiving of storms. After several failed voyages, squandering most of my inheritance as a result, I was ecstatic to have finally reached what I wished so dearly to be those fabled lands; thought in legend to contain a people who are said to have transcended death itself. Yet our immediate surroundings inspired a gnawing dread within me. I assumed defeating death would produce a lush landscape of thriving life, existing blissfully and in perfect harmony. However, all we could see for miles and endless miles inland was naught but a barren wasteland of scraggly brownish-yellow grass and scant groupings of leafless trees beneath a perpetually gloomy gray sky. The land itself seemed to go onwards towards infinity, stretching into a vast misty steppe. I hoped with all my heart that I had not once again been wrong in my calculations, as another failure would surely have left me all but destitute once I found myself back on civilized soil.


I beckoned the weary sailors forth after gathering some personal supplies for the journey, of which I had no idea how long it may take, and we all lugged what we could onto the non-descript swathe of nothing-grass before us. It crumbled beneath our bootheels, disintegrating into ash. As such, markers that would lead us back to our ship proved entirely unnecessary, and a portion of our firewood load was abandoned along the way. The footsteps we left behind, scorched black as if our feet were on fire, would be all the more distinguishable even from a distance. The land's unpredicted peculiarities disturbed me. I knew that I mustn't let the others know how truly out of my depth I really was, lest they lose faith in me and turn tail. They were here, somewhere, and we would find them; learn their secrets, so that the whole world might benefit from such great knowledge. Oh, how foolish I was.


We walked for an inordinately long stretch of time, each man leaving his trail of jet-black boot prints in his wake; burned into the death beneath. The air wavered and sparked on the peripherals of my vision, sending me into an anxious spiral of self-doubt. Indeed this place was clearly at least preternatural, its lifeless composition gnawed at the nerves and made one sick with the desperate urge to flee. Flee however, we did not. We pushed on as a group, and while no words were ever exchanged from the moment we stepped foot onto the shore, it was as if each man knew instantly of the significance of this endeavor; that we were on the cusp of something previously unseen.


To my delight, in which I felt it appropriate to finally speak up, I spotted a swathe of strikingly vibrant purple cresting a hill on the otherwise flat landscape. My words failed to bring themselves to fruition, falling into nothingness beyond my lips, and yet my intent translated through some other unknown means and the crew’s attention was drawn towards the object of my pointing finger. The others apparently couldn’t speak either, but as if of one mind we changed course and headed towards the small hill. Still living flowers akin to bluebells were the source of the color; the only such splash apparently left in all the land, and I implored the men wordlessly not to touch them. None did, struck with the sort of reverence that one feels when face-to-face with the only modicum of life in a sea of death. Pacing ever so carefully through the flowers, urging the group to stay at the bottom so as to not disturb the flora more than need be, I climbed the hill; taking all of a minute. At the top, I felt higher than God Himself. I saw my effort repaid ten-fold before my eyes. The natives, the legendary Shin’Takk people, stood at least a hundred in number in rows of ten staring me dead in the face from down below; all of a similar basic height and complexion and garbed in identical flowing brown robes, all plastered with the same emotionless, stoic expression. Behind them lay their surprisingly meager settlement. Wooden shacks adorned a large arrangement of concentric circles constructed using black and white rocks, the design inherently crude, but the scene emanated a strange but very clear power; as if the buildings served not only as living space but as part of some grand harnessing vehicle as well.


I could tell that these people were also completely wordless, as is the case with all creatures that inhabit the silent land of Shiz’Naa, however their minds were abuzz in communication; an ethereal line of collective thought into which I had momentarily breached as I stared paralyzed looking over the mass stone-faced countenance of the locals. Their returned look, a furious glare, let me know where I stood in their eyes in that moment. We were invaders, and would be treated as such.


We were all unable to move, until compelled to submit to the will of the Shin’Takk. I watched on from the hill as the crew were each bound among the center of those circles, of which would likely be visible from the edge of space in their scale, and each man seemed to merge with the rocks, becoming indistinguishable from their former natural appearance. They outwardly seemed almost unaware of the change as if dead, and yet they were so clearly and abjectly suffering. The thoughts of the Shin’Takk became uninterpretable beyond a collective din of celebration while as I looked on my fallen friends I could hear their cries of pain and terror tear silently through the windless landscape as their congeled forms began to radiate a pulsing purple shine from within.


I might have stood there for centuries, or maybe just an hour or two, but when it was over and the men on the rocks were no longer men and their transformation was finally complete, I was summoned to the bottom of the hill. The Shin’Takk joined me there, lined in their formation, where in one voice I was thanked for presenting such a bountiful harvest to the immortal kin of Shiz’Naa. They offered me what I was in search of. Their power, to use as my own; but with a dreadful condition. One which I shamefully and remorselessly took up without a second thought. Over fifty years have passed since my return home, I have traveled extensively by boat and rail. My preachings have accumulated a party of followers thrice the size of my former crew, all clamoring to obtain a face as ageless as mine. Using their combined wealth, a new ship awaits us on the docks upon which we will set sail for the fabled Shiz’Naa steppe. There is little guilt remaining in my soul, if such a thing even remains within me after what I have become. After all, who could possibly say no to forever?

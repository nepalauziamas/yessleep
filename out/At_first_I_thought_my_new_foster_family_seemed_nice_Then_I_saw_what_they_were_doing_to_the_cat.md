Jacob only finished half his fruit roll-up before throwing it out the window. We were driving in his Mom’s, or should I say *our* Mom’s, brand-new SUV. As he rolled the window down, she turned around and looked at him. Somehow, the car still drove itself even as she turned away from the road. 

“Close that window, Jacob,” she said. 

“This new flavor sucks,” he said. 

“You shouldn’t waste food,” she said. She turned back and raised his window from the driver’s seat controls. 

Jacob rolled his eyes, then sorted through the bag of snacks between us. He pulled out a new fruit roll-up. It was the same flavor as before, but I didn’t say anything. In the days leading up to my move, Old Mom told me it was best to be quiet when hanging out with people like the Griswolds. 

To celebrate our first week as a family, New Mom was taking me and Jacob to the Funplex to try out their new go-karts and get in some “bonding time”. Old Mom never took me to places like Funplex. She normally went to work when I was done with school. Our “bonding time” was usually splitting a Pop-Tart in the kitchen. 

“Oh, by the way,” New Mom said. “We need to stop home real quick.”

“Why?” Jacob said. 

“Mr. Kittles,” she said. 

New Mom tilted the mirror so I could see her face. She frowned, her eyes locked on me. 

“We got Mr. Kittles a few weeks before getting you,” she said. “You met him, right?”

I pictured the cat that crossed my path a few times. I tried to pet him once, but he scurried away. 

“Yeah,” I said. “He’s cute.”

“You’ve never seen a cuter cat.” New Mom said. Then, she paused, twirling the diamond bracelet around her wrist. The car still drove itself even though her hands were off the wheel. “There are certain issues.”

“Issues?” I asked. 

“It comes with the territory,” she said. “When you rescue an animal, you’re rolling the dice on a plethora of problems.”

“I’m sorry,” I said. “Is Mr. Kittles sick?”

New Mom ignored my question. “We’ll try again,” she said. “That’s what the Griswold family does! If we have anything, it’s persistence.”

I looked over at Jacob. He was playing his Switch. It was the new Mario game. 

“I’m sorry about your cat,” I said. “One of our dogs had cancer last year and we had to put her down. It’s really sad.”

“Yeah, that sucks,” Jacob said, still staring at his game.

After climbing up the winding road of their neighborhood, we pulled into the driveway of our house. I still wasn’t used to it. It looked like the kind of house in the thriller movies Old Mom liked—one story, floor to ceiling windows, everything made out of steel or wood. It was on the top of our town’s tallest hill, looking down on the rest of the neighborhood. New Dad ran out with the cat in a carrier. He was holding it far away from him, as if its “issues” could transfer to him. When he got to the car, he motioned for New Mom to open the trunk. As it popped open, I heard him toss the container behind us, the cat hissing as it tumbled on its side. 

“Thanks honey,” he said. “I’ll have a glass of Sauvignon ready for you when you come back.”

“You better,” she said. She rolled down her window and stuck her face out for a kiss. He came over and planted a long, slow one on her lips. They made an audible *MWAH* sound when they separated. 

“Gross,” Jacob said. 

His parents both laughed. 

“You’ll be next after Mr. Kittles if you keep up at the attitude,” Jacob’s Dad said, smiling as he waved his finger at him. Again, Jacob rolled his eyes. 

As New Dad walked back to the house, we were on our way. On the drive over, I turned around and looked at Mr. Kittles. He had his face pressed against the metal grate of the carrier, his big eyes staring up at me. He reminded me of my neighbor’s old cat—a tabby with streaks of gray fur, her coat soft and puffy. She would come over to our apartment and lick our front door. If we were splitting a Pop Tart, Mom would sometimes give him her half. 

I liked Mr. Kittles in the same way I liked that cat. Plus, when I waved at him, he meowed back. It was like he understood me.

“I’m sorry,” New Mom said. I turned around. 

“Oh, sorry,” I said. “Should I not wave to him?”

“No no no,” she said. “I’m sorry *you* have to put up with this.”

“No, it’s fine. Really,” I said. “I’m just so grateful. I love your family and also Funplex, even though I’ve never been there.” 

His Mom smiled. It looked like it caused her pain. 

“Oh honey, not that,” she said. “I’m sorry you have to put up with the meowing.” 

I looked back. The cat meowed again, his eyes locked on mine. I could almost make out words from the cat’s tone. I felt a rush of sadness. New Mom groaned. 

“All day. All night. *Meow meow meow*. I talked to my brother, or I guess your Uncle. He’s a vet. When they’re strays like this, they sometimes develop communication issues. It’s such a shame.”

“Oh, no it’s fine,” I said. “I don’t mind.”

“You say that *now*,” she said. “But wait. It gets worse.”

I didn’t turn back again. I heard another meow. This one felt strained, like Mr. Kittles was trying to explain himself. Back at my old apartment, we had a lot of animals—dogs, cats, fish, hamsters. They would meow and bark all through the night. It was a bit of a barn. 

I had no idea noise meant problems. I felt silly, stupid. Of course Old Mom didn’t know the ins and outs of pet care—she collected strays like it was her job. It didn’t matter if the neighbor needed someone to take care of their dog or if the school she cleaned had a class fish no one wanted. If an animal needed a home, Mom offered ours. But, we didn’t have the time to do the kind of research the Griswold family did. Plus, we didn’t have any family members who were vets. 

I leaned forward and put my chin on the passenger seat, looking up at her. New Mom looked over, horrified. 

“Again, I’m sorry about Mr. Kittles,” I said. “That’s really—“

“Your chin,” she said. 

“What?”

“It’s on the leather,” she said. “Do you know how much oil is on your face?”

“Oh, sorry.”

I sat back. I tried to make myself smaller than before, scrunching my shoulders in.

“You don’t know any better,” she said. “It’s okay. Really. Anyway, I don’t want to bore you with this conversation. Why don’t you just help Jacob kill Mario.”

The animal hospital was in the nice part of town, nestled between a boutique coffee shop and a clothing boutique. The building was clean-looking, the paint perfectly white. Outside, the name *Second Chance Pets* was carved in a plank of wood, the letters outlined in twinkly lights. It was the kind of place Old Mom would wipe her shoes off before going into. 

As Mrs. Griswold grabbed the cat carrier, I felt the two Gatorades I had at lunch chart their escape. I looked back at her. 

“Do they have a bathroom in there?” I asked.

“They have litter boxes,” she said. 

“Oh, okay,” I said. I fastened my seatbelt again.

“I’m joking,” she said. “Yes, there is a lavatory.”

Jacob looked at me and laughed. He still had fruit roll-up in between his teeth. It was bright red. 

Inside, the receptionist smiled and waved when we walked in. She wasn’t much older than Old Mom, probably in her late twenties. She was pretty in the way actresses on TV were - her freckles perfectly spaced, her hair brown and curly.

“Mrs. Griswold,” she said. “What a pleasant surprise.”

“I wish so,” she said. “But we have some bad news.”

The front room gave no indication of animals or a bathroom. There was a coffee table with a book on it titled *Cats: Earth’s Angels*. There was also a chair and a couch, both sleek and fancy looking. Aside from that, the room was practically empty. 

“Oh no. Another issue?” the receptionist asked. 

“Yes, I’m afraid so,” Mrs. Griswold said. “ There are communication problems with Mr. Kittles. My brother told me it can build into a plethora of serious afflictions.”

“Of course,” the receptionist said. “We can take care of that for you. Would you like to give a new little angel a home?”

Jacob’s Mom smiled. She clasped her hands together. 

“That would be wonderful, truly,” she said. “Could we make that happen?”

“Of course,” the receptionist said. 

There was a door behind the pretty woman. It was closed—a *Do Not Enter* sign hanging on it. I felt the Gatorades swish around my stomach. 

“Do you have a bathroom?” I asked. The receptionist looked down at me. Her smile dropped a little.

“Of course,” she said. “Through this door. Second door on the left once you make the turn down the first hallway.”

“Okay. Thank you,” I said. 

As New Mom and the woman exchanged the cat, I rushed down the hall toward the bathroom. Behind the door, the walls were a little less white. There were huge slabs of paint missing off them. Fluorescent lights hung from the ceiling, held by swinging chains. As I walked, I heard what sounded like someone crying. I took smaller steps.

“Hello?” I said. 

There was a distant shriek, but it grew as I walked toward the bathroom. Second left, first hallway. No. Left hallway, then it’s on the right? No. It was the second door on the left past the first hallway. Yeah. Right. But, it was hard to think. The screaming was bouncing off the walls now, a ping ponging echo of pain.

I finally got to the bathroom door and turned the doorknob. As I did, the sound erupted. The screaming hit me full force. The bathroom was full of bright, sickening light. I stepped in, head turning side to side, searching for the toilet. But, I couldn’t find it. 

All I saw were cages.

There must have been a hundred of them. They were stacked to the ceiling, lining the walls. Inside each cage was a dozen or so cats, their faces smushed up against the metal grates, their mouths open. Each one was screaming. 

The only thing worse than the sound was the smell. It was like a 4-H Fair squished into my nostril—the hot, wet scent of fur, of sweat, of shit. 

I turned around. 

The receptionist was standing behind me. Mr. Kittles was in her arms. She was cradling him like a baby. He was screaming too. 

“Wrong door,” she said. 

I took a step back. 

“I’m sorry,” I said. 

“You’re not supposed to be here,” she said. 

“I know,” I said. “I’m sorry.”

I walked into a metal table in the center of the room. I looked back. There were streaks of blood on it. They smeared across the table, leading right toward a bucket on the ground. I peered over. There were blankets inside, all of them a different color—some white, some black, some orange. 

“Adoption is a delicate process,” she said. “We wouldn’t want your Mom misunderstanding our methods.”

“I’ll leave,” I said. “I’m really sorry.”

I looked back at the blankets. They were small, probably no bigger than—

I felt sick. 

“There’s only so many homes,” she said.

The more I looked at the bucket, the more I wish I never saw what was inside. Each of the dead cat’s eyes looked up at me through the bucket. There must have been a dozen of them in there. Mr. Kittles’ meows turned violent, like a boiling kettle. His words were painfully clear to me. I turned to look at the receptionist. I pressed my hands together, pleading. 

“I know a woman who would take care of Mr. Kittles,” I said. “She takes in all sorts of strays.”

The receptionist laughed, Mr. Kittles squirming in her grip. 

“The same woman who left you alone for three days without checking on you?” she asked. 

I clenched my jaw. My cheeks blushed. 

“What?”

The woman took another step toward me.

“The Griswolds are a very important contributor to *Second Chance Pets*,” she said. “They keep us up-to-date on their domestic situation.”

“You know about my Mom?” I asked. 

The receptionist pet Mr. Kittles. He turned back to bite her, but she squeezed his neck before he could. He exhaled a breathless cry. 

I leaned back on the table, my hand landing on some of the blood. It was warm.

“Like I said, the Griswolds are very important to us,” she said. “Did you see the new waiting room? Style is not cheap.”

“My Mom had to pick up some extra shifts,” I said. “Our rent went up. She just wanted the best—“

“I’d recommend going to the bathroom now,” she said. She squeezed harder on the back of Mr. Kittles’ neck. He wasn’t crying anymore. He still had some life left in his eyes; he used it all to stare at me. 

“Please,” I said. “He’s so little. He’s scared.”

“Sometimes, there’s just too much of something,” she said. “Not every little angel is going to get a home.”

And, with that, she nudged me aside and dropped Mr. Kittles on the table. As she held him down with one hand, she pulled a needle out of her pocket. She pressed the point into Mr. Kittles’ neck. He let out a thick moan, his voice heavy as mud. It reminded me of my Mom’s voice when the police led me down the hallway away from her.

“Now,” the receptionist said.  

I turned around and pushed through the doors. I didn’t need to pee anymore—it felt like all the liquid had evaporated out of my body. Instead, I ran through the hall and emerged back in the waiting room. New Mom was waiting outside, her arms crossed over her chest. She looked angry. 

As I ran outside, she looked me up and down. 

“About time,” she said. “We might need to work on your bathroom breaks. That can become a real issue.”

“Yes Mom,” I said. 

The rest of the day moved slowly, each new door opening to new bursts of light, new screams. The go-karts were fast, gasoline coating my throat as I let Jacob win every race. For dinner, New Dad cooked steaks on the grill. Mine bled into my potato salad, but I kept my mouth shut. After dinner, Jacob and I played Mario on the TV. Again, I let him win every game. If I ever got close to winning, he would start to cry. I didn’t want to create any more issues. 

When it was bedtime, I stayed up and stared at the ceiling. As time passed, I listened to the click of the wall clock, each second passing slower than the one before. I wanted to sleep, but couldn’t. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw the cats in the bucket. I thought about the sounds of their voices. I thought about the issues they couldn’t overcome. I thought about how many homes they entered before they left their final one.

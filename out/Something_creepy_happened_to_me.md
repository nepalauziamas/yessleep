I've been at my maternal grandmothers place for quite a while now. Before this I was at my uncle's place. I'm just an ordinary 15 year old guy. My dad is out of town currently so it's just my mother, my grandmother and me at home. The locality we live in is quite an old place and it isn't maintained very well. It used to be quite a nice place but it's become extremely old. (My mother was born in this house) We have a 2 bedroom flat on the first and second floor of a 2 storey building. I normally sleep in the 2nd floor flat. Today evening was quite an uneventful one. The sun had set. My grandmother was suffering from a cold so she was sleeping in her room with the light off. My mother was on a call in the other room. 

I decided to go upstairs since all my art supplies were there and I wanted to draw. A few 15 minutes passed while I was drawing but then I started hearing thuds from the terrace. I thought it was some construction work and didn't pay much attention to it at first. But then I remembered it's dark outside and when it happened again I noticed that it felt very natural and inconsistent, unlike a hammer. It felt like someone was banging their fist slowly on something. I was a bit concerned but I continued drawing. 5 minutes later I got a call from my mother. She sounded tensed and worried and asked me to rush down this instant.

 I went down and found the main door open and both the bedroom doors locked from outside. Apparently there was a break in and the intruder had closed both the rooms from outside. Since my grandmother was asleep she didn't hear anything. My mother was on the phone and she saw a greyish figure crawl next to the door in her peripheral vision. She then said she heard the door slam. She went to the door and it was locked shut. She called out to my grandmother but she didn't answer. My mother thought the worst and thought someone had tied a cloth around her mouth. Thankfully my granny just took time to respond since she was sleeping. 

When I reached down my mother told me everything and even spoke to the neighbor's. They said a lot of shady stuff occurs on the staircase infront of the house since it remains mostly dark at night. Thankfully nothing was stolen since the thief probably didn't find enough time to search the house.
The fact that this person decided to enter the house at the perfect time while I was upstairs really makes me think if he was watching me all this while. Maybe he'd locked my mother and grandmother without any intention to steal anything. But to come to me...

It makes me think if he's been watching me go upstairs every night from the street below and that he knows that when I'm gone the only people downstairs are my mother and grandmother. I strongly believe the thudding on the terrace was him since it timed perfectly with the break in. I'm sleeping downstairs today since I couldn't be able to sleep alone. I don't know if it's paranoia that we're being watched but it isn't completely impossible and that small chance of it being true is what is sending chills down my spine...

(Also this is a very true story a break indeed happen. it happened months back and I wrote this story months back too. I have shifted from that house so there's no conclusion lol)

 

I came from a religious background, I was brought up to believe that angels were celestials, beautiful beings with white robes, wings and halos that glow brightly over their heads. They came to earth to guard us from evil, and to give us guidance when times were tough, so that we can make it into heaven. If anyone was lucky enough to see one, that was considered a miracle. I guess that makes me special, or at least that's what my mom used to tell me, I had many experiences with angels, but I was not sure why I was “chosen” as they say. My mom used to tell me, that God picked me because I am one of his favorites and I should treasure his gift, she was always my biggest supporter.  

The first time it happened to me I was about 9 years old; I had just gone to bed the light was off, and I was lying down facing the wall. When I could feel a presence in the room with me, I was terrified at first. Then I felt a strange sensation move through my whole body and I started to feel good, really good, it was like a drug, all my fears just floated away. Finally, I decided to check, so I turned around as fast as I could, suddenly a bright light came out of know where. I put my hand up to block it, squinting I could make out two big white wings burst out from behind the light, and just like that, it was gone. I sat up in my bed confused for I don’t know how long, trying to figure out what had just happened. I decided to tell my parents, so I got up and went to their room, my dad was sitting up reading and my mom was asleep, he told me it was only a dream and to go back to bed, so I did. 

The next morning when my dad went to work, I told mom what had happened, I think she believed me there and then. My mom was the most spiritual person I know, she always made sure we went to mass every Sunday and said our prayers every night. She must have asked me a million questions; What did you see? How did you feel? Did it speak and so on. I was only 9 and didn’t really know how to answer them properly. So, she took out a book and showed me an image of Mary getting visited by an angel. I couldn't believe what I was seeing, it was exactly like my vision, the bright light, the wings, everything, after that I was a true believer. My mom was even more so, she was so proud of me, she treated me like a God, I was spoiled rotten, all my brothers and sisters were so jealous of me.  

It must have been over a year before I got my next visit, by then my mom had told the whole town, nearly everybody thought she was crazy. But there were some that believed her, she set up a prayer group for them and they would come over twice a week and to sing hymes and talk about God. My mom had made me promise to call her immediately if it ever happened again no matter what time it was, so as soon as the angel left, I jumped out of bed and ran into her room to call her. I don’t think my dad really believed me, he probably thought I was just looking for attention or something and tried to send me back to bed. But my mom couldn’t wait, she took me downstairs, and we talked all night, by the morning she was exhausted, but like last time I felt great for days afterwards even with the lack of sleep. The first thing that morning, my mom called her prayer group, and they all came over to pray with me, my mom made me tell them the whole story. They were so excited, everyone wanted to talk to me, some even asked me to bless them, but I was only a child, all I wanted to do was go out and play like the rest of the kids. 

As I got older the visits became more regular, and mom's prayer group got bigger, she was so happy, but I had grown bored of that way of life. So, as soon as I was old enough, I left home, my mom was not happy, she wanted me to continue to do Gods work with her forever, I think. But I just wanted a normal life like everyone else, my dad was ok about it he even helped me pay for an apartment in town. About a week later I was in a car accident, it was nothing serious, but I did need minor surgery on my shoulder afterwards. My mom said it was a warning from God he was unhappy about my decision to leave the group and she begged me to come back.  

I woke up halfway through the surgery, the doctor said it was called anesthesia awareness, apparently, I am prone to waking up after anesthetic and need a higher dose than most people to keep me under. It was like a nightmare, the skin was pulled back and I could see inside my shoulder, I could see the muscles and everything. I didn’t feel any pain, but I could hear them cutting into the bone and felt the vibrations going through my whole body. When they realized I was awake they gave me another dose and then it was over, thank God.  

After that I started to rethink everything. When I woke in surgery it felt very similar to my angel experiences, the calming feeling, the lack of fear, maybe something else was behind my angel sightings.  

I thought if they were not trying to give me a message, maybe they were not angels at all, if so, who were they and what did they want. I decided to investigate, so, I got a nightlight for my room and instead of sitting up trying to communicate when they arrived like my mom told me to do. I pretended to be asleep. Bad idea, do you know that phrase what you don’t know won’t hurt you, well, there were never truer words spoken. 

What I saw that night was not Godly, no, there was no heavenly being, or angelic choir, nor were they sent down here to protect us. As usual the first thing that happened was, I got that feeling, that blissful feeling, then my worries drifted away, and it appeared right in front of me. I had the blankets wrapped around my head in a way that I could see out, but it would be hard to see in the dark. At first, I could only see the lower half of that thing, with its pale white complexion and wrinkly skin like an elephant, it had three webbed toes with a large claw at the end of them. I slowly moved the blanket so I could see up along it, there were no visible arms that I could see, its face, if you could call it that, had along tentacle coming from what I can only imagine was its mouth, the other end of it was going under the blanket and connected to my head. It had no eyes that I could see, and the only other feature I could make out was two large holes at either side of its face. When it was done, it let go of me and its tentacle curled up over its head, like a halo I suppose, and it opened its wings, with a flash of light it was gone.  

It was only the next day when the true horror of what happened started to sink in, and my fear of going to bed started. I tried everything to stop it, from trying to fight it off to moving to the other end of the country but nothing worked. It even happened when my partner was in the room with me, not just to me, but I never told her that, what good would it do. 

Everything made since to me after that, they were no angels, they were parasites drugging us up before feeding time. I wish I could go back before all this happened and go on with my religious conquest with my mom, but it's too late for me now, I can never forget. I will give you this warning though, when you are alone in bed, hiding under your blanket, and you get the feeling someone or something is there with you, don’t look, denial is a gift, when its gone, there is no getting it back.

When I was little, the only things I were afraid of were clowns and the dark. The list has [significantly expanded](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/v3f8ue/i_answered_a_phone_call_and_it_was_the_worst/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), and I don’t think any homeowner’s associations will be putting me on their Facebook pages for a while now. Between you and me, though, it’s more the porches I’m scared of. 

Most people have their own share of phobias or fears–and I would think that those fears would also expand if you found out that someone that you didn’t know had somehow obtained your address, delivered a suspicious packet, and then called you up yelling about emotional distress. I don’t know if there’s a word for a phobia of break-ins, though. And with the amount of Googling I’ve been doing in general, I don’t particularly want to look it up. Let me know if there is such a word though.

Anyways, Mr. and Mrs. P were reasonably unsettled when they came back from Florida, and we all arranged to meet up at the police station to report someone breaking into their house. I didn’t mention all of the *other* stuff because the police would probably think I was a lunatic or on drugs, and I wasn’t in the mood to get laughed at again.

As soon as the complaint was filed, we all piled into our cars: well, the officer went into his car, and since Mr. and Mrs. P had gotten a taxi, I just offered to drive them. I think we had a little bit of mutual trust between us given the absolute shitshow that the past two days had been, and so it was a good half-an-hour drive to the house. 

We stayed in the car while the officer checked it out for a few minutes. When he came back outside, he had an odd look on his face. “Well, no one’s in there at the moment and nothing looks too disturbed, so I’d advise y’all to get a new alarm and camera system, and tighten up some locks.” Then he hesitated a little and laughed, “You certainly have a big house, ma’am.”

There was an awkward moment when I was like *oh no it’s not my house it’s theirs,* and he was like *oh I thought you were just their kid* and then Mrs. P was like *oh no we only met recently* and the officer scratched his head and we all laughed awkwardly. He drove off and we were all stuck in a cul-de-sac until I remembered how to get out of a reverse parallel parking and started driving again.

“One thing…” Mr. P said. “Our house is very small and homely, though.”

Well, certainly none of us were willing to check. Both of them booked a hotel for the next few nights, and I got them to look into all this with me–I think the part that really influenced them was not really having a choice, though.

The next morning, we started with the basics. I was in my Sherlock Holmes zone, which meant I just asked them a lot of questions and they grilled me like I was barbeque. It.. was a mutual interrogation.

Here’s what we found out: the only people Mr. and Mrs. P had beef with was Mr. P’s family like ten years ago when they got married because his mom didn’t like Mrs. P, and the list of people I had probably pissed off was *very* long. So there was probably–scratch that, definitely–someone with a reason why. I told Mr. P that if it was any consolation, it likely wasn’t his family that was involved with this. So then it came down to me. Whoever had done this obviously was either A and Mister Motherfucking Casino, or else A, Mister Motherfucking Casino, and one of their cronies. Friends. Whatever.

Additionally, I was the only one of us who was *not* superstitious. They had a family curse or something (they wouldn’t tell me the specifics, which I get) and they were probably hiding something, but whatever the situation was, it was pretty terrifying. 

So, with this information, Mrs. P reasoned through a mouthful of spaghetti, we had to figure out why: a) their house was the target for this whole thing, b) what was in the box and who picked it up, and c) where we fit into this.  Google became our best friend.

Actually, it had already been my best friend. Before my whole stint with gambling and before I was a loser, I was pretty good at researching things. I mean, it was the whole reason I got paid, so I kind of had to be very good at it.

But anyways, looking up A and Mister Motherfucking Casino didn’t seem to gleam any results. Their social medias had been deleted (I got Mr. P to look up their Instagrams and Facebooks) and their number wasn’t reachable either (god bless Mr. P, again), so I figured I’d look them up later and not waste time right now.

Mr. and Mrs. P, in the meanwhile, were calling up all their relatives and asking questions and explaining the situation, and apparently Granduncle Peter had recently died. I am so sorry for your loss, You’re not reading this but like my condolences. There was no other news, though, and we were back at square one for people with motives for now. So that left us with figuring out what the deal with the box and the house was. 

The only trace of the encounter I had left was the sticky note and the actual money in the envelope that I’d taken in account for my troubles. I am pretty sure I saw a hand reach out and give it to me, but I don’t remember who picked it up. The more I think about it, the more I think it could be a *what* and not a *who.* And that makes me consider ruling out the possibility that this thing was just a bad prank at all, and I think I’m going to have a breakdown sometime this week. Dear Reddit users, comment about any therapists you know that can help someone not have nightmares lol I need to sleep desperately

We looked at every single bill and the sticky note for anything that seemed to be out of place and ended up overanalyzing everything. Right away, the handwriting was weird. I had been able to read it, but only barely–partially because it was written so small, but also because it was written so weirdly. And no, I don’t mean your average chicken-scratch or even Russian cursive–I mean this was like someone right-handed tried to write with their left hand, but the pencil was held super weird and they routinely forgot how the letters were shaped. I hadn’t noticed literally anything strange on the bills either–I guess one of the benefits of having two overly critical people comb over everything too meant noticing things I didn’t. There were weird marks on some of the bills. It was shapes, but like parts of shapes, and the outlines of them were so faint that we had to hold them to the light twice to make sure we weren’t seeing things at one point. After sorting the bills into piles, we took a look at the envelope itself, and there were drops of what looked like dried blood on it. We were getting somewhere.

I wasn’t allowed to use any of the 40k :(, and I didn’t exactly have too much money besides that, so I couldn’t really buy anything. Mrs. P went to Walmart and brought one of those fun microscope things for kids because compound microscopes are like 400 apiece, and we weren’t that desperate yet.

It didn’t work (no surprise), and we decided we were that desperate, so we got the real thing. I dipped a swab in acetone (nail polish remover) and alcohol (rubbing alcohol was the most sterile thing I could find lmao) and rubbed it on the questionable stains on the envelope and then put it on a glass slide. There was barely anything to put on, though, but I managed to do the job somehow. Focused the lenses and all that–it wasn’t blood for sure. But also it didn’t match the structure of literally anything I’d seen ever, and nothing on the Internet gave similar results, so it definitely wasn’t blood. 

We all freaked the fuck out–Mr. P was like *oh maybe it’s tomato sauce.* Do yourself a favor and look up what tomato sauce looks like under a microscope. What we saw looked nothing like that. The worst part–it seemed like it was moving oh-so-slowly under the microscope, and it looked *green* when it was focused on, but red when the lens was even slightly unfocused. I wanted to throw the whole thing away in a vat of acid, but that probably cost a lot.  For now, we swore to leave that thing and the microscope where it was, and to not go near that area at all. I was so glad I wore gloves, but I took an extra long bath. Mr. and Mrs. P went back to their hotel room for the night, I wrote this up, and I will now try my best to sleep.

It didn’t really work, and I woke up at ass-o’clock the next morning anyway because someone rang my fucking doorbell. Now, I didn’t want a repeat of what had happened five days ago at that point, but I was also really sleepy, so I opened the door after a minute of debating whether I should open it or not. I SHOULDN’T HAVE. 

(AT THIS POINT. I AM INCLUDING A DESCRIPTION FOR LIKE. BODY HORROR. LIKE BODY PART HORROR??? ANYWAYS DON’T READ THIS IF IT’LL GIVE YOU A HEART ATTACK OR SOMETHING OMG)

My dudes, seeing a severed hand *will traumatize you*, if you’re not already traumatized. It seemed like it was pointing at something, but what was worse was the way it climbed OUT OF THE BOX???? I think I am going to delve into alcoholism at this rate to be honest. Anyway, it crawled out of this cardboard box (are you noticing a pattern with me and boxes) like a SPIDER, and I really don’t want to write this I am so scared even thinking about it hours later, and the worst part is no one believes me and Mr. and Mrs. P and they probably secretly think I’m crazy. It literally fucking *leapt for me and tried to choke me to death* and I was like half-asleep, so I pried it off with both hands and threw it somewhere and then it skittered around my sofa and it fucking VANISHED after picking up the envelope and the fucking slide, like it broke the microscope while I was trying to stab it and threw literally anything and everything at it, and then IT DISAPPEARED???

I called the police and then I called Mr. and Mrs. P. The police showed up at like 4 in the morning and all they found was a bruise on my neck but they think I faked it or did it for my attention and the box was empty–like not even a bit of blood, and my apartment was a mess and all my neighbors hate me because of the sirens in the middle of the night. 

I think I know what was in the box I delivered, and none of us like what it could mean. A severed hand came straight for whatever was on the envelope and the slide after it tried to kill me. What if I’d delivered a severed body part to the house? What if there were more? We are in the middle of trying to figure out all of this, and lol if I’m not dead I’ll try to update those of you who wanted an update in like a week or something

I recently went to a used book store and bought a personal journal with bright flowers painted all over the cover. Despite not needing it, I couldn't help myself. I was drawn to it. I opened it up on the bus ride home. I flipped through the pages. Near the center of the book, I saw about 4 pages with only a short paragraph on each. The 3rd and 4th pages were stuck together by a dark maroon stain but I wasn't sure of what the stain's origin was. The entries went as follows

  I can't seem to remember who I am. Today I woke up in an apartment I couldn't recognize. I went downstairs and an old woman was standing on the stairs as I sprinted down. She stopped me noticing the distress on my face. I asked her where I was and she looked confused. She identified herself as the landlord and this was where I had resided for the last two years. I tried to act as if I had already known that and as if there wasn't anything wrong but I think she knew. I wandered around the streets and realized I had a phone in my pocket. It didn't have a password so I decided to go through the contacts. As I scrolled through I saw the word “mom”. I felt a wave of relief. Maybe she would help me know who I was. When she picked up I felt like I had just called a stranger. This woman wasn't my mother. I felt like I was going crazy. Where I am. Who am I? What's going on?

Last night I had a nightmare. A tall woman without a face pulled the skin off my body and slowly pulled out all my bones, replacing them with someone else's. I didn't write it down but I had the same dream last night. I still can't recognize this world. It feels as though the more I see of this world, the odder I feel. I can't even think straight. I found enough money to get me through the next 2 days. I don't think I can work like this. I'm scared. I tried going through the photos that were hung up throughout “my room”. All the people displayed on the walls were strangers to me. I asked the landlord if she knew my place of work, pretending I had simply forgotten the address. I was a part-timer at the local convenience store. I felt no urge to go back to work so I found the number of the convenience store and quit on the spot. I'm so confused. I'm scared.

I can't see a future for myself in this world. Hopefully, I will go back to my real body after this. I'm leaving this world. You will be next. Goodbye.

I still don't know the origin of the notebook or what the stain is. I hope more than anything that tomorrow, I will wake up as myself. If not, heed this warning. Don't read from the notebook with the bright flowers.

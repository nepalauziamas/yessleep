This took place nearly 20 years ago. As a child, around the age of 8, my family moved into an old house. The house was big and built in the mid-1800s. My family moved to this town and into the house after my dad had gotten a new job. The town we lived in was one of those stereotypical towns you see that have old history. We knew nothing of the history of the house.

I was overly excited about moving into a big house. I had never lived in a house as big as it before and looked forward to it. The house was just a normal looking house both on the outside and inside. While it was built in the 1800s, over the years it had been modified to fit modern standards. My siblings and I even got to have our own rooms to ourselves. 

My room, however, was a little off compared to the other rooms in the house. Despite the lights it always appeared dark and it stayed constantly cold. I didn’t think much of it and neither did my parents, at least, not at first. After moving into the house, everything was great for the first few months of living there. It wasn’t until I had accidentally torn the wallpaper, that I found a secret trap door in the wall. 

It was big enough to where an adult human could slide through if they were on their back. I thought it was strange for a door to be there when the wall outside my room had no indication of a room being there. Curiosity had gotten the best of me and I opened the door. Inside was a room about the size of a decent size walk in closet. The strangest and creepiest part of it was the pentagram on the floor with the skull of a goat in the center of it. 

There were stains dark in color that resembled that of blood splatter, but as a child I thought nothing of it. I disturbed the pentagram and goat skull by accident. Upon disturbing it, the lights in my room flickered as it got colder. An awful smell of sulfur hit my nose and made me feel sick to my stomach. Because of that I left the secret room and closed the door.

I didn’t tell my parents about it because I liked the fact that I knew of something they didn’t. I tried my hardest to cover up the secret door with whatever I could find so they wouldn’t find out about it. This worked but it was the biggest mistake of my life. Over the course of the next few weeks, my stuff would go missing and end up somewhere else in the house. At night when I slept. My blanket would get pulled off me.

After a good 3 weeks, this escalated very badly. I started seeing this demonic entity at the foot of my bed, threatening me. I would be petrified and wait for it to disappear to go screaming and crying to my parents room. I had nightmares of the demonic entity chasing me throughout the house and always catching me. In the nightmares, I’d have to scream myself awake, which caused my parents to rush into my room whenever this happened. 

I would sleepwalk and when I’d wake up I’d be in that secret room. Sometimes I’d suffer from sleep paralysis and I’d see that entity and it would just terrorize me while I couldn’t move. I would get pushed or scratched. This happened over the course of a couple months. My personality began to change and I’d have random outbursts of anger. I would be mean to my siblings or yell at my parents, which I never would have done before. 

I would feel myself be drawn to the secret room for no reason. It became so bad that I felt like a passenger in my own body and something else was controlling it. My parents began to worry for me and asked my questions. These questions would only lead to outbursts from me. My mother, who was overly religious, confronted my dad about me. She suspected that I could be under attack by a demon. 

While my father didn’t really believe it, he went along with my mother because he wanted to help me however he could. My mother contacted the priest from the town’s church and told them about the situation we were in. The priest came to our house and confirmed the presence of a demonic entity and believed I was possessed by it. I remember feeling a great hatred for the priest, as if the priest’s mere presence made my blood boil. It confused me greatly.

Over the course of the next couple days, exorcists who the priest called in came to my house. My siblings were sent to stay at our neighbors house for the time being until everything was resolved. I only remember what happened before the exorcism took place and what happened afterwards. My parents held me down in a chair as the exorcist blessed me with prayers.

I remember the prayers feeling like nails scratching against a chalkboard as I began twitching and jerking. Holy water was thrown on me which felt like fire on my skin. After that I don’t remember anything until the very end. The first thing I remember is a feeling of calmness washing over me as I felt like I was being bathed in a pure white light. The second thing I remember is the smell of sweet fragrant roses that engulfed my sense of smell. When I opened my eyes, I felt control of my body once more and no longer felt like a passenger. 

I cried tears of joy as I apologized to my parents. My parents wept with joy and everyone one there was relieved and happy that everything worked out alright. We all felt like the long dark night was gone, replaced by a brilliant dawn. I finally felt like myself once more. After that, my family moved to a different house and left everything that happened in that one in the past. 

I no longer suffered. Later on, when I was older, I found out that the house had many owners who were satanic worshipers. They had used that secret room to perform their sacrifices. There were also many deaths that happened in the house but whether they were related to the demonic entity or not, I’ll never know. While the house is no longer in liveable condition, it is still haunted by that demon to this day. The exorcists were not able to fully get rid of it.

This place is an absolute shithole, molded walls, uncomfortable flooring and everything else in this house is just fading away. I've been given a list of rules and thought I should share them with you as they seem to clear stuff up but also are quite vague.

"**Rules for Ashley**

Congrats, you've been chosen for the job of Ashley. Here is a basic set of rules to follow for your job, make sure to follow each rule very carefully or **they** won't be happy.

1. The tinder profile must attract attention. Get the attention of people by any means necessary.
2. If you start chatting with someone, make sure to get their email, this will help keep contact.
3. HEYBABY.mp4 must make the viewer feel fear, and trick them into thinking something is wrong.
4. You must stop all contact with the person after sending them the first video, only regain contact with them to send the second video.
5. YOURHOT.mp4 must make them feel this is real, try using real events as a base for the video.
6. The final video must be sent as a package, it must contain a handgun, ammo and a VHS tape.
7. ILOVEYOU.mp4 MUST get them to come to the house, make them feel like you are in danger.
8. Once someone falls for the bait, you're free from your duties as Ashley, and they will finally leave you be so you can go back to your normal life.

If you broke any rules, **they** won't be happy with you, and you know what happens when **they** aren't happy."

This was exactly what the previous person did to me. Attracted attention through the vague tinder profile, got my email, made me feel fear in the first video, stopped contact with me for a while and then regained contact only to send the second video. Then the second video used the disappearance of the police officer as a base for the video making it seem real, then with the final video, it was sent as a package and contained all those exact items. It was all a fucking setup, and I fell for it. One thing I noticed was the use of the word they, and how it was used. Before I had time to think about it any longer, I find out that someone swiped right with me. I checked their profile, but before I could send anything, a message sent automatically. “Hey baby, I’m Ashley. You look really hot and I’d love to get to know you. ;)”. The exact same message I'd been sent was being sent to this poor person. Then as we kept chatting, it went in the exact same pattern as it went when I was texting Ashley. Then, it happened, whatever was texting asked for his email. It was too late.

Before I could do anything else, he came back, I set the phone back where it originally was and then he came into the cell. He checked the phone and saw the tinder notifications, and then he saw the messages. "Good job." he said to me, but I just rolled my eyes and called him sick. He didn't like that. He tried to pull a knife out, which gave me a chance to run, gripping the phone in my hand. I finally hid inside a closet, the exact same one the previous person had hid in. Then, I heard it. "Why are you hiding baby? I won’t hurt you.” He was sick, and as I looked at the phone, I noticed that it had been recording the whole time. I asked for help, before the recording ended. It was his plan, he wanted me to start running so he could record the first video. "Amazing!" he yelled out. "You've made the first video, but you've also made your first mistake." I didn't know what he meant by first mistake but I didn't want to know. He came into the room I was in, destroying everything in it. He almost left without finding me but I gave myself away. He pulled me out and started kicking me around like a soccer ball. I couldn't handle much of the pain before passing out. I woke back up in the cell, without the phone with me. It took weeks until I finally got it back, and I immediately checked the emails. I'd somehow sent 2 videos. I watched over the second one, and noticed something. It was me, holding a handgun, entering the house. Someone, or something had recorded me. I was horrified, the video of the previous girl was real, she hadn't staged it. The rules set everything up to seem staged, to make the next person think it was just some fucked up joke. The man left for a while, and he never ended up returning for the time I stayed.

A creature gave me a tape, handgun, some bullets and a mailer. It then made a cut on my arm, making me take my own blood and write something on the tape. "ILOVEYOU.mp4". Another creature pulled me out and sat me on a chair, with a tv turned onto static. They inserted the tape, and it was from when I was hiding the phone from the man. I don't know what was recording me, because the phone showed a message hidden in the recording. "Please, help me get out of this place." The next day, I was told that he'd gotten the package. I was finally gonna get out, but at his expense. I'd been in here for long enough to not give a fuck about anybody else, I just wanted to get out. I was woken up by one of the creatures. They told me "You're free from your duties as Ashley. Go on with your life now." I was able to say one last thing to the new person in the cell. "Goodluck getting out of here, Ashley." As I walked out of the house, I snuck a knife from the kitchen. When I opened the door, the man was there, and he told me "Get out of my way." Instead of saying anything to him, I just stabbed him through the back saying "Goodbye you sick bastard."

I went to leave the house, but was pulled back by him. He pulled out a machete, and started waving it around, I barely avoided getting slashed and used the knife to cut his hand, making him drop the machete. I pushed him to the ground, getting on top of him and grabbing the machete. I started to stab him as much as possible, hacking at his face releasing all my anger out on him. I went for what felt like hours before I finally stopped. I left the house, traumatized, abused, and leaving another person to feel the same way. I got back to my house, which looked the exact same as it had when I last saw it. I walked in, grabbing my phone, and deleting tinder. As I write this, I realise how fucked this truly was, and I take a deep breath, with some hope that somebody will stop Ashley.

Somebody knocks on my doorstep, I open it to reveal nobody there but a package. I open it and reveal a tape, "THANKYOU.mp4". I don't want to play it, I want to leave this shit for good, but something makes me feel like I need to play it. The video shows the creatures, they all thanks me, saying I've "Set them free." They reveal the truth, the man controlled them, made them all his slaves. Then, they transform, into the people that had previously been Ashley. Every single person that had been Ashley in the past, was turned into one of these creatures by the man. He always appears at the door when someone escapes. I just got lucky and killed him.

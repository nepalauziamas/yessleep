I run a private campground.  It’s a little more dangerous of an occupation than you’d think, on account of the monsters and flesh-eating horses and the likes.  I think it takes its toll on the inhabitants here, as we cannot continue with our lives in blissful ignorance, thinking that every disappearance or death is just a mundane misfortune.  Some of us, [like the old sheriff](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/jzbsf9/how_to_survive_camping_the_hitchhikers/), have to do something about them.

If you’re new here, you should really [start at the beginning](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/clp5h4/how_to_survive_camping/), and if you’re totally lost, [this might help](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/comments/fz6a1d/how_to_survive_camping_index/).

Things are bad.  Real bad.  I feel I shouldn’t be writing this, but I just need to stay calm and this ritual of sitting down at the computer and typing everything out has started to become comforting.  It makes me feel a little less alone.

I am desperate.  And terrified.  If I fail tomorrow, then I will die at my brother’s hand.

The day before Thanksgiving my brother came to visit.  There was frost on the grass that lingered long after the sun rose.  I think this may be a cold winter.  I wasn’t keen on having my brother at the campsite, given everything that’s happening, but he insisted.  He’s been really into making these little mason jar desserts using a sous vide and wanted to drop off some chocolate mousse.  I have a sweet tooth so of course I agreed to take a couple off his hands.

Turns out it was a bribe.

He wanted to visit the thing in the dark.  He wanted me to take him there.  Despite growing up here, my brother never took much interest in the inhuman things outside of what was required to stay alive.  His knowledge is about avoidance and survival.  While he has a rough idea of etiquette, he’s never had any interactions with the thing in the dark.

I suggested we walk, as the thing in the dark has already trashed one of my four-wheelers.  I also wanted a chance to talk with him some more.  My brother and I have never been that close and I wonder if it is because we are so different in our interests, or if it’s because he tried to kill me.  Regardless of the reason, I’ve always felt like maybe I was missing out on something by not having that sibling relationship.

We talked a little about the campground.  He’s gone through mom’s old journals.  He’s not entirely sure of what he’s found and I’m not sure either, because whatever he said was pushed out of my mind by everything that happened next.

They came up from behind us.  Their footsteps were silent on the dirt and gravel road and the rustle of their raincoats registered as nothing more than the wind in the leaves.  It was the unease that finally made me turn, like the brush of a breath on the back of my neck, causing a thin shudder to run down my spine.  An instinct that has kept humanity alive for all this time.  I whipped around, my hand falling instinctively to my knife.

Funny that it’s become a part of me now.  I still despise it, of course.  It is made from the bodies of my family, crafted by hands that take what they will and against whom we have no recourse, and my helpless hatred is bound up in it.  But it is a *weapon* and I will turn it into an extension of my anger.  Even Beau has noticed the ferocity with which I wield the knife, now that my confidence in it has grown.

I stopped short of drawing it, upon finding myself face-to-face with seven silent, faceless, figures.  More than the last time I met them, I think.  They must have… *recruited* before I closed the campground for the year.  I bristled at the thought.

“What do you want?” I snapped.

I admit I was spoiling for a fight.  The horror of what they’ve done - how they shoved one of my staff into those infernal raincoats - was not erased by their assistance with the lady in chains.  An alliance out of convenience did not make up for their evils.  Beau’s advice hung heavy over me, but I think we’ve established here that I can be a bit hot-headed.  All I needed was an excuse and Beau’s warning would be damned.

“Nothing from you,” one said.

“We have business with *him*,” another said.

It raised a hand and pointed at my brother.  Its scalpel was already poised in its fingers and the blade glinted as it levelled out in the direction of my brother’s chest.  My anger went cold in my veins.  My stomach twisted and it felt like my chest was tight, like I couldn’t breathe quite right.  I  clutched at the hilt of my knife so tight that my fingers ached.

“This is my brother!” I cried.  “Haven’t you taken enough from my family?”

“We have not,” one replied.  “There is more to be done.”

“It is far less than we will take if you continue to refuse,” another said.

Fear fluttered like a moth through my heart, but I did not step aside.  This was my *brother*.  Wasn’t I supposed to keep him - and everyone else - safe?  Perhaps I wasn’t capable of the latter, but I’d be damned if I failed at the former.

“It’s fine,” my brother said, placing a hand on my shoulder.  “I’ve always known this could happen someday.”

“But-”

“You’re doing that protective older sister thing.”

And the way he said it, it sounded like an admonishment.  I was stunned.  Like - I do that?  I’ve never thought my brother and I were that close, so how could I have a ‘thing’ like that?

He stepped past me and approached the harvesters.  They closed in around him in a circle, putting their backs to me.  One reached out and gripped my brother’s wrist, turning his arm palm-down.  Another pushed his sleeve back past his elbow.  A third raised its scalpel.  They handled him gently, their concern belying their intentions.

This was too much. I couldn’t stand here and do nothing.  My body felt light, like I was floating, like I was acting outside of myself.  Perhaps I could distract them enough that he could escape.  Perhaps I’d kill them.  Or perhaps I’d die like my great aunt.

I was ready to find out.

Then two of the harvesters broke from the circle and turned to face me.  They formed up side-by-side, blocking my path.

“Do not test our patience, camp manager,” the one on the right said.

“The cost of interfering will not be your life, but something far worse.”

There’s something about being threatened with a fate worse than death that will cause just about *anyone* to pause.  It’s like a punch to the gut.  I’ve faced these threats in the past, of course, but I had my anger to carry me through.  Right now, I just felt scared.  Afraid for my brother.  Angry, but in a helpless, futile sort of way.  A sickly anger that sapped my strength instead of fueling it.  I hesitated, and I hated myself for it.

“Kate,” my brother said from inside the ring of harvesters, his voice high and strained.  “*Please*.  Let me save you for once.”

The harvester with the scalpel turned the blade downwards and began to cut.  The muscles in Tyler’s forearm trembled with the effort of staying still and silent.  I had to look away.

They took a strip of skin from the elbow to the wrist, an inch wide.  The harvester carefully folded this up on itself and tucked the bloody bundle into a pocket.  Another crouched and took up a handful of dirt from the ground and packed this into the wound.  My brother remained silent the entire time, his pallor sheet-white, shaking and struggling to remain on his feet.  I ran to him as soon as the harvesters parted and let me through.  He sagged against me, his breathing rapid, and I put his good arm around my shoulder to help support his weight.

“Are you satisfied now?” I snapped at the harvesters.  “Can we go?”

“Indeed we are.  Good day, camp manager.”

I turned us around towards the direction of home.  The harvesters went in the opposite direction, returning to the deep woods.

“Guess we won’t be visiting the thing in the dark after all,” my brother said with a weak laugh.

“Are you going to make it back?” I asked him.

“I think so.”  He glanced down at his arm, dangling limply at his side.  “Bleeding has stopped.”

I looked over.  Blood was no longer running down his arm and the blood already coating his wrist and fingers was starting to dry into a tacky film.  The dirt had turned to mud from the blood, tinged darkly red, but it was holding fast to the wound.  I told him to not touch it.  Certainly, it didn’t seem sanitary, but it was something they’d done to other victims.  It stopped the bleeding and no one had developed an infection from it yet.  I suppose it was the rare mercy they afforded for the ones they didn’t want to die.

I radioed for staff to meet us with a four-wheeler and to get an ambulance out to the campground.  It was a smart move, for Tyler didn’t make it that far before he collapsed and threw up in the ditch.  There was blood mixed in the bile and Tyler admitted that he’d been biting his cheek the whole time to keep from screaming.  With the harvesters now out of sight, I felt we could just sit and wait until help arrived to transport him the rest of the way.

Maybe he was delirious from blood loss or pain, but as they were loading him up in the back of the ambulance, he invited me to Thanksgiving.

I’ve never celebrated with my brother and his wife before.  In the past I’ve spent it with my aunt and uncle, but they’re both dead now.  This year, I had some offers from other relatives because even though the family is in turmoil about how this worst year is being handled and at odds as to what I should be doing instead, we’re still family.  They must have conspired behind my back because I got a handful of strategic offers, carefully timed so that I could take my pick of what kind of Thanksgiving dinner I wanted.  Did I want to eat with some relatives close to my age where the house would be filled with screaming children?  Or did I want to eat with someone from the prior generation where it would be quiet, demure, and we’d probably all pass out and nap during the post-meal football game?

I even got offers from outside the family, which was unusual.  I suppose everyone feels sorry for me right now?  Bryan offered, somewhat awkwardly, clarifying that his mother was the one that came up with the idea.  The old sheriff called me up and offered, saying that his wife promised it would be a mundane Thanksgiving, no additional… oddness.  This wasn’t her people’s holiday, after all.  I even had Ed - yes, the old staff member - offer to host.  He got a deep fryer this year and was anxious to show it off.  I don’t think he had any other plans other than the turkey, though.  (I called in a favor with a townie and they’re dropping off some stuffing and mashed potatoes for him)

I tentatively brought up the offer again as we sat in the ER, waiting while the nurse washed his arm down with povidone-iodine and bandaged it up.  He didn’t need a skin graft, the doctor said, but it was going to leave a nasty scar.

Turns out the offer was genuine.  His wife’s idea.  She’d sent Tyler to ask me in person, as well as drop off some of that mousse.  The detour into the woods was his idea, and she fixed him with a steely glare as she said that.

So I stepped into the hallway and called the old sheriff and told him about my brother’s offer and he said I should take it.  Certainly, I’d said I’d have Thanksgiving with them and we’d agreed to talk out what happened between us after dinner, but this was an offer of peace from Tyler’s wife.  I should accept it.  He’d said some things he shouldn’t and I’d lost my temper, but I knew that he’d always be here for me, right?  And he knew I was doing what I could, right?

Yeah.  I knew, I said.  I’d go have dinner with my brother.

The ER released him and his wife drove him home.  I drove to the grocery store in the next town over, because I was now responsible for bringing mashed potatoes and cranberry sauce.

So that brings us to the real problem.  The one I may have to die for.

I showed up early to Thanksgiving to help his wife finish cooking.  Tyler of course couldn’t help much, with his one arm bandaged up and hurting.  He sat on the sofa and kept the baby occupied, which as far as I could tell just involved making faces at her.  It was a peaceful and ordinary dinner.  We didn’t talk about the campground or any other unnatural things.  His wife was making plans for Christmas already.  I pointed out that their daughter would be too young to remember anything and Tyler crossly said that wasn’t the *point*.  It was her first Christmas.  Besides, shouldn’t I be making more of an effort if I didn’t want to take a swim with the shulikun again?

Okay, so we didn’t entirely avoid talking about anything inhuman.

Halfway through dinner they put their daughter down to nap in her crib.  We listened to her burbling on the baby monitor for a while before she dozed off.  Then, as his wife was getting the pumpkin pie and as Tyler was happily recounting the time the highschool physics teacher taught us about velocity by bringing a BB rifle into the classroom, I heard something odd.  At first I thought it was the baby monitor and that the infant was waking up.  Then the sound shifted, drawing closer to the front of the house.  I hastily shushed Tyler and listened intently.

Across the table, my brother grew pale.  He knew what this sudden tension on my face meant.  From the kitchen, his wife began to ask what was wrong, and he motioned for her to be quiet.

“I hear it too,” he whispered.

“Go get your gun,” I told him.

The quiet stamp of a large hoofed animal.  It was circling the house.

Carefully, Tyler pushed his chair back from the table.  The shotgun was in a gun case in the garage.  The key was hidden in the bedroom.  They figured it wasn’t too soon to start practicing gun safety, with a baby in the house, but now those precautions were working against us.  I also got up and made for my purse, where my knife was stored away.  I saw his wife raise an eyebrow at me as I pulled it out.

Clearly she did not hear the hoofbeats or did not register their significance.  I gestured for her to walk towards me, but I suppose I didn’t hide where my gaze was set well enough, for instead she turned around to see what I was looking at.

Staring in through the kitchen window was the dapple-gray stallion.  Its forehead pressed against the window and its breath fogged up the panes, so that the only part of it you could see clearly were its eyes.

My brother’s wife cursed and stumbled backwards, nearly dropping the pumpkin pie.  She hastily shoved it onto the counter, even while I yelled at her to forget the damn pie, she needed to *move.*  I lunged forwards, trying to grab her and drag her backwards, but the horse was faster.  It jerked its head back, and then slammed its forehead forwards and through the glass.  The window shattered, the frame cracked, and the horse’s head was inside the house.  It opened its mouth and screamed at us, a maniacal braying, and I swear that I saw unnaturally prominent *canines* when it opened its mouth.  Then it thrashed its head back and forth and the house groaned at the force of its body.  The plaster around the window began to crack and the nearest cupboard fell from the wall and smashed against the floor with a deafening sound of shattering dishware.

I seized Tyler’s wife and dragged her backwards, putting her behind me.  I brandished the knife at the horse and it paused, breathing hard, one eye staring warily at me.

“Your master is looking for you,” I said evenly.  “Maybe you should just… *clear out* before it finds you, hmm?”

Then Tyler burst into the kitchen with his shotgun.  He didn’t even hesitate.  He just raised the gun and fired.  The horse screeched and ripped its head backwards, back through the window, as the blast sliced through its thick hide and splattered blood across the sink and countertops.  For a moment, we stood still, breathing hard, and listened as the horse retreated.

“How is it here?” my brother asked breathlessly.  “It hasn’t come here before.”

I turned, trying to follow the sound of the horse’s movements.  It was retreating, but it wasn’t gone yet.  Still circling the house, albeit from a safer distance.

“The mud,” I said in horror.  “We took it off too soon.”

Both my brother and his wife stared at me like I was crazy, but I forged ahead with my theory.  I’m used to such looks.

“In the stories.  That’s how it works - the mud is used to cover up the blood so you don’t leave a trail.  I thought it would be safe once you were off the campground, but it wasn’t the creatures on the campground they were trying to hide you from.  It was the horse.  And we took it off before you were safely home.”

“We led it here,” my brother said, aghast as realization dawned on him.  “It’s after *me*.”

From somewhere else in the house came the sound of another window shattering.  Tyler swore and ran towards it, reloading the shotgun as he ran.  I stayed with his wife, putting her up against an interior wall so that I’d be between her and anything that got inside.  ‘Anything’ being a horse the size of an elephant.  I’m not really sure what I hoped to do, considering it’d probably collapse the roof on top of us if it decided to just take out a wall to get inside.

Another window shattered, this time from the opposite end of the house.

“It’s *toying* with us!” my brother shouted.

“So when Tyler said a horse told him to kill you as children…” his wife said tentatively.

“Yep.  This is it.”

“I had a horse try to kill me as a kid,” she said with a nervous giggle.  It bordered on the edge of hysteria, so I thought it best that she keep talking, even if it wasn’t helpful.  “It was a shetland pony and its name was Goldenrod.”

“Well our Goldenrod is the size of an elephant and eats people,” I muttered.

More glass shattered.  The house groaned and I heard wood splinter.  How many windows were in this house, anyway?  Did the horse intend on breaking all of them, just for giggles?

Then I heard the sound of a baby screaming.

I started to move in that direction, but Tyler’s wife was faster.  She shoved past me, screaming her child’s name, and sprinted in the direction of the nursery.  She got there before either of us.  I arrived just in time to look over Tyler’s shoulder at the shattered window, the wall underneath bent inwards where the horse had pushed through the frame and the plaster.  Just far enough to get its neck further inside the house so that it could reach the crib.

The baby was gone.

His wife collapsed, clutching at the bars of the crib.  Her screams were the only thing I could hear.  Numb, I stood there and watched as Tyler went to her, taking her shoulders, and she pulled away from him, still screaming.  Struck weakly at his face and his arms until he let go and he could only stand there helplessly.  Then he turned to me, his face hollow.  Like I was looking at a dead man.

I didn’t say anything.  I just picked up the shotgun and climbed over the broken window frame.  I followed the horse’s prints, sunk deep into the earth that was still soft from a recent rain.  I followed it to where it waited for me at the edge of the property.

My niece was on its back.  She lay on her back, seemingly stuck fast by some power.  She appeared unharmed and was making quiet noises of confusion and dismay, but did not seem to be in any great distress.

“It’s me you want, right?” I asked the horse, slowly approaching, keeping the shotgun’s barrel pointed at the ground.  “Give her back to them and you can have me.”

The horse turned its head sideways, eyeing me carefully, and then it *spoke*.  Its voice was thick and guttural, like it was choking out its words.

“I am not as simple a brute creature as you assume,” it said.  “I do not want to be the one to kill you.  I have already foregone such opportunities.”

“You want my brother to do it.”

“Yessss.”  It trailed off into a neighing laugh.  “But because he is recalcitrant, I must find a substitute.”

My niece.

It would raise her, it said.  She would grow quickly, feral and strong, and it would teach her to eat the flesh of her own kind.  When she was ready, it would send her to the campground and I would die at the hand of my own kin and they would both consume my body.  It seemed deeply pleased at the thought of such a betrayal.

“Are you trying to take over the campground too?”

I edged closer, trying to decide if I could cross the distance in time.  If I could even *reach* with my knife.  I felt like any attempt would look like a jack russell terrier taking on a great dane, with similar results.

“Perhaps I could,” it replied.  “If you rid it of my former master first.”

It seemed disinterested, perhaps believing I wasn’t capable of such a feat.  Then it made a different offer.  It would give my niece back to her parents, it said, if my brother finished what he started so long ago.  What the dapple-gray stallion had whispered in his ear, when it promised to make him greater than me, when it promised him everything that he couldn’t have.

Kill me.  Kill me, and give himself over to the dapple-gray stallion’s will.

Only then would he release my niece.

We had three days to decide.

I’m a campground manager.  But I am also a sister and I am also an aunt.  Perhaps my family is a little selfish, keeping this campground running so that the town - and us - can survive and even profit off it.  I am certainly a selfish person, viewing the deaths of my campers as an inconvenience at first and then as a personal defeat, as a challenge I failed to rise to, instead of a tragedy to grieve.  But there are a few things where that selfishness is stripped away.

Blood is one of them.  Family.

I think of my late aunt and how she knocked me unconscious so that I couldn’t interfere with her sacrifice.  So that I wouldn’t stop her from giving herself to the little girl, so that she would die instead of me.

The power of sacrifice is the strongest power of them all.

I spent Friday getting my affairs in order.  Then I called my brother today and asked him to come over to my house.  Just him, so we could talk without his wife present.  I told him I was going to make an attempt at the dapple-gray stallion’s capture.  I have no plan.  There isn’t time.  But if I fail - then we take the bargain.

I gave him my pistol.  He knows what to do with it.

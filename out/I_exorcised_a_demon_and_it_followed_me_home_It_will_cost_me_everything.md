The thing I love the most about specializing in exorcism is not so much the excitement or thrill of the Church, but the happy, smiling faces of my clients afterwards.

Especially children.

He was the splitting image of my little nephew, right down to the brown hair as flat as a river through a valley. He was lying still as a stone, his hands limp by his sides, his face like Death itself. For a moment his heart stopped, and mine did too.

Each passing second was agony.

Then his eyes flew open, and his breathing stabilised. The colour came slowly back to his cheeks. The boy sat up, coughing out blood. He wiped his mouth with a handkerchief.

Then he smiled that rainbow smile that made my heart flutter inside. The smile that always makes this job so worthwhile.

“Thank you Father Peter!”

The mother started to sob, her emotions gushing out of her like water from a dam. I squeezed her hand tight and whispered everything was going to be all right.

With a final smile, I grabbed my hat and started out the front door.

“Wait!” 

I turned to see the mother’s eyes sparkling. Relief. Gratitude. She struggled to get the words out.

“Father Peter, thank you so much!”

I smiled at her and tipped my hat. “It isn’t a problem, ma’am”

She burst into tears again and I could still hear her as I made my way down to the bus. I was still laughing, giddy with joy at another successful exorcism, but as the bus pulled away from the station and lumbered down the road, worry started to creep in and my heart sank with dread.

For my own little boy was not well.

I had big dreams for my nephew. I was there when he was born and I was there for his christening and baptism.

 I named him Peter—Peter the Tenth—after me and my father and all the men that came before me. I was hoping, as all fathers would, that he would follow me into priesthood. I dreamed of the day I could teach him my tips and tricks, the day he could successfully exorcise his first demon like a baby taking his first steps, and of the day I could finally tell him *Son, I am so proud of you.*

But the house was too quiet as I slipped back home and hung up my hat. The sunlight slipped into the late afternoon, illuminating a long white arm that stretched across the hall. My sister, Maria, was frozen on the couch, staring listlessly at the television. The sound had dulled out to babble that did not matter anymore.

I tiptoed up to my son’s room where he lay. He was barely moving; his face was the colour of weak tea. Shadows fluttered beneath closed eyelids. Sweat dribbled down his face and moistened his bedsheets.

I lay a hand on his forehead. It came away hot.

“You’ll get better, Junior,” I whispered, lips trembling. “Daddy swears he will do everything he can to help you.”

The empty promise hung into the air as I closed the door and went downstairs to sit with my sister. He would never get better. That was the fact I had to deal with, the fact my wife had to deal with, the reality that hit us day after day as our dear son got worse and worse. Money was running out; time was running out.

We simply did not know what to do.

My sister gripped my hand, her knuckles white. She leaned against me like a house of cards, and she closed her eyes and went to sleep. Poor Maria. Tomorrow she would wake up to another nightmare.

 I drifted off myself, my dreams plagued with worry.

***
“Good morning, Mother.”

“Good morning, Uncle.”

Maria screamed.

I opened my eyes to a miracle.

Junior was standing in front of us. He was wearing a freshly-starched button-up shirt, black pants and a tie. He was standing straight like a soldier to attention, and he was smiling.

It had been a long time since I saw him smile.

“How are you feeling, Junior?” I gasped.

“Perfectly fine, thank you so much for asking, Father.”

I clasped my nephew’s hands into my own. It felt like grasping a cold fish but his eyes shone like fire. “Thank you, Lord,” I whispered, tears in my eyes, “for healing my nephew. I will forever repay you with your kindness.”

My nephew shivered at my touch, and squirmed in my grip. A look of worry crossed his face; but then it relaxed into a smile.

“I am glad I can make you happy, Uncle,” he said.

He insisted on sitting at the breakfast table with us. Usually he would be fidgety, restless, before inhaling his food and rushing out the front door. Today he sat up straight at the breakfast table like an iron rod was shoved down his back. 

Maria set down a plate of sausages down in front of him. Junior picked up his cutlery, sawed the sausage into pieces, then nibbled into each one daintily with a fork.

My jaw dropped. For years we had been struggling to teach him how to eat, but he had improved by leaps and bounds overnight.

After breakfast Junior cleared the table and insisted on helping his mum with the dishes, so I retreated to my study. But when I opened the door, my heart stopped short.

My study was a mess. My bibles were ripped apart, shredded paper falling down to the ground like snow. The shelves had crumbled into wooden planks that were piled up like firewood.

But what chilled me to the bone were the pentagrams. Thousands of them, drawn painstakingly all over my study, crawling up the walls and on the floor. Over and over, a pattern, almost like wallpaper.

Each had a single five-pointed star in the centre. It was the colour of blood.

As I began to tidy up, I couldn’t stop staring at the pentagrams. The five-pointed crimson star seemed *familiar* somehow. I must have studied about it before, but it seemed to have slipped my memory. 

To make it worse, all my notes on that star were gone. Eaten by the looks of it.

A cold breeze swept through the room. I stared at the star again, and it *clicked*. The house yesterday. I saw the same star on the walls of his house.

And as if to confirm it all, cold laughter wafted through the room, making my hair stand on end.

I clenched my fists until it turned white. 

I would not rest until that demon is gone.

I swear on it.

The laughter came again, this time from downstairs, and I burst into the kitchen to find… nothing but the head of a raccoon on the kitchen table. It was nearly severed, showing only the blood vessels jutting out. Its eyes rolled backwards, showing only the whites, and as I watched, its whiskers quivered with fear, before it became still again.

Shadows danced behind the curtain. It was my sister, laughing, drinking something out of a wine glass. More blood seeped underneath the curtain as she refilled the glass.

My hand went to my mouth.

Junior was nowhere to be found.

Images flashed into my mind of my young son on a tree somewhere, or on a wall, nailed down with his head dangling like that of a raccoon. 

I shivered. My heart leapt in my throat. My brain screamed at me to go find him.

But I couldn’t.

I was stuck. 

I ripped open the curtain, cross at the ready, to find no one there. She was gone as quickly as she appeared.

“Maria.”

My thoughts were going out of control. Tears welled into my eyes. I struggled to find what to say next.

“I will find Junior. We will do this together. The Demon will not win.”

I fled. I didn’t know how long I was in that study, but the daylight seemed to have vanished into a deep shade of gold. Shadows emerged, formed intricate patterns that crawled against the walls like the branches of a tree.

Then the shadows fled to what looked like a huge spider.

Scuttling across the walls.

I swung my light around, but it was gone. My wife was laughing. Whatever that was was hissing. My head was spinning.

“Junior?” I called out. I wanted to sound brave, but my voice was so small.

I crept around the house. 

“Junior?”

He wasn’t in the study. 

“Junior?”

He wasn’t in the bedrooms. 

“JUNIOR!!!”

He wasn’t in the yard. 

It was still watching me, the thing. I could feel it, the way its gaze bore down on my back. I kept on hearing heavy breathing, a heart, quivering with excitement, but when I turned around, yelling, bottle at the ready—it was gone.

The treehouse was the last place I checked. Junior loved that place. Back before he was sick, he would spend every waking moment there, rocking in his hammock, gazing at the blue sky and the clouds drifting lazily by, or spend his afternoons drawing with his crayons.

Now the hammock swung with the wind; the planks creaked under my footsteps like a haunted house. New drawings were on the walls, but it depicted the same symbol, over and over.

The five-pointed crimson star.

I forced myself to ignore the star, grit my teeth, and began to search. Hammock, rug, dusty corners. Hammock, rug, dusty corners. Yet it began to get increasingly harder as the sun went down and the light began to fade, so I carefully placed one of my purifying candles on the wooden table and moved to light it.

But then I felt a whoosh of air, and then something heavy clubbed me in the head. The candle clattered onto the floor.

I turned around, and my heart, which had been thrashing in my chest like a wild animal from worry and paranoia, now came to a complete halt.

She towered over me, two or three times my height. Her belly was swollen, stretched beyond the normal limit, and I could see red veins bulging from arms that were as thick as tree trunks. She roared again, raised what I now recognized as an axe from the garage, and swung it down, nearly missing my head.

The table was cleanly split into half.

I backed away. She advanced, the axe swinging madly in her hands. At that same time the last of the sun slipped onto her face, and I nearly dropped everything I was so desperately holding.

“Maria?”

But it was not the Maria I knew. Her eyes were bloodshot. She moved, with an awkward clumsiness that did not seem like herself, and far below the treehouse I could see somebody waving their hands as if conducting a fancy orchestra.

Somebody with the body shape and size of a huge spider.

Somebody scuttling towards my direction.

I had ten seconds.

“Maria,” I choked out. “Please…”

She was almost on me now. She dropped the axe, and her hands crawled up to my throat. Her breath was on my face. I squirmed, but I was trapped under her grip. 

“Maria,” I hissed. “Fight it!”

“She never will.”

The voice was too familiar. Too small. Too much like that same little boy who could brighten my day just by walking into the room. 

The same boy who was wolfing down sausages this very morning with a big grin on his face.

*No!*

“Why, Uncle?” Junior drawled. His eyes gleamed red in the twilight. The crimson star was carved onto his chest, gleaming with blood.

He raised both his arms and Maria got off me and marched to his side. He advanced on me, his now-forked tongue flicking from side-to-side. 

“GET OUT OF MY NEPHEW!” I howled.

 My palms were sweating. I scrambled onto my feet, and forced myself to move.

“Get out of him?” Junior repeated mockingly. He cocked his head like he pretended not to understand, and then let out a large guffaw. 

“On the contrary, Uncle, I will have the joy of finishing you off myself. For everything you have done to us.”

I set the candle back on its stand and lit it. My hands were shaking so badly I was afraid I might accidentally burn this treehouse down. 

The flame went out feebly.

I struck another match.

“It is not working. Give up and come to me, Uncle. It will make things so much easier.”

*Come on, come on!* The flame was too weak. It went down slower and slower, and I bit my nails and held my breath.

Then it finally exploded into light, and the treehouse was bathed in orange and yellow and gold. Junior hissed in pain, and his eyes went wide. He backed quickly into the corner.

It was time. I lay my right hand onto him and placed my cross on his forehead. Junior screamed. Smoke was coming out from where the cross met skin.

Then, before I even started to pray, he dissolved into a mound of black ash. More rained down from the roof, flooding the treehouse, spilling over into the ground. I looked to my left and saw my wife was crumbling too, first her legs, belly, head. Blood gushed out and baked the ash into something hard.

I was left with the graves of the only family I had ever known. I knelt in front of them, and said a final goodbye, my tears falling like the ashes scattered around me. Then I wordlessly blew out the candle, climbed down the rope ladder and looked at the shadow of the treehouse for the last time.

Every step back to the main house was heavier than the last.

***
I stared at the flickering flames of the candle as the night danced on around me. I scrolled through my phone, staring at pictures of my family. Eating ice cream. Playing at the beach. Normal family stuff that made everything so worth it.

Until my life was ruined by the same thing I swore to protect them from.

My resolve hardened. And I made a promise, right then and there.

That I would fight the demons that haunted this world and send them back to where they came from. That no one else would get hurt.

And as if God himself was listening, the phone rang.

“Hello, is this Father Peter?”

It was a young woman, early twenties. Her voice sounded strained.

“My sister is here in my body and I can’t sleep any more. Get her out so we can both be at peace.”

“[Please…](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/xc9wos/everyone_thinks_i_killed_my_girlfriend_but_i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)”

“*Shut up, Cam. He can’t help you. Besides, you know you deserve it.*”

The line went dead. The lady—Cam—had sent an address. I gathered up my things and packed them into my knapsack.

Yes. Tonight will be a new night.

A night of change.

But as I strode down the road to take the first bus I felt something wake up inside me.

**Hello, Father Peter.**

I nearly dropped my things. I scanned the surroundings, my heart thumping away in my chest. Nothing.

Yeah. Maybe it was just the events of the night. Every little thing was making me jump. The sun began to rise, illuminating the silent forest around me.

Yeah.

There was nothing. Yet my heartbeat was quickening again. I couldn’t help but look around as I climbed the steps of the bus.

The voice gave out another hearty chuckle. Once again a shiver ran up my spine. My left hand was twitching involuntarily.

**I loved your nephew. And as for you…**

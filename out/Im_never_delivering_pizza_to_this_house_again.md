My name is Katy and I work at a small pizza place in Wisconsin. Business is usually pretty slow, especially late at night. I was the only one their, and was almost done closing up the place when a person called 1 minute before the business would close. I always hate it when people call last minute.

"Yankee's pizza, how can I help you?" I answered monotonously.

"Yes, I'd like a small pepperoni pizza." The man said rather quickly.

"Anything else?"

"No that should be all."

He seemed happy for some reason.

"Is this for delivery or pick-up"

"delivery...oh, and please, can you come inside and bring my pizza to me. I'm disabled and can't walk easily."

"Sure." I said.

I got his information and started making the pizza as quickly as I could. I put it in my car and started driving. I looked on google maps to try to find where he lived. His house was in the middle of nowhere on a dirt road. My phone said the estimated time was 15 minutes. Honestly I just wanted to go home. I had been working for 8 hours straight at that point and it was already past 10 o'clock.

It was always scary taking a delivery to a house in the middle of nowhere late at night, but nothing I hadn't done before.

I was getting close to his house. Just two more streets to go. I had a sudden bad feeling about it. Even though it was night, it seemed a lot darker than usual. I turned onto his driveway. It was long and narrow. In the distance I could see all the lights in his house were on. It's hard to put into words, but the environment just seemed spooky. *It's just another delivery* I kept telling myself. I parked my car, grabbed the pizza, and started walking towards his house. The house had a square foundation, and was very tall. It looked old, and the white paint was chipping off all over it. I walked up to the door and knocked.

"Come in." I here through the thick door.

I twisted the knob, and pushed on the door. It only opened slightly. On my second try I push much harder. It opened slightly more. I then push with almost all my force, and the door swung wide open almost making me fall.

"I'm upstairs." The man says casually as if he knew me.

I walked up the stairs. The man's was on his armchair watching tv on a box television. He looked to be about 200 pounds, probably in his 40s, and balding. One thing was sure to me: he wasn't disabled. His eyes couldn't stop moving. He seemed hyper. Something was off about him.

"here." I said as I handed him his pizza so fast I practically threw it. I then immediately started walking quickly toward the door.

"Well, aren't you going to let me pay for it?" He said.

I didn't even think of that. I just wanted to get out of their. Without saying a word I walked back to his armchair expecting him to pay for the pizza. He had a wide smile on his face. Their was silence between us for an uncomfortable amount of time as he maintained that smile.

*What was he smiling at*, I thought

"Can I help you?" I said.

Last thing I remember before I got knocked out was him quickly rising from his armchair. I woke up roped to a chair.

"You finally woke up." He said.

I felt sore and had a headache.

"I thought I was being too obvious but you fell right into my trap." he said.

"What do you want with me?" I asked aggressively.

He started to pace around the room slowly while he talked.

"Well, you see I'm very lonely, and have been for some time. I'll keep you alive and treat you well; that is if you will indulge me in a few of my fantasies."

I didn't know what to say. This man was psychotic. What were his "fantasies"?

"you monster!" I shouted. I instinctually tried to get out of my chair but the ropes were tied so tight it hurt.

"I waited until you were conscious for our first time." He said.

He started taking off my clothes. I was freaking out. An hour ago I was about to go home, but now I was trapped and helpless. He started doing nasty things that I couldn't recount even if I wanted too. I became an object of his pleasure for the next 2 hours. I cried and screamed the whole time. All my human dignity was taken away from me that night. His last words to me before he went to bed were "Good job; we'll see how you do tomorrow*."* I was tramatized. *How could someone be so evil?* I thought. Exhausted I slept right away. I woke up to fast and hard knocks at the door.

"This is the police, open up!!" I hear.

I was saved! I don't know how they found me, but I was saved! I started yelling to let the cops know I was in the house. I here the man running my way. He quickly grabbed a roll of duct tape and puts a piece of it over my mouth. I started to panic. I tried to make as much noise as I could with the tape over my mouth but I was hardly audible. The man dragged the chair I was tied to out of the living room and into a closet. The police began to violently pound on the door. The man went down the stairs and answered the door.

"Can I help you?" He said.

"We have a warrant for your arrest. Come with me." One of the police officers said. I think the man submitted because I didn't here another word from him.

I heard at least three police officers searching through the house. I tried to make noise, but couldn't. They eventually found me. They brought me to the police station, asked me a few questions, and then I went home. I try not to think about what happened that night, but it still haunts me. My message to anyone reading this is to stay safe. There are some messed up people out there.

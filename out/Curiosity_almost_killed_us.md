Have you ever felt that life is boring? We are always curious about things around us even if it is extremely dangerous. Me too this story happened a long time ago, but I still vividly remember that fateful day when we were so curious and then it almost took our lives. It was on a normal day at school, we were preparing for the upcoming summer vacation, me and 3 friends Celia, Jack, and Jimmy.

"Do you guys have any plans for the holiday?" I ask

“Not yet” Celia replied in a bored voice

We have been to almost everywhere from forests to beaches to even places that are said to be haunted, we have a common interest that is curiosity about the world around us, So we formed a group called "The Curious". While we were thinking about what to do on summer vacation instead of continuing to lie in bed and be exposed to social media, suddenly Jack said to us: "You guys want to go to a house Is it supposed to be haunted?"

"Come on we found out last time, it's just a hoax and just a waste of our time" Jimmy replied.

Last time we went to a house that was rumored to be haunted, but it was completely made up as we were there for an hour without any supernatural happening.

"Come on it's real this time" Jack said in an excited voice

"Anyway, it's better than lying in bed all day, isn't it?" Celia jokes

I agree with her, actually we did the same last year.

Jimmy sighed: "So where is it?" he asked

"Near a forest right on the hill, there is a house that is said to be haunted"

Needless to say, I was dumbfounded when I heard that, I knew that house. It is a house where a murder took place 5 years ago, the perpetrator has not been caught, a house of 5 fathers, mothers and 2 children, within one night 4 people died. and 3 children, people still think that the father is the culprit who caused this just because he disappeared 1 day before the date of the crime. Aware of the danger that might be lurking, but I still can't get rid of the thought, is it really haunted?, who really killed them that day? After thinking for a long time, I decided to go there with the group to investigate

"Then next Sunday right before the woods we'll meet there, I'm looking forward to it" Celia replied excitedly.

"I'm looking forward to it too" I thought in my head

But what we don't know is that a tragedy awaits us

And that day also came, we met there

"Where's Jack?" I ask everyone

"Not yet," replied Jimmy

"Did he call us here and stay at home until we get back and tell him? Traitor" Celia said in an angry voice

"haha" i laughed lightly

"Let's go there first" I said

"BOO" Jack came out from the bushes

We backed away in shock and fell backwards

Jack laughed like crazy after scaring us he said we should see our faces after that

"At least you came" I said

"Of course I was excited and got there before everyone else" replied Jack while still smiling

Then we went to that house, it was more like a mansion, surrounded by old police tapes and paint stains on the house. A chill touched the nape of my neck, and I expressed uneasiness but still couldn't resist my curiosity.

"Wow, it looks scarier than the places we've been before, doesn't it?" Jimmy opened his eyes wide and said

"Let's go in" Celia said

She brought 4 flashlights and 1 pistol in case something bad happened

Jack came to the door of the house and gave it a little shake and said, "It's locked."

"It's okay, find another way" Celia replied

We walked around and found an open window

"Fortunately" Celia smiled

By this time my insecurities became even bigger and my curiosity didn't stop

"Let's go inside to see if there's anything" Jack replied

"I have a bad feeling" Jimmy said

Turns out he had a bad premonition just like me

"Whatever you can wait outside or someone will see you?" Jack jokes

Jimmy was also afraid of turning pale so he had no choice but to follow us inside

"WOW, that's wide" Celia was amazed

Jack started rummaging around, then asked to give him a hand

"It's like we're stealing" I said

"Whatever, if I find something of value, I won't share it" Jack replied

"Whatever" I replied

After walking around for a while we found a family photo that used to own the house, it was a black and white photo with 5 people but the strange thing is why the father's face is missing, not only that We also found a letter near a drawer that read:

"Baby, I know we're having a hard time and this can make you and the kids unhappy but there's no other choice then don't worry I'll take you and the kids to bed then we'll get there a place where there are no more problems." The clues became more and more clear that it was the father who killed them, only we didn't know his face but hey because most of the family photos were lost and there was one of us. found his face ripped off.

"So it's clear, isn't it?" Jimmy said in a trembling voice

"Let's go" Jack said

jimmy and I both wanted to retreat but didn't have the courage to do so just because we were so scared that someone would find us if we went out now so we went with them, we decided to go to the next floor to find next. We entered the room a stench hit our noses

"What the fuck" Celia covered her nose and grimaced

In front of us appeared to be the corpse of a deer, it had been dissected and there were a lot of worms eating its intestines what was worse was that it had its head cut off. After looking around I'm sure this is the place where the 2 children died because of the smudges around there, ignoring that stinky room we entered the father and mother's room, nothing much There was also only a faint chalk stain on the bed indicating that she was murdered in her sleep, after searching and finding nothing, we decided to leave when we went downstairs and discovered a basement.

"Who knows..." "NO" Celia was just interrupted by Jimmy

"I've had enough and we've got nothing and another waste of time, that's exactly what I said at the beginning, besides it's already starting to get dark if we don't get back in time we'll have to wait. against a real monster" said Jimmy furiously

"Well then, then get the hell out of here and get out of my sight" Celia replied

Then Jimmy decided to leave

"You guys won't leave me, right?" Celia looks at us

"maybe Jimmy was right here there's nothing but animal carcasses and stench" Jack replied sadly

"Whatever you cowards do" she angrily dropped into the basement

We could only see her slowly entering the darkness until her figure was completely engulfed in darkness. We walked out to find Jimmy sitting on the swing and looking at us with sad eyes.

"Where is she ?" Jimmy asked

"You know that" Jack replied

Jimmy just sat there in awe and told us to wait for her. After an hour of waiting, we heard gunshots from inside the house and Celia's voiceless scream

"what the fuck" Jack rolled his eyes

Me and everyone rushed towards Jimmy's house and pulled out a gun prepared in advance

After diving into the cellar we found Celia, but

"She's dead" Jack looked at her with wide, unblinking eyes

She died tragically, she was stabbed through the head with a spear, she lost one eye and was still bleeding while her other eye was wide open as seen. Such a horrible thing

"What the hell happened?" Jimmy asked panicking

We can only be dumbfounded because no one knows what really happened

"Let's get out of here, hurry" I said hastily through tears

When we found our way out, we were chilled to see a woman's organs removed, the stench started to rise, Jack vomited, but for our lives we had to keep going. we got to a room where there were a lot of skinned corpses and an empty stomach on a table full of knives even saws and surgical tools Jimmy started to shake and was about to cry .

"Who the fuck did this shit ?" Jack said tremblingly

We opened a box where the body parts and organs were still covered with blood, the stench of blood hit our noses, we quickly closed the box and left. Next, we got lost in this damn cellar with the stinking corpses. Suddenly, there were footsteps approaching, we quickly hid in a cupboard containing the dead body of a young boy, looking through the gap, it was a large man holding a head and the other. holding a headless corpse we quickly recognized it as Celia's. He started his dissection, and we stood helplessly watching Celia's organs being pulled out one by one. After ten minutes of nothing left of her body, he started whistling the tune of a recent up-and-coming song. We quickly got out and found the exit 

But it's not that simple, when we got to the door, a knife went straight into Jack's hand, he fell down in pain. Behind, it was that perverted killer, he wore a wolf mask covered in blood, and rushed towards us, Jimmy quickly pulled out his gun and shot him in the leg and told everyone to hurry up. go, he's too scared to pull the trigger to finish him off so you can only run as fast as we can.

After running out of the forest, a lot of police stood there and stormed back into that house, we were saved this time, but Celia wasn't so lucky.

As soon as the story was spread to the press and the media quickly reported it, they discovered a cellar full of corpses and organs, but unfortunately the killer escaped. We were questioned all day that day, after there was nothing left to say we were released. Celia's family was devastated when we heard the news, we just stood there watching while also in tears because of what we had witnessed.

After we got home, Dad ran out and hugged me tightly and told me not to do that next time. My father is a doctor, he often comes home late because of complicated surgeries. But then I realized he had given first aid to the wound on his thigh, then he told me there was work in the basement and told me not to go down there, I could only obey and tell him:

"Dad should clean the basement, it smell so bad, it's like you always going to the toilet down there"

He just laughed and said he would do so while going down to the basement, it seems I don't become curious anymore after all that .

I can hear him mumbling something about Celia

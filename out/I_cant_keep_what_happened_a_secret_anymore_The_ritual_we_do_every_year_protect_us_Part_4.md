I know… it’s been a while. Thinking about what happened in the library triggers me in such a way that it makes my brain start to… short circuit. I can’t really make sense of it all, but I need to try to tell and explain. I’m not crazy. I’m not crazy. I’m not crazy.

We walked past the praying wretch. Down another corridor that seemed to disappear around us as we got further, and further away from the light of that friar’s dim candles. The area beneath the church was starting to feel much larger than it should’ve been, while feeling too closed in all at once. As an old cop, I thought that nothing could surprise me anymore… but I was wrong. Ever since that fucked up night, I’ve felt lost in the world. And the feelings of disorientation I was getting inside the catacombs reminded me of that.

When the candles’ reach from that unholy shrine finally disappeared into nothingness behind us, the old man stopped walking and I heard the sound of a match. A dull glow started to seep out from the priest’s skeletal fingers, his hands looked like bones wrapped in paper as the light passed through his frail skin. Somehow, the tiny spark turned into the crackling flame of a brazer on the ground next to us. And suddenly… from what I could make out through the shadows, we were surrounded by rotting scrolls stacked up all around us.

He started talking again. His voice sounding closer to death than that of life, like a man that had been lost in a desert with no water. Sounds coming from a dry place, a loud whisper of a groan that reminded me of the crumblings of dead leaves.

“We are here. Blessed be the blood of the lord. Blessed be the tears of God, that we may drink and be replenished.

This is the bibliotheca silentii, my son. Through these texts we have found a balance and learned the importance of silence to find God and grow in his wisdom. But… we have also found many other things—things that should never be found. Language is power and names are keys. The death of old tongues was never a mistake, but an attempt at separating our world from what was forgotten… God’s will.

There is more to this world than just heaven and hell; and there is more to hell than a devil and his demons. For even the word ‘Demon’ is a lie, for if we were to speak their true names on our tongues, they would latch onto our breath, climb into our bellies and our souls would fester.”

I looked around. And as my eyes slowly adjusted, I thought that I could see something else in the darkness. You know when you close your eyes after you shut all your lights off in your room at night? You see random colors floating, swirling, flashing dots flickering in and out of existence in a sea of velvet black—well, it was like that but—I could’ve sworn that these swirls were twisting into screaming faces, like the patterns weren’t so random or something. Fuck—Maybe I do need the medication.

He went on. His decrepit voice echoing throughout the chamber as he slowly read through the decaying scrolls, speaking in a tongue that was foreign to me. His speech sounded like a sharp gibberish, unlike any language I’ve ever heard before… but all the words made sense still. Each syllable painfully scratching images into my imagination in the form of memories that I’ve never experienced. But could recall upon as if I’d been there anyway. My mind trapped within his grasp, being pulled into the past in order to recapture, revisit and re-experience moments long lost to the flowing currents of time.

The light from the fire seemed to get sucked back into the brazer, and I was frozen. All the while, I felt like I was moving through a tunnel of inky black space. None of it made sense. Yet—all of it made sense.

All of a sudden I was in the middle of a field surrounded by rows of turnips. The wind was crisp and the sky was painted in flame. Whether it was sunrise or sunset, I did not know. But the sun was low to the horizon, and an eternal sea of twilight was overhead. Beads of water covered the leaves of the plants, and the scent of men filled the air. I looked around and didn’t see another soul but couldn’t shake the feeling that I wasn’t alone.

I started walking through the field, holding my arms out so that my fingers would comb though the oddly tall leaves of the turnip plants. When I put my wet hands to my face… it wasn’t the scent of fresh rain, or morning dew—but instead the smell of sweat. The eyes I was trapped behind started to close and I felt a, sick, twisted smile come into my face. But in my own mind I was disgusted.

When the eyes opened again, I was in a candle lit cabin room filled with faceless women. The fronts of their heads just featureless mounds of flesh; a layer of skin moving back and forth, ballooning and deflating where their mouths should’ve been. As if they were trying to breath—but couldn’t. And they were crying. All of them, including myself, frantically carving eyes, noses and lips into dried up roots with cut up, bloody fingers. Until one of the roots bit me and I knocked over a candle.

Flames quickly caught onto my thick dress and the straw beneath my feet; it was in that moment that I realized that I too was female. My body jumped up in a panic and tried desperately to put out the loose fire, but the flame continued to spread. All the faceless women around me continued to carve, even as the inferno started to consume their dresses and eventually their flesh as well. Smoke replaced the air and the lids shut themselves over my eyes tightly again, while the smell of burning human meat filled my nostrils.

The sounds of crying and screaming slowly transformed into the melodies of laughter and singing. When my eyes were forced open again, I had something sweet being pushed into my mouth; while chanting and dancing around in a circle with children. All our heads covered in burlap sacks as we frolicked around a woman burning on a stake. We sang in a language foreign to me, but the lyrics seemed familiar and old to me none the less.

As I tried to pay more attention to my surroundings, I noticed that I was head level with the rest of the children. And the sweets being pushed into my mouth was being helped along by a tiny hand—my own. The more we danced, the more I noticed a pattern. The steps of our feet dug a circle and star into dirt around the woman burning in agony. And we were happy.

As my eyes started to close again once more, I started to peer deeper into the flames, and I could see the woman’s burning face start to crack into a smile. I could see another type of light start to dribble out from her burned, hollowed out eye sockets.

An evil… yellow… light.

I could see the dark bright billowing out from within her mouth—along with long, inhuman, black finger-like things reaching… clawing. Slowly bending like the limbs of a spider, grasping upon cooking human flesh. And then my eyes closed again.

I woke up laying on the ground in puddle of viscous liquid. Gasping for air and choking on smoke. The old priest was standing over me, staring down at me in silence as I tried to get used to my own body again.

I was back in the library.

After I gained my composure, I got  up off the ground. Everything was back to normal. If you could consider any of this shit normal. Or at least… I thought. The priest didn’t move. And his skin looked more like papier-mâché than it had before. At first, I wanted to punch him in the face, even though that might have killed him. Fucking old piece of shit… but the more I looked at him, the more dead he seemed to be.

He was breathing, but his breaths were shallow. His eyes looked dry and stuck to his lids. And that’s when I seen it. A bug. A single insect crawled out his mouth, across his face and under his eye lid. He didn’t move. And then something else happened.

I started to see the light. The light was coming from within his mouth. I immediately pulled out my sidearm and shot him in his fucking face. Fuck that. He lived a long enough life anyway.

Before I knew it, I was hastily moving back out through the path that had led me into that deep, dank place. But as I put space between me and that old corpse, I could hear inhuman things—things that sounded like gasping, but from too many throats. All of them too dry. And I could see a dull yellow glow growing slowly from within the library as quickly made my way back towards the entrance.

The rusty gate was wide open and no one was there. Just a bloody looking crucifix and freshly lit candles. I made my way back though the catacombs, following the flow of that putrid liquid running through the open drainage system and the illumination of my flashlight. I walked up the spiral stairs, and when I got to the top, everyone in the church was staring at me with blank faces. Some of them with open mouths.

When I finally made it back outside, I saw that it was the middle of the night. I had no idea that much time had passed. But I was glad to be above ground and out of that fucked up place.

After getting back to my car, I noticed some sort of pastry resting on my driver’s seat. It was a small round cake with an “X” baked into it. There was dried fruit on the top of it as well—it almost looked like flesh. I slapped it onto the wet ground on the parking lot and drove off.

As I cruised down that lonely road through a valley of endless trees, I knew what I had to do next. I understood what couldn’t be described in any language that was present in the world today. I felt like I had bore witness to something long forgotten in time. I felt like I had seen Samhain—lived it… and the weakening of the veil. I felt like I had taken part in an ancient ritual. I felt like it was a part of me now.

I know what I must do… I’m not crazy.

To be continued…

My name is Crain, and  I have gotten myself in a terrible situation in which I'm likely to die. This all started when I wanted to go urban exploring with a close friend of mine. His name is Matt and we have been friends since we were young so, naturally, we stayed close friends throughout our lives. We are currently young adults and our main job is just a call center job but at least we get to stay home.

It was about a week ago when Matt brought up going urban exploring... or urban spelunking? I can't recall since it's rather cold in the meat locker I am trapped in. I digress, he brought this up to me and sounded super excited.

Matt: "Hey man, I want to know if you are willing to go urban exploring with me? I have already bought a ton of gear and I know an interesting place downtown in the industrial district!"

Me: "I don't know man... isn't that shit kinda illegal? Sounds fun but I'd rather not be sent to jail over dumb shit."

Matt: "Bro, I promise you we won't get caught! I got a foolproof plan that gets us in and out without being detected."

Me: "Soooo It IS illegal? How about you come over today and we can discuss it here and not over the phone"

Matt: "Bet, imma take that as a yes! I'll be there in like 10 minutes"

I sat back down and waited to watch the news. 

News Anchor: "A  young couple goes missing today with most neighbors stating they went for a morning jog and never came back" 

Me: "I'm sure they are just walking about" 

News Anchor: "This would be the third..." 

Before the news anchor could finish I heard a loud knock at the door. I walked to the door and looked through the peephole and didn't see my friend however, there was a letter in a red envelope placed on the floor in front of my door. I opened the door and looked to my left and right down the hall of the apartment complex. No one was there so whoever it was either walks fast or ran. Anyhow, I picked the envelope up and closed my door.

The envelope itself was made of very fine and thin paper and a wax seal was keeping it closed. The symbol of the wax was shaped like a crescent moon with tiny stars scattered throughout. I was about to open it and see what was inside when I heard another knock on the door. So I put the envelope in my pocket to look through the peephole once again.

I saw Matt standing there with two backpacks and a rolled-up piece of paper. I opened the door and let him in.

Matt: "Bro... Bro, there is some crazy shit I found on the internet about this place. Turns out it was a meat processing plant and was shut down due to three on-site deaths all involving employees being grounded up when they accidentally slipped into the large grinder they had. So after three, the state forced them to shut down. People say It's haunted or some shit."

Me: "I mean that's fucked up. Sounds cool to check it out. Also bro you know ghosts don't exist right?"

Matt: "Of course man I'm just letting you know what I found. Oh, also they had a full blueprint at the county clerk's office. I just lied and said I was an independent contractor going to fix a leak. Wasn't even asked to show proof. Ah, good ole' America."

We sat down at my table in the living room and we talked about where to get in and how to get in. He bought bolt cutters for any major locks. We went over what we had.

. Two helmets with GoPros attached.

. Two  boxes  of granola bars

. Ten bottles of water each

. His laptop

. And a portable wifi hotspot with 10GB of an internet plan.

. First aid kit

. Heavy-duty work gloves

This was everything we had including the backpacks of course. We thought we were ready and made up a time to meet each other at a Mcdonald's near the area. After Matt has left I sat down to turn on the tv. I remembered that I had stuffed that envelope into my pocket. I pulled it out and opened it. Inside was a brown slip of paper addressed to me.

Dear Mr. Crain

The company wanted to inform you that "We Know"

Sincerely,  √Åtahsaia

What an odd letter but I couldn't just dismiss it... goosebumps raised on my arms and I started to sweat. It was as if every fiber of my being was warning to not to go. I crumpled the paper and threw it in the trash then walked to my bed to lay down. I tried to sleep it off but the overwhelming dread made it so hard to fall asleep. Eventually, after enough tossing and turning, I was able to get some rest.

I was woken up by the sudden banging on the door to my room. I could hear a fighting voice from behind the door. As I stared intently I could hear ... whatever was scratching behind the door. After what seemed like a few seconds, I could hear its voice and what it was saying.

"Be Not Afraid."

The voice became thunderous ... It felt as if my soul was shaking to the core. It sounded as if a rusty can was being scraped with a fork. I could hear horns.. 5? 6? no it was 7! Before I could react, a ball of wings and spinning disks covered in ... eyes? The strange mass came hovering toward me with its very presence bending reality around it. All I could hear is the sounds of the horns and its voice.

"Fear not, for I am with you; be not dismayed, for I am your God; I will strengthen you, I will help you, I will uphold you with my righteous right hand."

It was then I sat up screaming and everything went to normal. I was sweating and shaking but I felt no fear only ... comfort. My phone started buzzing and when I checked it was Matt texting me to come downstairs. When I got there he waved me down and we spoke a little before getting in the car and driving to the place.

Me: "What happened to meeting at Mcdonald's?"

Matt: "I thought carpooling would be better, to be honest."

We parked about half a mile from the warehouse and walked to the front gate of the building. Matt pulled out the bolt cutters and clipped the lock which was just a simple padlock. We opened the gate and I immediately felt an overwhelming presence bearing down on me. As if someone had a knife to my throat. I assumed this was about my nightmare last night so I took a deep breath in a feeble attempt to soothe myself.

Matt didn't notice what I was feeling which I assumed he didn't. We got to the door and it was... immaculate. As if it was frozen in time. Walking through the factory floor and there were a few of those large grinders left. They were clean and looked brand new.

Matt: "Hey, look what I found here. It's a shredded piece of cloth."

Me: "What if that belongs to one of the three people who died here."

Matt: "Na, they would've cleaned all that up by now."

Me: "Well I wouldn't touch it, to be honest" 

Matt drops the cloth where it was and we proceeded to walk down the line. It seemed like we were just there but when we arrived it was 9 am and what felt like 10 minutes later it was already 5 pm and the sun was getting ready to set. The crickets were chirping and frogs croaking. The room dropped in temperature drastically giving Matt and me goosebumps. We silently looked at each other thinking how odd this all was. We both agreed to go back as we were both freaking out. However, what cemented our wanting to leave was when we heard the machines firing. The loud churning of rusty gears and clanking of old metal. 

Me: "Matt, This place doesn't have power... the county clerk said this"

Before I could look toward Matt he was frozen in fear as behind the machine was a large, burly man with a pig's head grafted in place of his own. This man was impossibly large, I would say about 13 Ft tall. We didn't know what to do but stood there paralyzed with fear. This massive creature slowly compared toward us. Each step it took felt heavier the normal as it shook the ground we stood on. I was able to snap out of my trance and I shook Matt to escape. We ran to the front door and swung it open as fast as we could however... it was all bricked up... someone or something isn't letting us go... 

The creature was very slow but ever-present. Any time we felt like we lost and outran it we would hear it walking around the corner as if it just teleported there. Matt and I kept running for what seemed like hours. As we outran the thing again we stopped to take a breath and drink some water. And there it comes walking around the corner. I put my bottle away and motioned Matt to come with me. 

I tried lifting myself up but instantly crumpled back down. My body was exhausted and Matt and I couldn't move. The giant man came stomping toward us slowly and picked up Matt first while I lay there. I watched in horror as placed Matt on a large, rusty meat hook. The Hook went through his neck and blood started to spray everywhere. I watched as this butcher grabbed a cleaver and started to flay Matt in front of me. Making pig noises while tearing his flesh from his muscles. After Matt was skinned alive the pig started to cut him down the center disemboweling him in the process. What was left of my best friend lay in a pile of guts and skin... 

The room was filled with the smell of blood and viscera. I could barely hold back my vomit as the pig started to pull each tendon from his bone. Each muscle removed made a terrible snapping sound almost like a rubber band breaking. I couldn't take it anymore as every fiber of my being is telling me to run, to hide ... to Survive! I snapped as adrenaline pumped and I was able to lift myself and run. 

I could hear a mixture of laughing and pig squealing in the background but I kept going not risking looking back. It was there when I saw it. A large fridge-like locker with two heavy-duty doors. I opened it up and slammed the doors shut. Inside I looked around for anything that can stop this thing. I looked down and saw a loose pipe that wasn't connected to anything. I yanked on it with all my might and snapped its rusty bolts. I could hear the pig large feet slapping against the concrete floor. I had to act quickly so I lodged the pipe between the two door handles effectively locking it. 

I can hear the pig shake the door violently squealing and cursing me in a deep raspy voice. I sighed in relief. I sat back down this time covering all I can with my backpack. Looking around I saw 2 more people who were "prepped" already. A young woman and a young man. I would freak out but I was too exhausted to scream.

And now I'm here... I can hear the pig pacing back and forth in front of the door giggling and snorting... I don't have much battery left so I hope I can find a miracle.

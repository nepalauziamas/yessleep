**BZZZZZ**

Try having that sound wake you up. The way the metal screeches as it spins. Try having THAT wake you up, and then realize you’re bare-ass naked and restrained to a chair.

What would you be feeling? What would you do? Would you struggle; maybe try to get free? Would you cry, piss yourself and beg for mercy? *Heh... that’s funny... ‘mercy’.*

Well, Let me tell you right now, you do any of those, and you’d have only sped up your death. Whether or not that’s part of your intended goal, well...

I say all of this because that’s exactly the situation I was in at one point. Tied to a chair, ball-gagged, with my wrists and ankles tied, pulling them in about four separate directions. Right in front of my face, as well as directly *behind* my head, were two fully automated buzz saws.

They spun furiously. The screeching metal damn near made me go deaf. I stayed still. I knew one move forward or backward and that was it; I’d be ground meat.

Staring directly into the one in front of me, it almost looked like it was actually moving, inching its way closer and closer. I knew it wasn’t, but that’s eyesight for you, isn’t it? Always playing tricks, trying to get you to flinch. *Trying to make you move...*

I stayed still, though. I’d seen what happened to the others at this stage. Others who couldn’t take it, who couldn’t handle staring death right in his screaming metal face like this, only inches away from their own. I wasn’t gonna make that mistake, though. I couldn’t.

*I had to get out of this alive...*

The saws continued spinning for another three and a half minutes, teasing me, before suddenly powering down. For a second after that, I stayed stiff in the chair, holding my breath. My heart was pumping like 10,000 horsepower engine. My eyes were concentrated on the saw blade as it slowed until finally stopping. That’s when I finally, slowly, started to exhale and relax in the chair.

Let me ask you something; have you ever felt, after something so exciting or exhilarating happened to you, that when things start to settle back down to normal, it actually takes a minute for you to process reality again? What I mean is, have you felt like the world wasn’t real for a while afterwards; after everything goes suddenly quiet after being so loud for so long? Like you’re in another world, or another *life* even?

Well, whether YOU have or not, that’s what it felt like to me. Everything was quiet, still, like nothing was there. *Like I hadn’t been so close to death.*

I moved my eyes around, sporadically scanning the dingy white bricked walls. On one of them were the words **”Nothing to Fear, but fear itself”**. Under this was a giant yellow smiley face that grinned teasingly at me. It looked like it found me damn near being turned into choice cuts was the funniest thing it’d ever seen. *The way it saw the others as well.*

*The way THEY see us.*

I looked then to the wall at my right, seeing the tinted, bulletproof window. I couldn’t see anything or anyone from my end, but that wasn’t the case for them. They saw everything and anything. They watched from that window, savoring every moment with a shit-eating smile at least as big, if not bigger, than the face on the fuckin’ poster.

Eventually the light clicked on from the other side and I saw her, Director Web. At least, that’s what she likes us to call her. God only knew if that was her *actual* name. It didn’t matter though. We, of course, had a different name for her anyway, a simpler one; “Bitch Widow”. She wore a black crop top and tight leather shorts with fishnet stockings. She dressed like this for two reasons, first being because, according to what I’d heard, she used to be a prostitute. The second, though, was so she could show off her spiderweb tattoo on her stomach.

It was her signature. Her trademark. Her display of dominance. You saw that, and you saw *her*; and then you prayed for whatever mercy you could. She stood with her thumb over a button.

"That get your blood flowin', tiger?" she said in a smooth voice through the intercom at the top left corner of the room. I stared at her coldly for a solid minute. She smirked. "You're a quiet little bastard, I'll give you that much." I saw her step to the right and begin fiddling with, what I *guess,* was some kind of control panel or something. Suddenly, I watched the saw blade mechanisms start to retract into the walls.

"Well, in any case, congratulations. You'll progress to the next round." She then clicked a button mounted on the side of the wall on her end. "Sweet dreams, Tiger." she said with a wink. In *maybe* two seconds, my eyes became heavy and the room felt like it was spinning. Then, everything was dark.

I didn't dream. Honestly, I'd never really been one *to have* dreams, good or bad. Well, not like what most people say they have, anyways. I DO see things in my sleep. It's always the same thing.

**\*\*\***

I see the faces of  my fiancé Vanessa, as well as my best friend, Brent. That's it, just their faces; smiling, laughing. *Screaming.*

I don't have any sort of vivid scenes play out or anything, either. No, it's just their faces staring back at me, reminding me of why I have to make it out of this freakshow alive. Its what's kept me strong thus far, what's gotten me this far through the game.

*Ironic really...*

**\*\*\***

I awoke sometime -- don't even bother asking me *how much* \-- later, sitting up on the cot in my little holding cell. I couldn't go back to sleep, so I just laid, looking up at the ceiling. The dark, ash grey ceiling that had bits of worn paint dangling down from places where it'd began flaking. Sometimes I'd see this, too, in my sleep. Sort of a way of contrasting; the faces of my loved ones being the light at the end of the tunnel, while the weathered, decaying ceiling; the lifeless brick walls, acted as the reminder of what awaited me if I failed. It was the good and the bad. Hope and despair. *Heaven and Hell...*

At the time, I thought this gave me an edge. That I was lucky, having something to fight for, something to lose. Like I said, I used it to fuel me as I endured one fucked up round after another. Looking up at the ceiling, I couldn't help but wonder what some of the others felt. Others, most of which *hadn't* progressed as far as I had at the time. I wondered who or what *they* were doing this for, if anybody. What did *they* have?

That I think of it now, though, I’m honestly not sure whether or not they were luckier for it; not making it as far as I did. I had something to lose, yes, but that made things only more painful for me later on. It made everything hurt much worse physically, too, as I continued the game. Like I said; ironic.

*“Fear itself, the greatest obstacle of man.”* I remember hearing on the advertisements that promoted all of this. *“Can it truly be overcome?”*

I’ll tell you this much, there are FAR better ways to find out the answer to this question. It didn’t need a team of egghead scientists with a big ass facility like this; like Monolith, to answer this by concocting this “game.” They actually call it a “game”, you know, like we’re too stupid to know what it *actually* is. Like we’d be naive enough to not realize that we’re not people to them, but monkeys; test monkeys for them to watch get mauled physically, emotionally, and mentally in some of the worst ways imaginable.

Of course, what we *didn’t* know, was why they were pursuing this in the first place. Why “overcoming fear” was so important to them. I know *I* didn’t. Not like I really cared.

*So long as she’s okay...*

I heard the intercom blare. An announcement was about to be made by the ‘Bitch Widow’.

***”ATTENTION! ATTENTION! Five more contestants have made the cut to the next round! Contestants A, C, V, and U, and Z, congratulations, you’ll all be progressing to the Nexus rounds! Sadly, some of your peers weren’t so lucky...”***

Sounds of crowd disappointment played before continuing with ***”Guess they just didn’t have the guts!”*** This was followed with sounds of laughter. *I’ll bet that* ***was*** *funny to them.*

***”Contestants D, E, and F will be progressing to the ‘Danger floor’ in two hours. As for our ‘Nexus Round’ competitors, rest up, enjoy whatever dreams you can because our next round will begin right after.”***

The intercom went out after that. I laid back on my cot, staring once more at the depressing ceiling; my metaphor of Hell. I laughed hollowly. It was funny to me. I was slated to head to ‘The Danger Floor’. ‘The Danger Floor’, as if nowhere else in this place could’ve been nicknamed that and it still fit just as perfectly.

I mean, for Christ sake, the *FIRST* level; ‘The Cradle’ they called it, was a series of tasks ranging from finding a crying babydoll in a web of razor wire, withstanding a heated room that escalated in temperature that maxed out (at least I THINK maxes out) at 10,000 Fahrenheit. And lest I forget the ‘Serpent’s den’, where I was forced to lie bare ass naked in den of squirming cobras for ten minutes straight without so much as flinching or else I’d be impaled by the serrated needles that were positioned only half an inch above me. If you thought it didn’t get worse from there, then you’re a fuckin’ moron; a naive, optimistic moron.

**\*\*\***

Just like I was when I signed up for this. I thought things couldn’t be worse. I thought the worst it could get was when Vanessa got sick. Stage 2 Liver Cancer, as well as ulcers in her lower intestine. Doctor’s said that it’s unlikely there’s any real way to treat it thanks to the ulcers.

That, to me, as it would probably be to *most* people, was the worst possible thing to hear. What was worse, of course, was that we didn't have a whole lot of money to even properly feed ourselves and keep the roof of our cramped one-bedroom apartment over our heads; *MUCH* less be able to afford medical treatment (*Especially not if funeral expenses were not long to follow)*. My dead-end job as a bouncer at the bar was also circling the drain at the time as well, which would've meant soon, I wouldn't even have *that* to rake anything from for her. In short, the love of my life was dying and I needed a fuckin' miracle to save her.

Then I'd find out about all of this. It was from a patron at the bar who I'd never seen around before. Keep in mind, the town I'm from is relatively small. I could tell you where at least half the residents lay their heads down at night and what time. I say that much to say that, yeah, it wasn't usual for me to see a new face; an outsider, coming into the bar.

What was even further out of the ordinary was the way the guy actually looked. To give you a reference of what I mean by this; Imagine just about any seedy-looking biker bar you've seen in movies, you know the type. Dark, dusty wooden walls, two or three tables, two others on the side near the champagne room in the back that were booth seats, and the jukebox by the door that, if we were lucky, would work once every two or three months. Now take this and imagine the type of people you'd think come through there on a regular basis.

I bet a young, nerdy looking kid in shades and a black dress shirt isn't what you were picturing. It wasn't what *I* was expecting anyway, like I said. But there he was, plopped on a barstool next to me. I was, for reasons already stated, plus the general bullshit from work that night, losing myself with shot after shot of Jack. It wasn't working though.

It's probably a safe bet to say I wasn't doing real good at hiding it, either. At least, judging by the fact that, the next thing I knew, he turns to me and asks me if I needed a "Life-changing phenomenon". I remember looking back at him (probably sloshed by that point) and wondering what to say or do. For one thing, it was abrupt when he said it. Completely unprovoked. I'd not, at least that I was aware of, made any attempts at trying to engage in conversation or even look in his direction before. In other words, in my eyes, he really had no reason to be interacting with me.

The other thing was the excited, sort of laid back tone he took when he asked this. He sounded like he was about to rail on about some new thing that was on the market or something, the same way kids nowadays do when they're gawking about some new viral video. He was gauging me, essentially. He had a purpose, and for some reason, he though it'd be something I would be interested in knowing about. Well, I guess that joke's all on me for thinking otherwise when he told me that I'd have the chance for 50 grand.

Obviously, my first thoughts were a combination of "What the fuck is he talking about?" and "Is this kid serious here?" I voiced neither of these at the time, though. Aside from the liquor setting in, making it hard to really try thinking real deep into anything, I was also just generally not in the mood to hear his or anyone else's horseshit. I had far more than enough of my own damn problems to be trying to hear this no-name kid's propaganda too. I was like this, too, when I heard him start railing for the next ten minutes about this contest to or "Tournament", as he kept calling it, thinking it made it sound more "hip" or "cool". It didn't, but far be it from me to have given enough of a rat's ass at the time to actually tell him that.

"So whaddya say?" he asked, "You think you got the guts?"

I remember looking at him and going “huh? What?” Again, I’d only heard about half of what he was going on about. I heard the parts about it being a tournament to see if someone could “conquer all fear” or something to that effect. Anything beyond that scope, though, such as any sort of explanation for what the fuck that meant or how it worked, was pretty much lost on me entirely. I wasn’t gonna ask, either, though, he wouldn’t give me a choice in the matter.

I tried to make it as clear as possible (or at least I thought I was) that I wasn’t interested. Still, though he kept pushing me about it. He made the usual claims about “no one’s ever made it before.” “No one’s got the guts to go till the end.”

That was another line he seemed to like repeating. “No one’s got the guts to make it till the end.” Funny, isn’t it, just how much that line fits, I guess to his credit. I didn’t see any of that at the time, though. No, I just rolled my eyes and downed my last shot of Jack for the night. I was turning to leave for the night; back to the apartment where I'd likely either toss and turn all night or cry myself to sleep (whichever'd come last I guess), when he thrusted a business card at me, as well as pay off my, albeit pretty hefty ass, tab.

Funny as this sounds, him doing that actually helped ignite my interest in his little pitch. See, by that point, I'd ran up a good $700 - $750 tab. Again, for obvious reasons, I couldn't pay that easily. Not without *months* of major cuts taken from my paycheck. But this kid just went and covered it all in one fell swoop.

"Heeeyy kkid," I slurred. He turned to me, noticeably parting the left corner of his lip. "Wheeerrree yyooouu ggeeett tthh-aaat kin'a mmonney ffrroom?" He didn't reply. Instead, he just pointed to the business card in my hand and winked before getting up and leaving himself.

I just stood there (as steadily as I could, anyway), wondering now how this kid could've had that kind of money just on hand like that. That would, inevitably, lead me to start thinking how *I'd* be able to make this kind of money. Money that I'd be able to put towards Vanessa's treatment. Hell, with any luck, I supposed the money could've also helped us *afterwards* as well when she recovered. She could come out of the hospital, refreshed and new, and we could take a vacation up to the mountains like we'd been wanting to. No, we could *move* to the mountains like she'd wanted to.

That's what led me that night to come home and search up the information listed on the card. The card itself was plain, having only listed a website address and a sort of logo of a large black block or stone with the words **"Monolith Corp."** written in bold, yet still tiny as all hell lettering under it. I wasn't sure how much I expected to find, but I'll say that it was at least a *little* more than just a single website.

Well, I say "website", but it wasn't even *that* much. Clicking the link directed me to a page with a single pop-up that read in bold red lettering that was designed to look like it was bleeding, like how commercials do on Halloween, **"CAN YOU BEAT YOUR FEAR? FEAR, THE GREATEST OBSTACLE OF MAN, CAN IT BE OVERCOME!"**

Below were listed three more things: an address and a time, as well as the aforementioned $50,000 which was actually slightly bigger in size compared to the rest of the text. The time was listed for 11:00 A.M. that Saturday morning. That was it, no other details, contact information, trailers, instructions, or even any pictures about the event or whatever the fuck it was anywhere; nothing. Now I'll bet you're thinking that I had a lick of damn sense enough to close the page, throw away the card, and just go to bed, right?

Well... I said it before; the joke was on me. I threw the card away and closed the page, sure, but that wasn't the end of it. I mean, I think I've made it clear that, yeah, I was desperate. Wouldn't you be? Out of curiosity, let me ask you something. If you were put in my shoes, hypothetically; you're struggling *REAL BAD* for money just to barely get by, and THEN you find out that the person you love most in the world, your ray of sunshine, has fucking cancer, and then you find even a slight ray of hope (even if it was pretty spotty looking), would you have gone for it?

For me, the answer would be yes. Anything if it meant I'd get to make Vanessa come back. *I'd sell my soul for that, for her...*

*Anything...*

**\*\*\***

The alarm buzzed through the holding corridor. I could hear the ventilation systems overhead kick in once again. My eyes became heavy again. It was time. Next time I'd wake up, it'd be to whatever horror they cooked up for 'The Danger Floor'.

I'd find this time, I was asleep a lot longer than the other times. A lot deeper. Apparently, I was out so cold this time that I somehow didn't notice until probably a good second or two in that I was suspended upside down like a bat, strapped tight in a straightjacket with a muzzle covering my mouth, over a large vat of sizzling, scalding water. And just like me waking up was a slow reaction, so too was the realization of the actual situation itself. No, *that* didn't kick in until ol' 'Bitch Widow' Web herself snapped me to reality by blaring the intercom, sounding as smug and thrilled as ever.

”***Wakey-wakey, sleepy heads! Welcome,*** ***Contestants D, E, and F, To the 'Danger Floor'!"*** Sounds of "Oohs" and "Ahhs" played out before she continued with ***"Caution; HOT, HOT, HOT! Trust me, you don't wanna take a dip in THIS hot tub..."***

Following this was a *ding* sound, like an air fryer or something. I began moving my head around limply. To my right was Contestant D, with Contestant F on my left. Both were hanging upside down and muzzled over vats of scalding water. Contestant F was just waking up like how I was, while Contestant D, seeing the shit we were in, was already struggling, wiggling frantically against the straightjacket. I heard Web laugh amusedly over the intercom.

***"The three of you will continue to be lowered towards the vats below you. As you feel the heat, you'll feel like you're in Hell. Question is, who's got a hot enough head to take the heat, or will you all fry?"***

I heard from my right, Contestant D letting out muffled cries of panic. Beneath the muzzle, she sounded young, maybe 20 or 22, max. She was squirming harder and harder, her entire body swinging back and forth like a piñata.

***"Oh, I wouldn't be wiggling very much like that if I were you."*** Web's voice teased enthusiastically over the intercom. ***"See, those ropes holding you guys are old. Strong, sure, but old. They're not meant for swingin' around in."*** She giggled after saying this. ***"Don't worry, you'll be just fine. That is, as long as you just relax and... chill out!"***

Sounds of crowd laughter played out before she said ***"Good luck!"*** After that, it was quiet. Save, that is, for the violent hissing of the searing vats below the three of us, as well as Contestant D's muffled pleas. She continued swinging around. I could see the rope beginning to wear away with each swing of her body. 'Bitch Widow' was right about one thing, these ropes *were* old. *"She's not gonna last long..."* I thought as I heard and felt the mechanisms the three of us were tied to begin lowering us down.

Before we'd even been lowered five or so inches, I was already beginning to feel stinging across the top of my scalp. Almost like it's own reflex, sweat began forming and flooding from my face in bullets, raining down to the vat below me. I think I actually saw most of them evaporate in midair about three or so inches above it. This, as well as the blood rushing to my head, caused me to start feeling nauseous.

The room, which was already hard to distinguish anything in because of how dark it was, plus the steam from the vats, now became blurry to me. The other two just looked like two white blobs dangling and wiggling beside me. Contestant F was now struggling as well, though not nearly as much as D was; who was now swinging so violently that I'm honestly still surprised the crane she was hanging from hadn't already snapped. Not that it made much difference in the end, anyway.

I wanted to cry out to her, to both of them, tell them to calm down. I guess, though, the same reason I'd be able to withstand this particular challenge was also the same reason I'd be unable to try and help the other two. Unlike them, I was succumbing to the environmental effects. I knew, one way or another, sooner or later, I was gonna pass out. Whether or not I'd be waking back up again, well, that was just as much anybody else's bet to win or lose as it was mine.

Either way, I'd be out soon. But not them. They somehow had enough energy to keep struggling, fighting, as if it would give them a way out. Contestant D gave one big jerk to the right towards me before her rope finally snapped and she plummeted like a stone straight down into the vat. Despite being muffled and short lived, her screams of pain, terror, and anguish will be something; one of the many "somethings", that will always haunt the back of my mind for every second I'm still alive, both awake or asleep. I just barely saw for a brief second, Contestant D's eyes as her milky white skin charred. That's also something I'll never forget.

*She was so young, so energetic... She was alive...*

It wasn't long after this that my own vision darkened. Shadows crept quickly from the corners of my eyes. I was only about four or so inches above the vat now. My head felt light. Everything was completely blurred. I lowered another inch. My face felt on fire now. I was so close to the vat. I could hear the liquid sizzling; wildly cracking and popping, before everything became muffled. I barely got one last glimpse at Contestant F, who had stopped struggling, and then...

Nothing...

**\*\*\***

I saw her face again. My sweet Vanessa. I saw her eyes, staring back at me, frightened and sad. She didn't say anything to me. She couldn't.

She couldn't speak, scream, cry, anything. She could only lay there, wired to a spiderweb of different wires and tubes, staring at me with the sickliest, ghostliest, most corpse-like face I'd ever seen. Her face was tired, anguished. I could see it. She was tired of fighting. Tired of trying. Tired of hoping...

She couldn't speak, but I could hear it.

*"Please Eric... Make it stop!"*

**\*\*\***

The alarm sounded and I was jolted upright again in my cot. Pent up adrenaline was causing me to hyperventilate, sweating profusely while throwing my head on every direction; alerting myself to who or whatever danger I felt was waiting for me. There was nothing.

I was in my cell again. My empty, dull, depressingly lifeless cell. I then heard the intercom sound off.

***"Well, well, well, Let's hear it for Contestants E and F! Congrats to you two for making it past 'The Danger floor'!"*** She followed this with sounds of crowd cheering. ***"And let's have a GIANT round of applause for Contestant V, the SOLE survivor of 'The Nexus round'!"***

The cheering played again, even louder this time. I finally laid back onto my cot. I slowly started to relax. There was no danger. Not for the time being.

*Only the 'Bitch Widow'...*

***"You know what THAT means?"*** Sounds of crowds gasping in excitement. ***"That's right, Contestant V will progress to the finals; the 'Judgement round'! As for our winners of the 'Danger Floor', You both will move on to the 'Nexus round' to see who will be facing Contestant V in the 'Judgement round'. And as for Contestants R, G, and L, get ready, because you'll be up in one hour for 'The Danger Floor'!"***

The intercom went silent after that. It was quiet again. Dead silent. The only sounds in the background were the air rushing through the ventilation and the static hum of the dim fluorescence coming from the hallway.

I laid still, my cot cradling me in a crude, ungentle embrace. I stared once again at the ceiling; at 'Hell'. This time, I could start to see the spots of chipped paint sort of shift, morphing to resemble Vanessa's face. The same dead, sickly face I saw before. Sunken eyes, formed from the two largest exposed patches of the ceiling underneath, stared longingly back down at me. I won't lie, this was when I couldn't help but shed tears.

For as much pain as I'd endured, both physically and mentally, up to that point, That sight alone was the most painful thing I could endure. It was the reminder of Hell, just like the paint-chipped ceiling above me was. It was the lingering dread of what waited for me if I failed; a life where she suffered until she was no more. It was my nightmare, as well as my single biggest motivation.

*It was my worst fear.*

**\*\*\***

*"What's your biggest fear?"* I remember being asked that at the beginning when I was signing up. It was the last question on the form, at the very bottom in almost fine-print. I didn't answer it, though. Funny enough, that was an optional question. I figured why answer that? Why make anything any easier for them, just to make things harder for me.

*Again... Ironic....*

*Funny...*

**\*\*\***

I closed my eyes. It was hurting to think about. They snapped open again when I heard the sounds of clicking footsteps coming toward my cell from the end of the hallway. I sat up to listen. I recognized them; platformed high-heels, slick and solid. My visitor was none other than 'Bitch Widow' herself.

"You look tired." she said, crooning to me. "You should relax, Tiger. You look like you've lost something..." She came up to the bars of my cell, locking her eyes, her deceptively warm, inviting eyes with mine. Her face was one of longing, of hunger almost. "You have lost something, haven't you? Or rather, *someone...*"

I didn't answer. Not verbally anyway. Instead, I simply turned away, laying down on my stiff cot and facing the opposite wall. In a way, I was like a child, trying to show grit against his parents by giving them the cold shoulder, even when, in reality, I was as tiny as ever. I heard the bars of the cell slide away. Following this, I could hear the clicks of her footsteps coming towards me.

I didn't move. In a way, I knew this was just yet another trial. Just another part of the game. *Another fear to overcome.*

I flinched, however, when I felt her smooth, slender fingers pass slowly over my chest. *"Shhh...* Just relax..." she whispered in my ear, "You don't need to be afraid, Tiger. Trust me, if I wanted to hurt you, I'd have done it."

I felt her tongue slide across my cheek, ending with a playful nibble on my ear. My body tensed as she did this. I felt excited and anxious at the same time. My heart started beating quicker and quicker. Her hand moved sensuously across my chest again and I heard her softly giggle and whisper, "So tell me, who is it?"

I stayed silent, stiff. "Come on... It's not good to hold it all in like that. Who is it? Who's got your blood boiling and freezing at the same time?" Her hand passed from my chest and down the side of my leg. "Who is it that's making you go through this; all this pain..."

Her hand passed down my thighs. "Is it a friend?" she whispers. "Is it family?' She let out a soft, almost ecstatic moan and whispered, "No... it's not either of those, is it, Tiger? I'll bet it's a lover."

My body seized up again, hard. I struggled not to lash out. I couldn't give her that satisfaction; that she was right. That she knew, and I didn't even have to say a word. No, I had to keep calm. I had to keep fighting.

She giggled softly in my ear again. "You know, Tiger, I know a lot more than you think I do." Her hand continued caressing my thigh. "I know the look of someone who's afraid to lose something. It's why I like you. You're different from these others. You're fighting for something, or rather, someone. You have a purpose. You're in this for more than a lousy 50 grand."

She leaned close to my ear and whispered, "No... You're fighting for survival. you're fighting for what you love. I like that." She wrapped her arm around me, spooning against me. "The only question is, who is it?"

The room was silent again for another minute. I felt her body nudge closer against mine. "It was my son for me."

Her voice was different now. Her seductive guise was gone. Now she sounded small, pitiful. *Vulnerable.*

"I wanted him to have a home. A proper home, you know? A place where he could safely lay his little head." She stopped for a moment. I heard her let out a heavy sigh, like she was holding back tears. "I wanted him to have a life."

Her arms tightened around me. She was no longer powerful in that moment. She was tiny, like I was; like the rest of the contestants. A frightened little girl clutching a stoic little boy. Or at least, so she wanted me to think.

I wouldn't cave, though. I knew what this was. She was gauging me. She wanted me to spill my guts, give her ammunition to use against me later in the game. No, I wouldn't talk. *I wouldn't tell her why I was afraid.*

"When his rat bastard of a father threw us onto the street, I did anything I could to scrape up enough money so he could eat. I hardly got to see him, always too busy with every man who was willing to kick a few bucks my way. I still see the way he looks at me, his little blue eyes. You know what he asked me once, Tiger?"

I stayed silent, clenching my jaws. I heard her choke back what sounded like a sob. Her fingernails dug slightly into my chest.

In an even smaller voice, she said, *"'Mommy, when will this all be over?'"* I felt a lump form in my throat. For an instant, I saw it again; Vanessa's own longing face, begging for it all to end.

"You know what that feels like? Is that what it's like for you? Does it kill you to see the person you love look so tired, so empty?" Her voice broke completely and her grip tightened as she then whispered, "Are you so scared that you'll lose them, that you'll break yourself in every way necessary just to hold onto them?"

*"Yes..."*

Her body now seized up, freezing in place almost. My own heart was now jackhammering in my chest, desperate to punch straight through. I'd done it. I'd broken. I exposed myself to her, my enemy; to the 'Bitch Widow'. Time felt like it was frozen for a solid five minutes. No sounds, no movement, nothing.

Suddenly, I felt Web's body relax again, even taking her nails out of my chest. She went back to softly stroking my chest silently for another minute or so before I felt her sit up and lean down close to my ear again. "It was nice to hear you talk to me for once, Tiger."

With that, she planted a wet peck on my cheek before getting up and walking out of my cell. I was alone again. My body was shaking. I was nervous now.

In all honesty, up to then, I'd not really *feared* what I'd face in the next rounds. I knew that, whatever it was, however dangerous or life threatening, it would be nothing compared to the fear of losing Vanessa, of failing her. But now that power was diminished. Now, my strategy, my 'secret weapon' I guess you could say, was exposed. The 'Bitch Widow' now knew my secret and would now, no doubt, find a way to use it against me in the upcoming levels of the game.

*I was vulnerable.*

I could feel my eyes start to burn with tears. I knew I was essentially done for now. I'd lose; the game, my life, but worst of all, I'd lose *her*. She'd slowly and painfully die of cancer, and she wouldn't even get a decent burial. And it would be all my fault. All because I cracked.

*Because I was afraid.*

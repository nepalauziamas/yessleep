It’s  been a while people, A long time, hasn't it? So the business has grown  significantly since the last time I posted here. You see I’m going to  tell you my story because I won’t be alive for long, I’m being hunted.  Recognise it? before you say it, no I do not learn from my mistakes.  Apparently.

It all began a few  weeks ago, but before that let me tell you what has happened since the  last post. So I no longer work alone. I have employees, they don’t know  what they’re delivering, they just assume it’s regular old stuff regular  people send. Like Christmas presents or letters to love ones. when in  reality it could be basically whatever. But you see the difference  between now and before is that I now keep track of all the packages, I  know exactly what’s in them and I keep a record of everything that’s  passing through. No records of who or where it’s sent from or received  at. As I’ve said before, I take the privacy of my clients very  seriously.

Philips was the first  guy I employed. He’s the front of the business, he’s the legal CEO and  the man everyone thinks is the boss. It’s pretty hard for me to run a  business when I’m supposed to be dead. So Philips runs the business, I  just “Collect” all the profits you know. It’s pretty easy actually, I  get the clients as well as regular people to just pay for a package to  be delivered as usual as well as a crypto transaction for the not so  clean business. Now, Phillips isn’t the brightest star in the universe  but he’s perfect for my needs. Now Phillips used to be a father and a  husband but his family died in a car accident that left Phillips with  traumatic brain injuries. This means two things.

First  things first. Phillips is easy to manipulate due to the damage he’s  suffered due to the accident. I can’t blame the man though, he’s just  doing what he’s suffered through more than I have and that’s saying  something. I mean I’ve literally killed myself, that's certainly  something to put on the list of “Fucked up things most people haven’t  done”. But Phillips had his reasons why he wasn’t alright in the head.

Lastly  as to why Phillips is the perfect one for the job. He doesn't ask  questions. He just does what he’s supposed to do as a CEO. He hires  people, introduces them to the job, pays out salaries and so on. Now my  employees don't really have a high end salary due to the reason that  they’re getting paid from the clean business and the clean business  isn’t exactly a money making machine but that’s fine it doesn’t matter  because it’s enough to pay the salaries and isn’t bad enough to be in  need of government support to keep it open.

Phillips'  first decision as a CEO was to establish free coffee at work. I found  this silly but I guess it helps the morale of the workers. Keeps them  happy I assume. I mean this decision wasn’t necessary because we had no  workers besides Phillips but I guess it worked out fine.

Philips'  second decision as CEO was hiring  David, or Dave. Dave is my favorite,  he’s a chill guy in his 20’s ex military. He was fairly fit and didn’t  ask questions about shit he didn’t need to know about. He is usually the  guy that I put on the more dangerous jobs, sort of say. Those jobs that  aren't entirely legal. He usually does packages of all sorts and has a  license for driving basically any vehicle that drives on land. So he got  the ability to do larger package deliveries to a variety of locations  across the country.

Dave is also  the guy I trust more than anyone else in this company, Including myself.  He’s predictable and thinks logically. That is very important for me  especially when you deal with things that’s not legal. Due to Dave’s  time in the military he’s also very loyal and wouldn’t sell us out for  nobody. Now, Dave doesn’t have a family either, No wife or kids and his  parents aren’t with us any longer. I’m not quite sure why I’ve heard  something about leukemia or something along those lines. He doesn’t talk  about it and I couldn’t find much about him when doing my research. All  I know is that he’s served overseas for basically his whole time in the  military. Been to Afghanistan, Mali, Irak, you name it.

Then  we had Luke, Luke was, well he was a friend. He was the accountant who  ran the illegal section of my company. He kept track of all the  transfers for packages and all of that jitter jatter. He was also the  only guy that I knew before starting with this whole thing. He was my  best friend before I “died”. He was a kid that lived with us before my  parents died. Yeah that happened too. probably due to old age and bad  genetics. I found him on the streets outside of that old gas station  that you probably know about now. He was left there alone after my  parents apparently went under when I “died”. I guess that’s to be  expected but still sad to see. Luke didn’t do anything wrong. I was the  problem there from what it seemed like but it still happened. Anyway,  Luke isn’t with us anymore… He died after a job which went badly, It  was, recently. Actually if I’m not gonna lie it’s the whole reason why I  continue to write these, and the reason why I’m scared for my life  again. You see our last job didn’t go as planned, we had  some…complications along the way.

***8 days prior:***

“Hey you jackass!” Luke shouted at me from the living room.

“What do you want now?” I replied slightly annoyed from the hasty wakeup.

“You do realize that we got a job to do right? you can’t just sleep through the whole days”

“Why? Philips takes care of everything we need, right?” I said with a sarcastic smirk.

I stood up and stretched my back before I continued to walk over to the living room.

Luke looked up at me from the laptop quickly before continuing working on the finances.

“Jackass…” He mumbled.

I  blinked a few times trying to get the sleep out of me. I continued to  the kitchen and got a large mug of coffee. Black as always, gives me  those good morning feelings.

“Hey man, come here a quick second, we got an order.”

I snapped out of my own thoughts and walked over to Luke.

“What’s up?” I asked leaning down to look at the laptop screen.

I  couldn’t believe it, it was the largest order that we’ve ever received  EVER. It was huge. definitely something we had to be careful of. I’ve  learned from my previous mistake about being an idiot. So I did as I’ve  done with any other package here. I simply asked the customer about what  is being transported, if extra security is needed, any specifics that I  had to know. It turns out to be a mafia delivery that needs a large set  of narcotics and weaponry to be transported to different locations in  scandinavia. I thought about it for a while and looked over to Luke who  looked equally intrigued as I did.

“That’s one hell of a request” He nodded his head slowly.

“Too good to be true” I said back.

“Ahh, come on Charlie, It’s a deal of a lifetime!” He shot out of his chair and walked around the room.

“You know this is a terrible mistake Luke, Don’t be stupid. I’ve already done this shit once”

“Not  everything goes bad and you know that! You’ve done larger orders before  and it hasn’t been a problem!” He said as quickly as my words had left  my mouth.

At this point Luke  seemed fairly annoyed at best and straight up mad at worst. He knew  about what shit had happened before. Not the whole time shittery that’s  unfolded before just some bits of the Jack situation. So he knows  perfectly well that I’m really hesitant with these types of orders. But  maybe he was right.

“Trust me man, this is going to be a blast, we can both go!” He said with a smile.

I  shook my head and thought about it for a while. Maybe Luke is right,  maybe I’m just paranoid. It’s a possibility, been through some shit that  would make anybody paranoid.

“Will you stop complaining if I say yes?” I asked with a half smile.

“I  knew you would budge, I’ll complete the order and make sure that the  drops will be loaded into a truck for you. Meet me down in Amsterdam  tomorrow and we’ll talk about it more alright?” He practically sprinted  to the laptop to confirm the order and location of everything.

I shook my head again and put on some clothes suitable for work. I grabbed the keys from the counter before leaving.

“See you in Amsterdam dumbass!” I shouted before closing the door.

I  walked out to my car. You see I’ve always dreamt of having one of those  old Chevrolet Nova SS cars, those classical American muscle cars. Yeah  one of those from 1969, a 6 cylinder beauty to put it simply. Well I  bought one of those, it’s surprisingly simple to buy illegal stuff on  the dark-web when you think about it. was a fracture of the actual  market price and it’s in great condition. I’m not going to think about  who had it before me, where that guy went, or where this car even comes  from. I don’t ask and you don’t tell, it’s simply easier that way.

Arriving  at the warehouse that’s stood there for years I thought back to the  warehouse Miranda had for those experiments. The flashbacks came  flooding in again like they have ever since I got out of that lab. I had  a hard time walking in concrete buildings, being in the woods and being  alone. That’s mainly the reason why I’ve moved in with Luke. Another  part is because I couldn’t stand seeing him just sitting there at the  old gas station trying to make a buck for some food. It’s horrible, I  couldn't just walk past it letting him starve. I had to do something. I  was obligated to do something, so here we are.

I  continued to walk to my office at the warehouse to manage a few things  before I left, to be able to source weapons and some kind of security.  Now there’s a lot of ways for a person like me to get my hands on  weaponry, everything between the dark web or just my own personal  sources. This time I was able to get my hands on a couple of handguns  for me and Luke. They were ready for pick-up in an area just outside of  central Amsterdam. Said and done I got myself a ticket to the  Netherlands.

I arrived a few hours  later at the airport in Amsterdam. I was instantly hit with the smell  of weed and water. I always wanted to visit the Netherlands but haven’t  had the ability to do so due to my past with my research in molecular  physics. But here I am in the country of the free. I thought it was at  least, due to their fairly free laws regarding less dangerous drugs such  as cannabis. It’s honestly a dream for someone in my particular  business. Might consider setting up in Amsterdam when you come to think  about it

\*Pling\* I snapped out of my own thoughts by the sound of my phone's notification signal.

“Hey man, I’ll be waiting over at that café we always talked about going to, See you there in what? 30-35 minutes or so?”

Of  course Luke was already here, I thought to myself. He’s always been the  guy to be effective with his time, not like me really. I’ve always had  the ability to just shut off sometimes and just waste my time for a  little bit.

As I was told I met up with Luke at that Café in the central area of the city.

“Everything is set up.” he told me as I sat down on a chair opposite to him.

“Good, You ready?” I asked with a slight smirk again.

“Was born for it!” He said excitedly.

We  started to walk away from the café to the area of where he had hidden  the truck with the packages that's' to be delivered. So it was a fairly  straight forward trip to be honest. We just chatted for a bit about  anything and everything. no problems at all at any of the border  controls on the way to Denmark. We entered Denmark with no worries too  and took some sketchy roads to make our drop-offs but on our way to  Norway Luke woke me up and asked if I knew who was following us. I had  no idea! At this point we were several miles outside of the nearest  society. So I was fairly creeped out by this and started to search  around in the truck for the weapons.

“Hey what are you searching for?”

“Fuck fuck fuck, Not like this!”

“What do you mean?” Luke said while speeding up.

The  car behind us got closer and closer and at this point they couldn’t be  seen in the rear view mirror anymore. they’re dead behind us. This  wouldn’t be a problem because We had packed guns which I picked up in  Amsterdam right after I got off the plane. But You see. The problem with  that is fairly simple. I forgot to pick up the guns. Now before you all  scold me for being retarded I’m just gonna say it myself. I am brain  damaged. So now that we’ve established that I had to figure something  out. But before I could do that.

\*BANG!\*

A loud explosion was heard from the back of the truck  as Luke struggles to keep the truck on the road

“The tire blew! Did you find the guns Charlie, we got to work quick with this one!”

“I’m trying Luke, I forgot to pick up the guns before we left”

“You did what?! You forgot the single most important piece of equipment for this trip? How stupid can you be?”

“Okay  stop scolding me and let’s get this asshole off our back alright? Hit  the breaks and quick he’s right behind us and we’re bigger”

Luke  thought about it for a moment before slamming the breaks. Everything  went flying in the cabin and another tire blew in the right side of the  truck. The car behind us slammed right into the back of the trailer  before spinning out of control into the forest. You would think this  would be all and well but the car smacked into the trailer of the truck  which set it off balance. Luke had troubles keeping control of the  vehicle until he lost control of the trailer. The trailer's back wheel  slid down into the dirt on the end of the road and the whole trailer  followed behind. It dragged us with it into the tree line and a semi  going a solid 70 mph slamming into trees without control usually doesn't  go very well. This time it went well for me, but not Luke. Luke got  caught by a tree branch and didn’t live to say goodbye. I climbed out of  the wreckage of what was supposed to be an easy job. And walked with  heavy but determined steps towards the car that laid a few hundred yards  from the semi. While approaching the vehicle I can see the driver  sitting outside the car heavily injured.

“Who are you!?” I shouted at him walking faster

“I asked you a question!” I continued

When I was just a few feet from him he cracked a smile and coughed.

“She wants you alive you know, she wants you back. To finish what you started.”

“Who wants me back huh? How do you know who I am”

“You see Charlie, you haven’t done what you’re supposed to do yet, she still needs you, and Earl misses you”

I  stood shocked, it couldn’t be. How did Miranda know where I was, I was  basically a ghost, how is it even possible. What did Earl mean with the  statement that he needed me? This didn’t make sense.

Fast  forwarding a little bit, we’re here now, at the warehouse again, from  where I’m typing this. I’ve packed my bags again, just like I’ve done  before. But this time just like the others will be a night with no  sleep.

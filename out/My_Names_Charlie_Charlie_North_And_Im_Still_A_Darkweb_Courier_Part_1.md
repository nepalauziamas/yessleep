 

You see, It's been a while since the last time we spoke. Well, for me anyway. You see these are my stories after everything with Miranda, Earl, Myself, Jacob and everyone. Some time has passed and well, so did Miranda. Yes, she's no longer with us but It's what happens you know. I've moved past it, or I've tried, what more can you ask?

You see I continued with the business but this time I did it right. I took in everything and everyone. No questions asked. Logged everything coming in and out in a private physical notebook. I rigged my warehouse well with explosives and firebombs in the vaults to make sure that nothing would be able to be recovered from it all. I feel like this is and was the safest way to do it all. Last time didn't end so well you know, but I did learn a few things. So for you who read the last little entry of mine know about a message to myself. Well it was time for me to send it, I know that because I just wrote it. Well thank god I did, or whatever other unnatural being or "god" who watches over us. You see a lot of different things have happened since last time we "spoke" . I've written it all down in my diary and I thought I'd share some things with you and try to recall as much as I can from it? Sound good?

Diary log from 2023-07-18:

"Order by: \[Redacted\] To be delivered to: \[Redacted\]

Client has dropped the following:

1 large crate containing, "Biological material"

1 package containing, "7,5kg of cocaine"

1 letter containing, "Letter to \[Redacted\]"

special care needs to be attended to the crate containing "Biological material"

Now I remember this one especially because of the Biological Material, I think you can guess what's inside that. I mean it's the dark-web. Now This specific crate contained organs of let's call it "opportunists". You see these people could have been killed, but it's equally as possible that these people sold themselves so that their families could live a better life. You see organs aren't cheap so if you would sell everything you have in you, Man that's a solid buck. Now you can sell all your vital organs for a good price, Corneas go for a solid 15-20,000 Euros. Kidneys go for a solid 60k a pair, Heart and lungs are the most expensive and they can sell for up to 250k a piece, liver for 50k for the whole thing depending on its quality. Some better some worse you know, it all depends on the person's lifestyle. If you're a full time alcoholic who drinks a bottle of Bailey's a day your liver is going for, well let's say a bargain. But if you're a person who doesn't drink at all, well, you're in luck! You can get a small fortune for that thing. Now the stomach and Pancreas sell for a solid piece too if you're desperate but nothing to hang in the tree you know?. Well anyway. This was packaged and handled in special conditions, you needed it to be stored in a specially constructed freezer and special security. Because you all know and if you don't. I take my clients security and their integrity very seriously. Now I know how this looks, I've already fucked that up before, or...ehhh, Have I though? Besides the point.

The delivery of this "Biological material" Was unusually ordinary. I delivered it to a hospital. Yes, I know it doesn't sound that weird but if we think about what I do for a living then you should know that this is more than unusual. My regular part of my delivery is to drop off these types of orders to old warehouses or basements in industrial buildings. Never in sanitary conditions or even worse hospitals. Well, I call it worse because it's unusual and quite frankly alarming. But It's a part of the job that I gotta deal with.

The second package was pretty self explanatory wasn't it, 7,5kg of Cocaine. Now this is pretty usual in my business but you see, I've never gotten a drop of to well, Jack's old place. Now it's alright and there's even a guy who picks up the packages at the old run down handicap toilet. It's like watching myself but from the past! It's honestly amazing to see. This guy even has that same old Bike I had you know, Man do I miss those days in some regards. That man behind the counter that I met at the gas station is still there. I guess he's always been there, watching and observing. Doing his duties in life. I guess so have I...But with my own thing. The right way, not like before...NEVER like before.

The delivery of these types of packages is nothing out of the ordinary like this one. It was just a regular old boring drop-off at a house in the middle of the city. Well, that would be suspicious but I tend to leave these in Amazon packages just to make it harder for people to detect it as well, a ton of drugs.

Now I own an enterprise of deliveries. You see I don't work alone anymore, I have employees. They don't think I work with what I do, they just think it's regular old deliveries. Most of the deliveries are pretty usual anyway and I let them take the packages and letters. Now the letters I don't know what's in those fuckers but I'm sure it can't be good. It's not sent by your regular old grandma's so I wouldn't suspect it's a congratulation card. They deliver all these, I'll tell you about my employees some other time not today. I don't have time for that. I got work to do. If You'd like to know a little bit more about my packages and the clients, please let me know. It's for your curiosity I'm typing this anyway.

So Sincerely yours, Charlie North.

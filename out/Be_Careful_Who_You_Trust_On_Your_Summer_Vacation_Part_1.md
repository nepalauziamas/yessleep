[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/whjum9/be_careful_who_you_trust_on_your_summer_vacation/)  


Summer vacation. Our one chance to stop and breathe in a year that felt eternal. When I quit my IT job over unpaid overtime, it seemed like my girlfriend Lena and I would have to give up our much-need summer trip.

Lena was Polish. Her family had been poor throughout her childhood, but they’d always found a way to take a trip *somewhere*: Bulgaria, Romania, The Republic of Georgia. She knew a place there, on the Black Sea coast, where she was sure that we could afford a holiday.

“Just be open-minded,” she said. “It won’t be like what you’re used to.”

Lena wasn’t kidding. I was used to ten-dollar margaritas from a tiki beach bar, greasy themed restaurants, and long strolls along sandy beaches.

In the small Georgian town we visited, wine and *chacha* flowed like water, the food was delicious (barbecued meat with herbs, cheese bread, garlic-walnut eggplants), but the beach…well, the beach was basically rocks.

I twisted my ankle the very first day.

If I put even a *tiny* amount of weight on my left foot, my ankle would explode with pain. It was difficult to hide my bitterness and frustration: who knew *when* Lena and I might have an opportunity like this again? At the same time, I didn’t want my bad mood to ruin Lena’s holiday.

When she wasn’t looking, I hobbled along the beach, asking locals if there were any activities that could be enjoyed by both an extremely fit girl and a slightly overweight programmer on crutches. The horseback and rafting trips I found were out of the question, but just when I was about to hurl my phrasebook into the Black Sea in anger, an old man approached me.

“I have a boat.” He stated simply. “I can take you. Show you the coast, the sunset…”

I hesitated. The fact that he’d approached me made me nervous. I’d heard my share of tales of con-artists who targeted tourists, but the only thing this man looked like he’d pose a threat to was a full bottle of liquor. He was about half my size and looked none too healthy, but the old man had an air of experience that was impossible to ignore. His weathered arms and wrinkles spoke of a life spent at sea; I trusted him.

“Let me get my girlfriend.”

Lena loved the idea. She loved it even more when she saw the man’s boat. It might’ve been a hundred years old or more, but every piece was well-cared for and polished to perfection. By the time I’d come back, the man had even prepared a small dinner for us to enjoy out on the sea: a tomato and cucumber salad, wine, bread, cheese, and cherry preserves.

It was like he’d known I was coming back.

The old man introduced himself as *Vakhtang* on our walk down the dock. As we boarded the boat and Vakhtang loosened his expert knots, I noticed something odd: everyone except Lena and I ignored the old man completely. They didn’t talk to him, didn’t even *look* at him–and as we’d seen over the past day, this place was every bit as gossipy and nosy as any other small town. Whether this *‘silent treatment’* was due to respect, fear, or something else, I couldn’t tell. We were soon underway, and I was left wondering what Vakhtang had done to cause the whole village to avoid him.

Vakhtang explained that he’d lived in the area for a long time, but had only recently started taking out tourists in his boat. Even so, the old man was a natural tour guide–pointing out interesting sea animals, geological formations, and even historical buildings along the shore. The way he described 18th-century Turkish raiders leaping over the walls of a seaside fortress or NKVD chief Lavrenti Beria strangling a ballerina who’d refused his advances on the balcony of a luxurious hotel one winter night, I felt like I was really there, watching it happen.Vakhtang seemed like a wise, kindly old man; as we drifted on the rollicking black waves, I itched to know why the little town treated him so strangely.

Iron-gray clouds accumulated around the setting sun. The sea got rougher, and Vakhtang’s boat began to feel very small. Lena seemed to be having the time of her life: she stood at the prow, looking like an ancient goddess with the evening sun on her face and the salt-sprayed wind in her auburn hair.

I didn’t want to spoil the evening, but I found myself wondering just how much farther we were going to go. The small ship rose and plunged over the waves, making my stomach drop nauseatingly. Lena hooted; Vakhtang smiled.

Soon, the colorful buildings along the coast looked toy-sized.

I realized with a growing sense of dread that I hadn’t seen any life preservers in Vakhtang’s antique sailboat–and that there was no way we could swim back to the shore from where we were.

I turned my face away so that Lena and Vakhtang wouldn’t see me hyperventilating, and tried to get myself under control. It was true that I’d never been so far out on a boat before, but I flew in planes over the sea all the time…so why was I reacting so badly?

The difference, I realized, was that now my watery grave was staring me in the face. From above, the sea looked like a map, something hypothetical. Down here, however, I could taste the salt on my lips, feel every lurch and pitch of the thin wood that floated between me and death. I leaned over the side and waited for vomit to spew out from my knotted guts.

Instead, I saw something that made me forget all about my nausea.

Shadowy shapes moved in the dark waves, getting larger and larger as they rose toward us.

I flung myself backwards into the boat and a burst of pain shot up from my ankle. Lena ran to me across the rocking wooden beams, asking if I was alright–

But Vakhtang just stood still at the center of the boat, arms outstretched like a crucifix, chanting.

The sea calmed. The twilight deepened.

*“What is this?!”* I whispered. I could feel Lena’s hands gripping my arm in fear–.

“It is time to make payment for your journey.”

So it *was* a scam. I should’ve known this would happen when we didn’t agree to a price beforehand. But while I was cursing our luck, Lena stood up for us:

“Thanks, but we’ll pay when we get back.”

“Back? There is no going back.” That enigmatic smile never left Vakhtang’s face

I could see the things in the water now. They had been human once. Now they were fishbelly white, bloated, dead–their flesh too cursed to be consumed by anything living in the sea.

Their eyes glimmered beneath the waves like distant stars.

Lena hadn’t seen the things in the water; her eyes were locked on Vakhtang. My girlfriend was a practical woman who understood how dangerous the world could be–and she never traveled *anywhere* without a knife. Cold metal flashed in Lena’s fist.

*“Take us to shore.”* Lena hissed. “Right. *NOW!*”

With a splash, a pale tattooed corpse burst from the water like a breaching whale. It swatted the knife from Lena’s hand, nearly knocking her into the sea–where the others waited. Lena’s mouth opened, then closed again, unable to believe our situation–unable to believe that the faces beneath the waves are real.

“The payment is a task. Something you will do for me. Not now–when I ask.” Vakhtang went on calmly. I realized with horror that this was all rehearsed. Who knew how many times, in how many languages, he had delivered this speech? The tiny buildings on the coast had never felt further away.

“What do you want us to do?” I asked quickly. Lena shot me a betrayed glance. *We needed to present a united front,* her eyes said, *why was I even* considering *negotiation at a time like this?*

“*Anything*. Whatever that I ask…and then your debt is paid. But you must agree now. Otherwise…” Vakhtang gestured to the dead in the water. Their wet, eyeless faces wore expressions of agonized terror.

*“FUCK YOU!”* While I vacillated, Lena rushed at Vakhtang.

He dodged, too fast for the eye to follow–

and my girlfriend went over the side.

*“LENA!”* I screamed, scrambling to the edge of the heaving boat.

Her modern sportswear glowed neon-bright among the naked, drifting corpses.

The ones that were dragging her down.

Like the dying sun, her iridescent clothing disappeared slowly into the abyss below.

I could see her limbs flailing…and I knew the same would happen to me if I jumped in after her.

My fingers dug into the wood of the boat, torn between Lena and survival. I tried to make myself dive into the black waves…but my will to live resisted.

“So.” I felt Vakhtang’s breath on my neck. *“You choose to serve.”*

Only the cries of seagulls and the lapping water broke the silence.

The ritual, the card, its bloody imprint pressed into the skin above my heart…it felt like a dream. That’s exactly what I told myself it was, and I could’ve believed it too–if it weren’t for the black tarot-card tattoo burned into my chest.

In the twenty years that have passed since then, I’ve found all sorts of explanations for what I saw that day.

Maybe Lena and I had been drunk.  Lena must’ve gotten tipsy and fallen in, that was it. Then our sailing guide had extorted me, and my mind had twisted the trauma into something supernatural as a defense mechanism.

My psychiatrist tells me that such things happen all the time.

I buried the tattoo beneath a suit and tie, just as I buried my memories of Lena by hiding in my work at a small-but-reputable law firm. The years rolled by like clouds blown through a bright summer sky. I married a hometown girl who had my parents’ blessing, fathered two children, and only thought of my promise to Vakhtang when I saw my bare chest reflected in the mirror.

This morning, however, the floor dropped out from underneath the rational little life I’d built. When I woke up, my tattoo felt warm to the touch. *An infection,* I told myself–*but then why did my fingertips smell of saltwater after I touched it?*

By lunchtime, the small black imprint was wet and burning hot. When my hand grazed it, I heard the old man’s voice inside my head:

*“It’s time to keep your promise…”*

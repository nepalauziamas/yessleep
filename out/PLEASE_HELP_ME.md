Run… I keep running. That's all I can do in this situation because something hideous has swallowed my friends, and it's trying to kill me. I'm hiding somewhere I think is pretty safe, and I'm calling for help with all my might. I will tell you what happened, and please save me as soon as you see this post.

I'm Rosie. About a day ago, my 2 best friends and I were excited about the trip we planned 5 months ago. We packed our bags and prepared to get in the car.

"Who's driving?" Chris asked.

"Me, me, I’ll drive," Chloe said and rushed towards the cockpit.

"Again? Don't fall asleep!" I yawned and said.

They all burst out laughing and set off in anticipation that it would be an interesting trip.

The location we chose was a forest in the west far from the city center, and it would take about 6 hours by road. We plan to camp near the stream, pitch a tent and make a campfire. Because of the busy study period, it's been a long time since last year's holiday, and now we have the opportunity to hang out together.

It was 5 p.m, we had already passed ⅔ of the way and had 30 minutes left until the rest stop and the next morning departed for the forest. On the left is the high mountain slope and on the right is the green edge of the forest. Kris and I were laughing and making sandwiches while Chloe was busy messing around with the flickering GPS.

“Do you want to eat, Chloe?” I asked while eating the huge piece I just took in my mouth.

“It's gross, just swallow it, and then you can talk” Kris scolded me and spread butter on top of the sandwich and gave it to Chloe.

Chloe chewed and nodded. "Looks like it's going to rain."

After Chloe finished her sentence, a flash of lightning struck right in front of the car. Chloe slammed on the brakes and Kris and I tumbled forward. After making sure that no one was injured, we opened the door to go outside to check and saw traces of the lightning that hit the road just a few centimeters from the car. At the same time it was starting to rain heavily, we went back to the car and discussed what happened earlier.

“I thought my life was over,” Chloe said, wiping her hair with a towel.

"Lucky we’re okay," Kris sighed.

I was about to comfort them when I suddenly heard a faint voice.

“Save me”

I was dumbfounded because I thought I had misheard when it rang again, but this time the voice was a little muffled as if someone was squeezing the throat.

“Sav… save me… please..”

I involuntarily turned to Kris and Chloe and saw that they were also looking in the direction of the voice.

“Eh.. Did you hear anything? I heard a voice..” I was talking when Kris interrupted me. "Screaming for help?"

We looked at each other in horror without saying a word, as if we were praying that it was just the aftershocks of the lightning strike that we had misheard. The air in the car grew increasingly silent, the silence suffocating me. I turned to Kris and saw that she was very nervous, shaking with sweat and staring in that direction. I called out.

"Hey Kris, are you okay?"

Kris slowly pointed towards the forest and said. “I just saw a shadow of someone lurking in that tree over there, staring at us.”

We looked in the direction of Kris's hand, trying to look closely to figure out who it was but it was raining heavily, dark clouds covered the whole space so the only thing I could see was a gray color. Suddenly, the bottom of the car shook violently like something was crashing into us. We screamed and tried to keep balance, I looked back and only saw a black shadow go past the rear of the car and run into the woods. My heart gave a nervous thud, but I tried to stay calm and didn't tell my friends to avoid causing more fear.

When things cooled down, we decided to continue to the stop not far away. After driving about 1km, I heard the wolves howling madly, I had an uneasy feeling in my heart. I clutched Kris's hand to reassure myself, but through its sweaty, cold palms, I could feel her fear. We were going to the bend, suddenly there were countless stones rolling down from the mountain slope, the small stone after the big one rolled down the front of the car, I panicked and looked to the left and…

\_\_\_\_\_\_

My head hurt, I opened my eyes dimly, but the surroundings were covered with darkness and the noise of insects. I realized the car was tipping over because I was upside down, then I reached for the flashlight and tried to crawl out the window. I flashed my flashlight, called Kris and Chloe but no one answered, bent down to look in the driver's seat and saw Chloe unconscious. I called her  but still no response and I was dumbfounded when I looked down at the back seat because Kris sitting next to me was nowhere to be seen.

I shouted out Kris's name but the only response was the rustling of leaves and the sound of insects. I didn't know what to do, I quickly pulled Chloe out and splashed water on her face to wake her up. After a while of trying, Chloe also woke up, dreamily asking what happened, I didn't wait for her to finish, and immediately told her that Kris was missing. Chloe got up and looked for her phone to call Kris but couldn't get the signal, I cried in vain because I've never felt so scared, surrounded by a big forest, it's dark and we're also tired after what happened.

“Everything will be fine but now you and I need to go find Kris” Chloe said and hugged me.

I sobbed, calmed down, and we grabbed the things we needed to hit the road. As I walked away, eating an unfinished sandwich made me worry about Kris even more. Suddenly Chloe stopped, signaled to be quiet and turned off the flashlight, I followed and tried to listen when I heard the echo back. The sound of rustling, friction under the weeds was like someone was dragging something on the grass. We gently advanced forward when a small path appeared separating the place where I stood and the forest on the other side.

After realizing that the noise was coming from the opposite direction, we crossed the trail and entered the forest. After following the sound for a few minutes, it suddenly stopped, me and Chloe also stopped and waited. Another series of noises appeared, it creaked as if it were climbing an old wooden staircase, accompanied by a rustling over the rough surface and it ended with a loud knocking on the door, echoing in the darkness of the night. I grabbed the hem of Chloe's shirt, took a breath, and Chloe led me forward. We turned on the flashlights after a while of groping in the dark, and in the night emerged an old, decaying wooden cabin and perhaps the creaking noise from earlier was coming from here.

“Someone was here” I whispered into Chloe's ear.

She nodded in agreement. But come to think of it, why was that person in this cabin because it didn't even have any lights on. While I was lost in my thoughts, I realized that Chloe was getting closer, I tiptoed and ran to Chloe's side. When I stopped and stepped on something hard, I bent down and felt it was a phone. After picking it up, we discovered it was Kris's phone, the screen was broken and there was a sticky slime on it. Chloe and I looked at each other with implicit certainty that Kris was around and maybe something bad was going on.

“Let's go check inside,” Chloe said.

We walked up the steps and gently pushed the door open, a strong fishy smell hit my nose with the creaking sound of the floor breaking the silence. In the center of the outer space, almost all the wood had rotted, on the floor were tables and chairs scattered, we had to drift to the sides to get inside, and then stopped in front of the faded wooden door and wondered what would be in there. I pulled the knife from my pocket, ready it in hand, and motioned for Chloe to open the door. Chloe pushed the door and we hid to the sides waiting for a response from inside the room. Only the sound of dripping water could be heard, I suppressed my gasp and looked over at Chloe, we looked at each other and nodded, deciding to go inside.

Chloe turned around to shine the flashlight directly into the room, I also quickly slipped in. At this point we were stunned by the scene in front of us.

“Chesus...” Chloe blurted out.

It was Kris, hanging on the wall, her mouth torn up to ears and bloodshot eye sockets that couldn't see clearly. The noose tightened around her neck and her hands were glued to the wall as if forming a cross, the most terrifying thing was that the lower body had disappeared, only to see the intestines dangling on the floor. I vomited as soon as I saw that scene, under the dim moonlight I witnessed the scene where my friend was no longer fully alive. I cried and Chloe cried but tried not to make a sound, with so many questions in our heads we couldn't talk and couldn't imagine what had happened to Kris.

In the moment I was mourning for my friend, there was an invisible force pulling Chloe back, a scream of pain woke me up and quickly ran after Chloe. I could dimly see a tall shadow almost touching the ceiling, long, sharp hands clutching Chloe's legs. I screamed in an attempt to stop him, shivering as I saw the blinding crimson blood flowing from Chloe's feet illuminated by the faint moonlight. Running out of the cabin, his figure became clearer; His face was long, white, black liquid oozing out of his deep eye sockets, his mouth was wide, and countless sharp teeth were stained with blood. Chloe seemed to have fainted from exhaustion, I grabbed the knife and stabbed him in the leg and then he used his hand to knock me into a nearby tree. He then lifted Chloe up, opened his wide mouth and swallowed Chloe.

Despair overwhelms me as I watch him devouring my friend. Suddenly, he turns to my direction, and I realize that the next prey will be me. I ran for my life and tried to wriggle through the trees, running with all my last strength and that was the only thing I could do. I rolled my eyes and saw a cave on the side of the cliff and crawled into it hoping he wouldn't find me, the phone suddenly lit up because it had picked up a weak signal and I called for help but they were 1 hour away from here. I hope someone quickly comes to rescue me and if I magically survive I'll keep you guys updated.

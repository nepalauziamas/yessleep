I never loved you. That's a fact. 

You were a lying, cheating, manipulating piece of shit. You controlled what I did, what I said, what I wore. You beat up my brother. You tracked me. You had photos of me that I didn't know about.

Do you know what was the last straw for me? When you beat me, Darren. When you physically hurt me just because I didn't get you exactly what you asked for.

It hurt, you know? Have you ever been beaten by a person twice your size simply for a small mistake? 

I tried to escape; So many times. You have no idea. Last year I tried to save up money to buy a ticket to run to another city, but you found my money and used it all to buy beer for your friends. Didn't even care when I cried to you. 

Then I tried to stay at my friend Lilian's place for a few weeks while I tried to get back on my feet. But you found me, because you had a tracking device strapped to my bag like a fucking creep you are.

And then I tried to call for help from other people. But you could see my texts. You could see me through the cameras every day even if you weren't there yourself. So I couldn't really do anything. 

But when you fell sick and had to stay home from work, Darren, that worked in *my* favor. You were so weak from your cold that you slept most of the day. That's a little dangerous, don't you think? A little risky?  
But you didn't, because you don't think. If you ever do, it's about yourself. 

So when I had to nurse you back to health, *I* was the one in charge. Everything was in *my* hands.

I could've simply put a few drops of bleach or that window cleaner in your tea. I could've drugged your medicine. I could've given you three pieces of that super strong antibiotics instead of one. I could've left and you would've died because you didn't have anyone to take care of you.

But I didn't. Why? I wanted you to suffer. I wanted you to go through all the pain I did. 

So what did I do, Darren? 

It was simple: One fine day, as I've given your medicine and your cup of tea as usual, I went outside for a little bit. 

Do you remember all those days I went out to "visit" Lilian, Darren? Of course you do. 

I wasn't visiting her. I was going to the animal shelter, getting more and more of them.

So when I went out for a little bit, I went back there. Gathered up so many of them. The thing is, they listen to me only. I've trained them to do so. It took months but I did it.

So I led them all to the house. They were all hungry - I haven't fed or given them water that day. 

I brought them all - 13 in total. I'm sure you could hear them through the door, could you, Darren?  
They were hungry. They were thirsty.

And they were dogs. 

They have teeth. They have strong bodies. They have a leader.

And that is me.

So when I opened the door and all of them leaped into the house, right to the couch you were sitting on - do you know what I was thinking, Darren?

Now everything was in *my* control. *I* was the one in charge with you. *I* had power. 

I guess we're even now, huh, Darren?

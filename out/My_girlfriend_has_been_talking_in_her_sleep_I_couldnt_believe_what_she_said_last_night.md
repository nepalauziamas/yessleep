**“I’ll kill you, you bastard.”**

I woke up with a jolt, my skin prickling. The room was pitch black, but I could vaguely make out the shape of my girlfriend, Martina, sleeping next to me. For a brief moment, I wondered if the words had been nothing but my imagination. The result of a sleep-deprived mind. I knew I shouldn’t have stayed up playing all those video games.

Or maybe it was the whiskey. I could still feel its aftereffects sitting in the pit of my stomach, thirst stinging my throat. Gingerly, I picked up the water glass I always kept on the bedside table and took a few greedy gulps. It was going to be okay. It was only a bad dream. 

But as I drifted off to sleep, Martina’s voice found my ears again.

***“Please help me, Luke.”***

My eyes flew open again, my heart pounding uncomfortably in my chest. This wasn’t the first time I was staying over at my girlfriend’s. Martina had talked in her sleep before, but it had always been random gibberish about laundry and hiking and… cats! 

I wondered if she was having a nightmare. Gently, I flipped over to her side of the bed and put my arms around her waist. *There, that should do it.*

“No more bad dreams,” I whispered, nuzzling the back of her head.

She didn’t respond immediately. In fact, I was beginning to think she wasn’t going to say anything else, as sleep dulled my own senses, before a slow, deliberate snarl escaped her lips.

**“Maybe if I take out your vocal chords you’ll be quiet.”**

I recoiled, pulling my arms away and sitting up in bed. Martina had never said anything so vile before, and her tone was unlike anything I’d ever heard in my life. 

“H-honey?” I whispered, droplets of sweat springing out on my forehead, “Are-are you awake?”

She could have been, but if she was, she didn’t let on. I nudged her, hoping to get some kind of reaction - something that’d reassure me she was okay, but there was none. My brain was still foggy from the whiskey and I wondered if that had anything to do with it. Perhaps I was having a vivid dream of my own and I’d snap out of it at any moment, my girlfriend hovering over me, laughing…

But no matter how hard I pinched myself, I couldn’t wake up. I sat there, staring into the darkness for a while, waiting for the next morbid statement. It was 3:23 AM. Still a while before I’d need to get up for work. 

I decided to face the wall instead. I lay staring at it, my ears picking up on the slightest twitch, creak of the bed or rustle of the sheets. I wasn’t sure why I was getting so worked up. My girlfriend was kind and gentle, she was only having a bad dream…

**“You wanna have sex?”**

I was torn away from my slumber by Martina whispering directly into my ear. I could instantly tell she was right behind me, breathing down my neck, sending chills down my spine. 

Something cold and sharp was digging into the flesh of my thigh. Pain was pulsating through my leg and sending waves of nausea throughout my body. 

And then she giggled. A croaky, pig-like snicker that made my blood run cold. I could smell her breath, even though I was facing away from her. It was rancid, pungent; the stench of death. 

Without hesitation I sprang out of bed there and then, flinging the bedroom door open and making a run for it across the corridor. In my haste, I only managed to grab my phone. I must have looked a sight, staggering down the stairwell in nothing but my underwear, but I didn’t care. 

Only once I got out the front door of the building did I notice I was bleeding. A trickle of blood was meandering down my leg and onto the ground. A deep gash sat on my upper thigh that I knew was supposed to hurt, but I couldn’t feel anything. 

I wiped the blood off my leg the best that I could given the circumstances and dialed 911, mentally berating myself for not taking my clothes. As the adrenaline gradually wore off, I began feeling the implications of the chilly November air. 

The police arrived within fifteen minutes. I explained the situation to them through my chattering teeth and watched from the backseat of their car as they made their way into my building. Everything happened quickly after that. In fact, even a month later I am still struggling to come to terms with it.

The officers returned within thirty minutes and I could sense they were nervous, despite their calm demeanor.

“What’s going on?” I demanded, pushing the car door open and rushing to meet them halfway, “Where’s Martina?”

They didn’t answer immediately. 

“Uh, I’m really sorry,” one of the men finally said, “Martina’s injuries were far too severe and she has unfortunately passed away.”

“What?!” I stared at him incredulously, “Did she…hurt herself?”

The man shook his head, “It would appear that she was stabbed repeatedly in the abdomen and…then left to bleed out under the bed. She’s been down there for hours.”

My blood ran cold. 

“But…but…she was just in bed w-with me, I… I don’t understand…”

“Son,” the older police officer put a hand on my shoulder, “We are working on evacuating the building tonight. We have reason to believe that whoever did this to your girlfriend… is still inside.”

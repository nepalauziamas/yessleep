so this happened almost a year ago, I’ve been with my now boyfriend for almost 3 years. we are both native, and grew up hearing stories about things that lurk in the woods, but we’ve lived here pretty much our whole lives & as long as you don’t mess with anything it usually won’t mess with you.     

On this particular night me & my boyfriend lived with his family, his fathers family are all Cherokee & Choctaw, ( FULLY not that “my great great grandma is a cherokeee princess bullshit ). & his fathers wives family is Navajo, she comes from the rez in New Mexico.       

Now, knowing what kinds of natives were dealing with in this story, (I’m just Choctaw & Blackfoot) . I can continue.      

It was about 11 pm & me and my man just left work, we were already heated at our own problems seperate from eachother , but those combined will cause a collision. which it did, we lived with my boyfriends family, his dad, step mama & baby sister. Now us being angry, and in close confines we start arguing , honestly pretty loudly. We live in a little place called Salina Oklahoma it’s Cherokee country. Beautiful rivers & trees & fields that spread for miles. His fathers home sets back in the trees away from the street, and has 2 neighboring houses on either side, at comfortable distances, not anything you’d see in suburbia. 

The only thing I’ve maybe failed to mention thus far is that his home also somewhat neighbors a graveyard & if you know about sgilis you know how crucial graveyards are to them.        

So back to me & my man arguing, our car windows are down, I guess we just didn’t notice at this point. But at some moment the whole energy kind of shifts everywhere around us outside. So much so it causes me to completely just close my mouth, he caught on to the feeling of the atmosphere & also shut up for two seconds. I tell him to “shhhh” & stick his ear out the window, somewhere it sounded really far away, was someone mimicking animal noises, they weren’t in any specific way one animal, this sounded like a human maybe testing to see if they can call deer ? & if you’ve ever been lucky, you know what a real deer sounds like.       

At this point we really didn’t even think anything of it, we didn’t see anything & the door was 15 feet away from our car ? what was the worst to happen ?  So we go back to arguing, (I tended to be a little toxic) & as we’re arguing I see something HUGE volt insanely fast across the back yard, (which on my father in law’s property is gated in). Maybe it was the dog ? We did have one & he was a larger dog. But no, there’s goes the dog literally chasing this thing across the backyard. I ask my boyfriend if he seen it & he hadn’t, so I was already shaken up. At this point I was just looking & listening as much as I could to everything around me.       

But as I look towards my boyfriend & out his window, behind a tree I see something duck it’s head back. Now I do smoke weed, but I’ve NEVER hallucinated ??? like that’s not normal. So just to make sure I’m not crazy & i stare at the tree & long behold something with antlers on their humanoid head looking right at us, it didn’t have eyes, it’s face was black like a shadow or like a silhouette. But it ducked again just as I was making out the rest of the shape. Now obviously I’m telling him “look, look what the fuck is that !?” I just had to know if he was seeing it to, & he turned to look just as the creature poked its head out again, he let out a scream and threw the car into reverse to point the lights at this tree, whatever it was had already began it’s descent back into the trees.       

After that night we didn’t go back outside in the area after dark & eventually moved out of his fathers house. We’ve had multiple experiences since this one maybe somehow connected? we don’t know what this was, or what it could’ve been, we’ve theorized on his step mom not liking us & maybe cursing us with a sgili ? Or any number of things. Whatever it was, it’s still definitely out there, so just watch out, especially on native lands.

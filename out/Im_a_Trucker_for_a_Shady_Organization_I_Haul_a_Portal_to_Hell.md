Every few weeks, I receive an assignment. I find every vehicle I sit in becomes the damned truck, until I complete the delivery. I wanted to chronicle my deliveries and hopefully get some of this off of my chest.

Assignment 23, Day 2, 3:11am

"Keep your hands on the steering wheel, no sudden movements!" The officer shouted, using his microphone to blare over the siren.

I did as I was told, placing my hands on the steering wheel. I watched the passers-by slow to watch the spectacle.

"Drop the window." The officer ordered, hand hovering over his holster. He added "slowly!"

I slowly lowered the window, leaving my right hand on the steering wheel. "Good morning officer, how may I help you?" I yawned, slightly annoyed that I'd been pulled over just shy of the rest stop.

"An anonymous tip called in. Come out and cross your hands behind your back. You are under arrest." The officer sprayed my face with saliva, practically frothing at the mouth.

Thanks to some poor decisions in the past, I knew better than to run my mouth. "I am going to open the door sir. Please step back."

"Don't order me around!" He growled, drawing his pistol. My pulse quickened slightly at the sight.

"Sorry officer. It's been a long trip and I'm incredibly exhausted. I was trying to make it to this rest stop and catch some sleep. Please instruct me how to act."

"Open that door." I opened the door, where the officer pulled it the rest of the way. He didn't seem to mind my lack of a seat belt. 

He proceeded to cuff me, lead me to his rear seat, throw me in, and slam the door.

I rearranged myself to a more comfortable position. Just as I righted myself, the officer returned.

"Keys. Where?" The officer shoved an outstretched hand in my face, bending his fingers into his palm a few times, in a 'give me' gesture.

"Around my ne-ack?" I coughed as the officer tore the necklace from around my throat. "Wait!" I called, realizing what was happening. The officer ignored my calls, approaching the rear of my truck.

I threw myself low to the ground, unsure of what would happen. The one rule I had was to never open the back. Experience told me staying low was the best option, should that rule be broken.

**SCHWIP!** a meaty tearing sound exploded, then dozens of cars pressed on their horns. What sounded almost like hail pelted the roof of the cop car, tinging against the metal. 

**CLANG!** metal crashed against metal as the door slammed shut. The horns continued their auditory assault.

Cautiously I wormed my way upright, shivering at the thought of what I'd see.

"Here goes noth-guahh!" I lost my stomach, immediately regretting opening my eyes.

**ring! ring! RING!** my alarm blared, dragging from the edge of shock. Numbly, I wiggled my phone from my pocket and dismissed the alarm.

As soon as that concluded, my phone rang again. Groaning, I answered the call.

"Cici, the clock is ticking." My dispatcher, I'll call Shithead, snickered. As his cackling concluded, the line went silent.

With great effort, I managed to find the keys to my cuffs. They laid in a pile of crimson coated clothing just behind the truck door.

"Yoink!" I giggled, swiping the holster for myself. Casually strolling to the driver’s seat, I stole a glance in the mirror.

"You aren't well" my reflection said, a truth I tried to avoid.

"Yeah well, what can I do?" I retorted, rolling my eyes.

The mirror said nothing for a few minutes, so I looked up once more.

*Missing. Of course she'd hide*

I started the engine, shifted to drive, and went on my way. I was not out of the water yet.

4:09am

I decided to make a call before calling it for the night. "Ey, Shi-I mean Simon," I started. "What do I do if the cargo is crying?"

Shithead took a minute long sigh before replying "you have a single rule, Cici. Follow it." And he hung up.

The sobbing continued, occasionally with a soft knocking from within.

"Uh… hey in there?" I tried, testing the waters.

The sobbing stopped suddenly, so I pressed my ear to the cold metal side panel.

"What are you?" A woman hissed, or at least, in a woman's voice.

"A truck… driver? What're you doing in my truck?" I countered, quickly doubting the legitimacy of the voice.

"Wait, I'm in a truck?" She suddenly sounded very excited. "Let me out! Please! I've been trapped in here for too damn long!" She began knocking incessantly from within.

*What do I do? I can't just leave her… but I can't open the door either…*

"I-I'm sorry. I can't open the door." I bit my lip, desperately considering an excuse.

"Please! I'm begging you!" She broke out into fresh, violent tears. The banging became frantic.

I fell a few steps back, battling over what to do. I couldn't make up my mind, the whole while the banging and crying went on.

Another part of me broke as I carefully, quietly returned to the cabin. My sleep was plagued with these terrible nightmares. I don't remember exactly what happened, but I know it was something about getting chased through an endless mall. On the plus side, the crying was gone when I woke up.

8:23am

The rings under my eyes were pristine as ever, much like my progress on my route. At the rate I was going, I would make it in half a day.

**WHAM!** my truck swerved and tires screeched. *Thank you seat belts!*

Dizzy, I shot from the cabin to investigate.

"Shit mate, you alright?" I ran over to the totaled 4x4 half crushed like a tin can against my truck.

Smoke began trickling up from the destroyed vehicle, but the driver remained silent.

I bolted to my cabin, recovering my crowbar and fire extinguisher, then back to the black 4x4.

"I'll get you out!" I shouted, wrenching the door open after my fourth or fifth attempt. Inside, the ghostly pale driver sat, joints twisted all wrong.

"Heyyy…" they croaked weakly.

Swallowing back down the bile, I pulled the driver free. The driver was… incredibly light… like lighter than paper…

*No blood? What the hell is going on?*

"You're going to be okay-NOPE!" I screamed, hurling the driver as hard as I could.

"That wasn't… very nice…" the driver whined, not seeming very concerned as their body fell apart bit by bit.

"What the fuck!" I screamed, turning to run.

"Chill." The driver growled. Something tackled me to the ground, pinning me there.

"Get off!" I pleaded, flailing at my back.

"Calm down already. Seriously, you're giving me a headache." The driver's head snaked beside my own, pupilless eyes gazing into my own.

After a minute of failed escapes, I let out a trembling breath. "What?" I spat.

"Hi. Think we can move? That truck is about to blow" they warned.

As if on cue, a fire ignited out of the destroyed vehicle. The grapple loosened, and we took off.

"Shit!" I cried, feeling the gravel give and I began to fall.

"Gotcha" the driver caught me, then pulled me forwards.

**FUUOO!** the truck detonated in a massive explosion. As the smoke cleared, I was ever so slightly relieved to see my own vehicle unscathed.

"Hey? Heeey?" The driver called, though I could barely hear over the ringing in my ears.

"What!" I shouted, expecting my heart to burst any minute now.

"You know you have hell in your truck?" The driver asked.

"Yeah! Kinda hard to ignore, thanks!" I spat incredulously.

"Ah, hmm…" they trailed off. "I'll be tagging along then."

"Yknow what. Fuck it, sure. You're driving first."

The driver shrugged, snapping their limbs back into place with a sickening crunch. "Kay."

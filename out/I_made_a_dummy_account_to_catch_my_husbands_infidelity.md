My (28F) husband (30M) thought he was doing great in hiding his cheating, but I know him to well not to notice. 

I’m not here for sympathy, I’m here to ask for help. 

He started becoming overprotective of his phone, and going out every night at 1am. I always pretend to be asleep and wait till he comes back, and every time he does, he’s wearing something different, he smells of perfume, and he always takes a bath before coming back to bed.

Sometimes, I would find a strand of hair on his coat, or a lipstick in his car, or worse, a wallet. I made no advances, because we were happy. We had the perfect husband-wife relationship, our parents love us both, no family drama, nothing. 

I didn’t want to ruin it just because my husband was probably getting sick of me. 

But, he found out. 

I had my eyes open when he suddenly came back earlier than usual; 3AM. He was usually back by 5 or 6AM, so at the time, I was just doing my best to stay awake. It felt like I was the one doing something wrong, like I was the one caught cheating, but he asked for forgiveness. Begged for it, even. He said it would never happen again. He said it was just a fling. 

So I said okay. We had a serious talk about it, and we both promised to put this behind us. 

But…

I couldn’t.

A few weeks after, I made a dummy account out of my old one; one he hasn’t followed or heard about. I wanted to make it so the account wasn’t too new, and posted some pictures I got online. 

To my demise, he bit the trap. He was flirting endlessly to the woman I created and even asked for some pictures. 

I asked if we could meet. 

I shouldn’t have.

Now, I’m hiding in my car, watching as my husband prepares what only seems like a stash of a psychopath. He had everything. Chainsaws. Knives. Daggers. Katanas. 

I had no plans of going out. I was not about to be fucking killed by my husband. 

But then, by some miracle, some woman walks by and flirts with my husband. She looks exactly like the woman in the pictures, or maybe it was because it was night. 

They hit it off, and the woman rides in his car. 

As soon as they go, I speed my way to our house. I didn’t care about the red lights I passed through, all I wanted was to lie down and sleep and forget. 

But as soon as I got home, my body went cold. 

There. he. was. 

He was holding the woman’s… head. 

My eyes scanned for a body, only to see it in the kitchen. 

“Took you long enough to catch me, honey.” 

He calmly walked to the kitchen, humming a tune that I swear came from The Conjuring. 

I ran, and I’m hiding in our bedroom. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what to feel. I think I’m still in shock. 

Help.

Please. 

He’s knocking. 

“Darling, wife, come on out now. I promise I didn’t make a mess.”

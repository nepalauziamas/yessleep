My (28F) husband (30M) thought he was doing great in hiding his cheating, but I know him to well not to notice. 

I’m not here for sympathy, I’m here to ask for help. 

He started becoming overprotective of his phone, and going out every night at 1am. I always pretend to be asleep and wait till he comes back, and every time he does, he’s wearing something different, he smells of perfume, and he always takes a bath before coming back to bed.

Sometimes, I would find a strand of hair on his coat, or a lipstick in his car, or worse, a wallet. I made no advances, because we were happy. We had the perfect husband-wife relationship, our parents love us both, no family drama, nothing. 

I didn’t want to ruin it just because my husband was probably getting sick of me. 

But, he found out. 

I had my eyes open when he suddenly came back earlier than usual; 3AM. He was usually back by 5 or 6AM, so at the time, I was just doing my best to stay awake. It felt like I was the one doing something wrong, like I was the one caught cheating, but he asked for forgiveness. Begged for it, even. He said it would never happen again. He said it was just a fling. 

So I said okay. We had a serious talk about it, and we both promised to put this behind us. 

But…

I couldn’t.

A few weeks after, I made a dummy account out of my old one; one he hasn’t followed or heard about. I wanted to make it so the account wasn’t too new, and posted some pictures I got online. 

To my demise, he bit the trap. He was flirting endlessly to the woman I created and even asked for some pictures. 

I asked if we could meet. 

I shouldn’t have.

Now, I’m hiding in my car, watching as my husband prepares what only seems like a stash of a psychopath. He had everything. Chainsaws. Knives. Daggers. Katanas. 

I had no plans of going out. I was not about to be fucking killed by my husband. 

But then, by some miracle, some woman walks by and flirts with my husband. She looks exactly like the woman in the pictures, or maybe it was because it was night. 

They hit it off, and the woman rides in his car. 

As soon as they go, I speed my way to our house. I didn’t care about the red lights I passed through, all I wanted was to lie down and sleep and forget. 

But as soon as I got home, my body went cold. 

There. he. was. 

He was holding the woman’s… head. 

My eyes scanned for a body, only to see it in the kitchen. 

“Took you long enough to catch me, honey.” 

He calmly walked to the kitchen, humming a tune that I swear came from The Conjuring. 

I ran, and I’m hiding in our bedroom. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what to feel. I think I’m still in shock. 

Help.

Please. 

He’s knocking. 

“Darling, wife, come on out now. I promise I didn’t make a mess.”

Edit: Hi, just an update! I’ve scrolled past your comments and realized you guys were right! 

He didn’t cheat, and the opposite at that, so I went out of the room that night. He begged for forgiveness, which was something I really didn’t expect. One thing though, I did explain to hin that he may or may not have killed the wrong person and told him that I was the one behind the stupid account.

He said it was fine (surprisingly, this conversation went on casually as if we were talking about what food to eat for dinner) and that he’d just drive far away to throw the woman’s remains. 

Yes. Remains. While I was having the worst breakdown of my life in our bedroom, he had already put the woman in SEPARATE BAGS (this was a lot to take in especially because there was not one speck of blood on the floor or the wall. 

And, uhm, well, during the 5 days that I didn’t put an update, we were out… hunting. I won’t go into further details, but I kind of get why he does it. How it feels. How my blood rushes whenever they try to run – crawl away. 

Thank you for all your support, because now, I have one very loving husband, and…  the last time I counted there were 4 bodies here. I’m not sure, but, yeah! 

Also, to that one person that told the authorities,

Keep your doors locked.

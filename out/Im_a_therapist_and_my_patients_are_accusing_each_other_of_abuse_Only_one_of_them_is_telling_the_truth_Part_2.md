The following week, I set up my office for Lucas and Kierra's return.

But only one of them showed up.

"Lucas," I greeted him. "It's nice to see you. Will Kierra be joining us?"

He looked down and mumbled, "Not today."

"I'm sorry to hear that," I said, trying to mask my anxiety. The police hadn't found anything of concern last week, so I just needed to have faith that she was safe. "Did something come up?"

He took a seat in the couch and sighed. "We had a big fight last night."

"I see," I said. "About therapy?"

"Yeah." He nodded. "I wanted to come back, so we could work on our relationship. But she said you've already taken my side, so she didn't want to come back."

"I'm not looking to take sides," I said. "This isn't about winning or losing. A relationship should be a partnership, not a battle."

"That's what I keep telling her!" he said. "Sometimes it seems like she understands -- like she wants to work on things with me -- but then an hour or a day later, she does a 180 and thinks I'm trying to hurt her. I never even know what I did to make her switch."

I let out an uneasy breath. I still didn't know who to trust, but Lucas was the one who came in today, so he was the one I would try to help.

"You can spend a lifetime trying to manage her emotions -- tweaking your own behavior to avoid her outbursts -- but it won't make any difference if she still has a wound inside of her."

"What do you mean?"

"It's the difference between symptom management and root cause identification," I said. "Imagine a bucket with a hole in the bottom. What you're doing is repeatedly trying to fill the bucket, and then feeling inadequate when all the water leaks out."

"So how do I patch the hole?"

"You can't," I said firmly. "It's an internal problem that only she can solve, with the help of a professional. Right now, she's doing symptom management too. Her illness is convincing her that if she can arrange her surroundings just right -- find a knight in shining armor, a perfect romantic partner -- she will finally feel okay. But that is just using *external* distractions to fill her *internal* void. Her emptiness."

"She talks about emptiness all the time!" he said.

"I'm not surprised," I said. "Emptiness and boredom live under the surface of almost every Cluster-B disorder. I believe that's where the true wound lives, numbed out by all of these distractions. I would need far more time with Kierra to make any diagnosis, but if your suspicions are correct, you will have a long and rocky journey ahead."

He looked down. "You must think I'm an idiot for staying."

"I don't think that at all," I said. "But instead of focusing on Kierra today, I want to focus on you."

When it comes to abusive relationships, I try not to convince the victim that their partner is bad. Often times, that causes them to stop seeking help -- especially early on, when they're dealing with cognitive dissonance about their abuser. Instead, I try to help the victim see their own value. Once we rebuild the self-respect and self-worth, everything else tends to fall into place.

I didn't have enough information to keep talking about Kierra, but exploring Lucas's self-esteem couldn't hurt -- regardless of who was telling the truth.

"Lucas, do you feel hyper-aware of other people's emotions?" I asked. "Perhaps you can sense when someone's getting unhappy -- or a conflict is brewing -- so you step in to defuse it?"

"Yeah, exactly!" He lit up. "How did you know that?"

"The most common partner of someone with Borderline Personality Disorder isn't the Narcissist," I said. "It's Codependency. Caretaking. People pleasing. Rescuing. People who feel responsible for the emotions of others, burdened by constant guilt and worry when conflicts arise."

"Can I change that?"

"Of course," I said. "But before you can change it, you have to explore where it came from. Usually these habits start in childhood."

"Well, I had a really good childhood," he said, leaning back. "Both of my parents loved me. There definitely wasn't any abuse."

"It doesn't have to be abuse," I said. "Just someone who took up a lot of space. Emotional outbursts, constant fights, rigid rules, drinking issues, unpredictable moods… Anything like that?"

I know it's important not to ask leading questions, but codependents are likely to tell you they had perfect childhoods. With this approach, at least something might resonate with him that he wouldn't have otherwise considered.

"Holy crap, that's my dad!" he said. "He always had to be right about everything. Things would escalate from 0 to 100 for no reason. I think sometimes he actually enjoyed arguing."

"And how did that make you feel?"

"Well, it really upset my mom," he said. "She would get sad and cry. Sometimes they'd even shout at each other."

"But how did that make *you* feel, Lucas?"

"Bad," he said quietly. "I just wanted them to stop. So I'd make jokes, and I'd usually comfort my mom afterwards to make her feel better. She was a lot more sensitive than him."

"You learned to sacrifice your own needs to take care of others," I said. "To prevent conflicts and keep negativity at bay. And now that's how you approach relationships. But it's never enough, is it?"

"Never."

"That's because their issues have *nothing* to do with you," I said. "You can't change or save them."

"So what can I do?"

I reached into my desk and took out one of my favorite diagrams.

"This is the Karpman Drama Triangle," I said, handing it to him. "It has 3 corners: Victim, Perpetrator, and Rescuer."

"I'm the rescuer?" he asked.

"You're all of them," I said. "When we carry these wounds, we continue entering relationships and repeating the same story. Maybe we start as the rescuer, but our victimized partner inevitably comes to see *us* as the perpetrator. So we become the bad guy in their eyes. Then we're so exhausted and drained that we start to feel like the victim ourselves."

He shook his head in disbelief. "You're describing all of my relationships."

"Right, and it will keep happening until you see the triangle for what it is," I said. "A false version of love. Love is not heavy and sad. It is not pitiful and tragic. Love is light -- infinite and open. It flows freely from within."

"But my heart feels so heavy," he said, "Like a big ball of dread and self-doubt. How can I ever change that?"

For the rest of the session, I provided him with books and printouts about codependency. I'm a big fan of the firehose approach when it comes to introspection. Eventually, something's bound to click.

When our time was up, I stood up to walk him out of the office.

"If you can, please bring Kierra with you next week," I said. "I'm confident that we can help her too."

He nodded. "I'll try."

I opened the front doors for him and began unpacking some of the boxes in my lobby. I still hadn't found an assistant, but at least I would be ready when the right resume appeared.

Before I could make much progress, someone knocked on the front door. It was the FedEx guy again, and he was carrying two more packages.

I let him in and signed for the delivery.

"Did you turn your patient gay?" he said with a laugh.

"What are you talking about?" I asked.

"Uh, sorry." He went red. "It's just, last week he was with a girl. Today he left with a guy. And they kissed. So I guess I was making a joke?"

I frowned. "He kissed another man?"

"Yeah, right after he got into the car," he said. "One of those old PT Cruisers. Man, those are goofy looking cars--"

I ushered him out the front door and ran to my car in the parking lot. I saw a PT Cruiser on the main road, heading south.

After running a stop sign and cutting off a few cars, I was a comfortable distance behind them. I followed the car off the highway and into the suburbs.

My mind was going a million miles a minute. If Lucas was lying about the infidelity, what else was he lying about?

I had latched so strongly onto this idea of Borderline and Codependent, I practically fed him everything I expected to hear.

But now I was re-thinking everything.

What if Kierra didn't have Borderline Personality Disorder at all? Partners of narcissists and sociopaths often develop Complex PTSD, which can look a *lot* like BPD. That's what happens when one person manufactures jealousy and insecurity in a partner. Sociopaths love to play innocent while their victims self-destruct and question their own sanity.

And even if Kierra had BPD, she certainly didn't deserve to be deceived and betrayed. She deserved a chance at happiness, just like anyone else.

The car finally slowed down and pulled into a driveway, so I stopped a safe distance before.

I saw Lucas lean in to hug the driver. Then he stepped out of the car, walked up the driveway, and headed into the garage as the car drove away.

Consumed by curiosity and distrust, I stepped out of my car and closed the door quietly. Then I snuck through the woods and approached the garage from the side.

I peered into the window and saw Lucas wandering toward the back of the garage -- with a kitchen knife.

And that’s when I saw Kierra.

She was bound to a chair with rope, and her mouth was covered by duct tape.

She squirmed as he approached. My heart raced as I desperately tried to think of a plan.

Then Kierra looked up and saw me through the window.

Nothing came out of her mouth, but her eyes were screaming for help.

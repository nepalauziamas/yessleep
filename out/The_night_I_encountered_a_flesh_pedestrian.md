This will be my first time posting and this is a story I told nobody about. I am currently 17 when writing this story and just turned into the fresh age of 16. It was a Tuesday late night around two in the morning..I’m scrolling on TikTok just biding my time before I drifted off to sleep and I’m just watching the minutes tick by. Around 2:04 AM I hear screaming in my backyard which startled me. You see, there is a fence in my backyard and behind that fence are railroad tracks. Keep in mind that these tracks haven’t been used in years so a lot of vegetation and filth has wrapped around these tracks. The woods rot inward as insects and living organisms trot along the cracks of the wood with the accompaniment of a rustic steel smell behind them. Nobody goes there late at night. I hear this ear piercing scream emit from behind the fence which sounds like a wailing child but something inhuman accompanied those screams. The screaming lasted for a couple of seconds. About 30 seconds on an estimate. I’m startled in my bed and decide to take a look out of the window and I was met with a pitch black veil of darkness that was somewhat illuminated by the waning moonlight that just only allowed my sight to see just a bit of farthest point of backyard. I see nothing out of the ordinary and in my semi-conscious state I decide to waltz back to bed. About 7 minutes ride by and I’m convincing myself that I was just tired and was just hearing things. Then it happened again..the screaming..but it was closer this time. The screaming sounded like whatever  thing was, hopped the fence and sat in the darkness farthest from my sight to which I could not see and make-out what it was that was emitting this horrible scream. I begin to panic and immediately assume the worse. As it scream it would pause and scream out a name..(I’ll go by Jacky for this story)”JACKY” it screamed. I was terrified and was trembling as I stood there without knowing what hid in that darkness. The screaming lasted about 2 minutes long. It stops and I immediately hide under my bed sheets thinking I could pretend that it never happened. I thought to myself “I’ll just go to sleep and ask the neighbors if it was their kid screaming in the morning.”. During the following morning I awoke. I didn’t have much recollection of the events that happened during the night. I did my early morning routine and went to go ask the neighbors the million dollar question. I take a walk to the neighbors house and knock on the newly painted red door that smelled of fresh cedar. A man about his mid 40s opens the door. I asked “Hey man were your kids outside or something around two in the morning?”. He responds “No man. My kids were asleep and me and my wife were watching TV.”. I was somewhat unhinged and felt genuinely nervous. I ask him another question “Did you hear anything around the hours of 2 AM?”. He responds “Nah man. I didn’t hear a single thing.”. That answer sent chills down my spine as I try to regain my bearings. I look at the railroad tracks and saw something move in the brushes. Let’s just say I sleep with the windows locked and headphones on.

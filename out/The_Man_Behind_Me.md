"This tale is for those who believe in things unseen. Things that are wretched and morbid and truly obscene. I've been plagued by a man who's dark and tall, but when I ask if you see him - you won't notice him at all.

I've found that he's clever and keen and he often wears a hat. He moves like a breeze between this or that. But never dismiss him, he's always lurking and sometimes he'll strike all while smirking.

I thought I could escape him and my mind told no lies. But he had other plans for me, ones in disguise. I challenged his motives and he always laughed - that made me bitter, defeated and sad. See, I wanted to hurt him like he had always hurt me, but I was wrong in thinking I had that ability.

He heard my thoughts and attempted to stop them - that's when my life changed and people died often. The man will reveal his eyes once I provoke him and whoever is near will be beaten and broken. 

I tell you I've seen it too many times to lie - it's happened even to family and innocent passersby. I would ask for help, were that possible, but I'm afraid there is none, not even a hospital-"

"Stop right there man." I said to Mike gently.

"Is something wrong?" He asked with an inquisitive look.

"Well, not really wrong per se, but I think it needs work."

"What part exactly?"

"Just like, some of the words, you know? They rhyme and all, but they don't always… flow, I guess. Maybe you should read it outloud a few more times and pretend you're the average person."

"The average person? What does that mean…"

"Whoa, whoa, whoa! Don't worry man, I'm not trying to put you down. I'm just saying that perhaps you should think about how someone else is going to read it. Like, just because you can understand the cadence doesn't mean the next person will. You want it to be somewhat easy for everyone to read, unless you don't, in which case you've done well!"

"I think I understand… you're saying it's not bad, just difficult to read! Thanks Kenny!" He said before putting his head back into his writing.

"Oh… well, you're welcome!" I said quietly so I wouldn't bother him. I grabbed my stack of papers off the table and started to walk away. Study hall was basically over and Mike wanted my opinion on his project for English class. I'm taking creative writing and usually receive high marks, so that's why he came to me.

While his poem had its flaws, I could see it becoming something great - something terrifying. In all fairness, I was actually interested in hearing where it was going, but I had to get home because night was fast approaching. Maybe by tomorrow he will have a new iteration that blows me out of the water. I can only hope so.

Anyway, I'm Kenny. I'm just an average guy with an affinity for words. I love them and I love writing. I've received my own fair share of criticism over my own work and have learned to handle it well; it only makes sense to pass the experience onto someone like Mike.

It was, unfortunately, way later than I previously thought. There were around six cars left in the parking lot and none of them were mine, I was walking home. I didn't live particularly far away, but it was far enough that I regretted not driving or being picked up. The education center had an array of lights that brightened up the surrounding area, so for a while at least, I could see where I was going.

But, that only lasted for so long. Eventually the light from the center faded and I was left navigating by the moon. There were, of course, the occasional streetlamp, but not enough for me to feel safe. I hated walking at night, even around my own home.

And then, I had a really intrusive thought. I wondered about the man in Mike's writing. I wondered if he was behind me right then and there. When I turned around; it was just me and the wind. I had a bad habit of working myself up over nothing, but even though he only read a small portion of it - his story really affected me.

It may have even scared me a little.

No, I couldn't let myself worry. After all, it was just a story.

When you're walking, you sometimes forget how long it's been. It takes me a good twenty minutes or so to get home from the center at a rather generous pace. So far, it had been about five or six and I was already feeling too antsy for my own good. Every sound that wasn't created by me was enough to send a jolt through my body. I don't know why I'm such a scaredy cat… I'm just glad Mike couldn't see it.

Then again, maybe he would also feel the way I do. Like he was being watched!

I spun around - nothing. I scolded myself, "Kenny, what did we talk about? Nothing is going to get you. Relax."

But the feeling, that horrible, burning feeling of being watched remained and it felt even more prominent from my back. From behind me.

I spun around again and still, nothing. I'm sure if someone drove by and saw me twirling around on the sidewalk they'd have a good laugh.

Man, the night seems to always play tricks on me. Whether it's the moon or a shadow that looks like something else. I figured this was no different and after a bit of surveying, I continued on.

The next few minutes of my walk took me through an area without streetlamps. I couldn't stop thinking about Mike's story; it filled my mind with incessant thoughts. I knew I was just riling myself up with false notions that his writing was coming from a place of truth, but I just kept doing it. I thought, "What if that man is behind me right now?"

"... Maybe I am."

"What? Who's there?!" I spun in place and searched for the source of the voice. It sounded like it was in my own head, but that was impossible.

Or was it?

I stayed in the same spot for longer than I should have. The area was next to a small park that bordered a river. No one else was around as far as I could tell, but with what little light I had; it would be highly improbable that if someone were nearby, I would see them.

Still, I searched the best I could. Without moving, of course. I even looked for a man with a hat, just in case. But, my only company was the wind as a quick breeze brushed against my face and reminded me of my mission to get home. Too much delay brings about wicked things - that's what I always say.

I began walking again, hopeful that I'd make it home uninterrupted. The severe lack of sound other than my own footsteps drove me wild - my nerves were on edge. I checked the time on my phone; it had been around ten minutes since I left the education center. For some reason, as I walked, things were beginning to look rather… unfamiliar. I thought, "You're just being paranoid, Kenny. You've been here a million times - there's no reason to panic."

A voice floated through the air, faint and weak, "He moves like a breeze between this or that…"

And then, I thought I knew what was going on. "Mike? Is that you? If you're upset about my criticism, I can understand! Just please, don't try to scare me…"

I got the feeling I was being watched again, but it was much stronger and felt like it was coming from right over my shoulder. I stopped and turned quickly and the feeling shifted as I spun; it was always behind me.

I started counting seconds on impulse - one, two, three… I timed them with my breaths in order to calm down; it worked, for a time. You are probably asking yourself, "Why aren't you just running home?!" And to answer your question, I was simply petrified. Too much stimulation was causing me to stand in place and overthink.

It was like forcing myself through a yard of thick muck just to move enough to break free from my statue-like state. But once I did, I continued my brisk walk home ultimately feeling free albeit a little shaken up.

Streetlamps started appearing again ahead of me and with them, the light. Instead of feeling scared, I felt warm and safe like being wrapped in a comforting embrace.

And then, I saw someone standing under the nearest lamp. I froze in place; it's not often I come across another person while walking home. This area of town is scarcely traveled, especially at night. I watched them and they did not move. Suddenly, they slumped down into a disheveled pile of clothing and flesh; it made me jump at first, but I quickly settled myself.

Instinctively, I rushed over to them. I patted their shoulder and asked, "Hey, are you alright?!" I pressed my palm flat against their back but I couldn't feel them breathing. I started shaking them and searching for a sign of life, however none remained.

That's when I saw the blood. The pooling was slow and that's why I didn't notice it right away. Now I could see… 

They were dead.

"People die often…"

I shot my head in every direction, "Come out now! This person is dead, stop fucking with me!" Nothing of consequence came from my outburst, just another cool breeze. I started dialing 911; it was the least I could do, I just hoped I wouldn't be pinned as the culprit. To be honest though, I was in shock - so I don't think my explanation to the police would be read as too abnormal.

They said they would have an officer there shortly and that I had to wait for them to arrive. I begrudgingly turned the person over and electricity danced across all my nerves at once because their face was mangled beyond recognition. If I could describe it accurately, I'd say it was like someone reached forward and just grabbed their face, I mean like, snatched it right off. Now the only thing left was a baseball sized crater that was bleeding profusely.

I just about lost the contents of my stomach all over the sidewalk.

I couldn't be next to them anymore and yet, I couldn't leave. So instead, I stood up and leaned against the nearby streetlamp. My leg shook nervously and I was doing my absolute best to keep my nails out of my mouth. I have all sorts of bad habits like that.

Well, time ticked on. I watched each minute on my phone pass by without so much as a flash of red or blue light. I began to wonder if the police thought my call was a prank. Mosquitoes were nipping at my skin and driving me positively wild, I just couldn't keep still. I desperately wanted to get home, but I felt it was my civil duty (and the duty of being a good human with a proper moral compass) to stay by the poor individual next to me.

A subtle breeze played with my hair and suddenly, I was hit with something. I flinched and let out an audible noise of fright before gathering my composure and looking for the object. As I looked around, I was taken aback when I noticed something… unexplainable on the ground.

A hat.

There was a wide-brimmed, dark colored hat laying at my feet. I reached down to pick it up, I dusted it off and studied it. Were I in a dense crowd, finding such a thing wouldn't normally be considered a strange circumstance. However, here in this particular situation? It was profoundly disturbing.

I was so entranced by the hat, I didn't even sense the pair of hands on my shoulders. When I did, I freaked out and spun around with my arms flailing haphazardly. But nobody stood between me and the darkness.

The hands, however, were still on my shoulders.

I turned again - no change. The hands began gripping tightly. The force being produced was so intense that I knew their fingers were piercing my skin. I tried to kick backwards, but my legs met no resistance; it was like the air itself had me in its control. 

I threw the hat down and attempted to pry the fingers off. Suddenly, I felt a stinging pain in the palms of my hands that stemmed from the tops of my assailant's fingers. It was like little pin pricks poking a plethora of tiny holes deep into my supple skin. I admit, I howled in anguish, but the grip did not let up.

Completely and utterly incapacitated, I did everything I could to break free. Nothing was working and even as I screamed, no sound came out. I could feel a faint warmth trickling down my back and I knew it was blood. The burning sensation on my shoulder was almost enough to bring me to my knees. I managed to stay standing, but lord knows I wanted it to end.

"W - who are you?" I managed to ask through it all.

"When I ask if you see him - you won't notice him at all…"

Their voice was raspy and downward inflected as if each sentence was trailing off into some void. "W - why are you talking like that? Mike?"

"Never dismiss him…"

"What? Mike, I didn't dismiss you! I thought the poem was good; it just needed work!"

The grip tightened once more only this time, it was accompanied by a terrifying bout of hot breath on my neck. Whoever was behind me; they were extremely close.

"He's always lurking and sometimes…" The voice trailed off again as one of their fingers drove into my shoulder skin like a thick needle, "He'll strike all while smirking!" Those last words ended with laughter - the kind that can bring a person to the brink of madness.

I started fighting back again, punching and kicking until I exhausted all of my adrenaline. I wasn't sure if I was going to die or not, but I was on the verge of giving up completely. The pain was rendering me to my knees and the police still seemed nowhere to be found.

My salvation, however, was at hand when a flashing light caught the corner of my eye. I forced myself around to face the road and whoever was gripping my shoulders turned to once again be behind me.

One unit. They sent ONE unit. Maybe they didn't believe me enough to feel like there was a real emergency? I'm not sure how else I could have stressed the fact that someone had died, but here I was - sitting on the ground next to a dead body with an overpowering figure raking my shoulder skin.

The officer stepped out of his car and approached with his gun drawn. He moved slowly with great caution and issued a routine command, "Don't move!"

I winced from the pain and responded quietly, "Help me… the person behind me; they're hurting me…"

The officer appeared confused as he shined a flashlight directly into my eyes, "What? There's nobody behind you. Son, are you on drugs?"

I was completely dumbfounded, "W - what?! No! Somebody is gripping my shoulders so tightly that I'm bleeding! How can you not see them?"

"Son, there isn't anyone behind you; it's just you, me and whoever THIS is on the ground. What happened here?"

I tried to stand up, but the officer ordered me back to my knees. Weakly, I said, "Listen… I was coming back from the Education Center and found them here. I hate to be 'that guy' but something is seriously going on with my shoulders and I can see two hands gripping them. If you can't, then I need you to take me to someone who can!"

"Not even a hospital…"

"Who was that?" Asked the officer in a strange turn of events.

"Y - you heard that?" I asked hopefully.

The officer pointed his gun past me, "That didn't sound like it came from you. Who's there?! Come out now!"

I jerked my body and in an instant, my shoulders were released. Shortly after, a pair of sunken, milky-white eyes appeared in front of my face and were staring directly into mine with great ferocity. The figure had a head not unlike the darkness around us, the difference being they had a wretched smile spread from ear to ear. 

My face washed over with an expression of tremendous fear, but I couldn't tell how the officer was reacting. The being in front of me, the man who was behind me, laughed in such a way that my skin crawled from head to toe. Then, it whispered, "Whoever is near will be beaten and broken…"

I tried to warn the officer, "Run! Get away from here!" But he clearly didn't understand. The being turned its head slowly and in the blink of an eye; it charged at the officer and began to maim his body. The sight was too gruesome to watch and I (not being a complete fool) took the opportunity to sprint away. The noises of the officer screaming only lasted until the resounding snap that followed. 

I can only assume it was his neck.

As I ran, I heard the sound of fast approaching steps from behind me. I was sweating profusely and doing my absolute best to make it home before my pursuer could resume its foul grip on my shoulders.

The footsteps became louder and louder, my heart was pounding like a jackhammer and my feet were hurting from how hard I was taking each running step. I steadied my breathing and narrowed my eyes in focus; it was clear that if I wanted to stay alive, I could NOT stop moving. 

I realized quickly that I was getting closer to my home as I began to recognize the changing scenery around me. I felt that piercing sensation of eyes burning my back with a malignant gaze, but I was so close.

My house came into view and although I felt like I was on the cusp of suffering a heart attack, I managed to rush up my steps and open the door. I slammed it behind me hard enough to shake the entire house and that's when my legs gave out underneath me. I fell down and leaned my back against the door.

No sounds could be heard from outside, I listened intently, but I couldn't hear any footsteps approaching. I worried about whether somehow the man slipped in before I closed the door, but surely he would already have snatched me in his aggressive grip unabated.

Through all my distracted idle thought, I completely forgot about my parents. I still lived with them and they ALWAYS greeted me at the door when I got home. But now, the entire house was dark and they were nowhere to be seen.

I sighed and thumped my head once against the door. A part of me expected the worst, I wasn't free just yet, or maybe I never was. I called out to my mother and father and received no response. My shoulders throbbed deeply as I called out again - still, no response.

I closed my eyes and took several long breaths. I felt like I was losing consciousness, perhaps I had lost more blood than I thought?

The silence was deafening, my head was ringing and my body was aching. But, my entire being stiffened in an instant when I heard that horrendous voice whisper directly into my ear. "I've DONE it too many times to lie, I've done it to family and innocent passersby…"

I groaned and began to cry, "P - please leave me alone…"

"Help is not possible…"

Forced to a crawl, I made my way through the living room albeit very slowly. The wood floor filled my arms and hands with splinters, but the pain in the rest of my body outweighed those minor annoyances. I wanted to get to my parents bedroom. I felt that the further I went into my home, the safer I'd be.

I entered their room - the door creaked open on old hinges. Their light was off, much like the rest of the house, so I had to clamber to my feet to reach the switch. I flicked it and illuminated the room.

Two human mounds were lying flat on the bed, I could not see their faces. I called out to them, "Mom? Dad? Are you guys okay?" I strained my eyes to see them react, but there wasn't a single movement coming from the blanketed mounds.

I crept over to their bed and placed my hand on the mound I assumed was my dad. I couldn't sense him breathing - his body was not rising in rhythm. Reluctantly and with great trepidation, I removed the blanket.

They were both dead. Just like the person on the sidewalk. I reached for my heart and felt it palpitating so hard that each beat was accompanied by a tinge of pain. I buckled over and cried further; it was a sight unlike any other, seeing my parents defaced quite literally.

More silence followed as I stood there puzzled and terrified. I felt the grip return to my shoulders and the warm, wet breathing against my neck. I shuddered and broke down as I heard the voice once more…

"You should have never dismissed me…"

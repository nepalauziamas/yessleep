they say its like a backrooms.but i went through a lot.so thats not scare me a lot to quit a good job.and all i do is sit tight and watch anime.but that day is not that good.so normally i go to home put my casual cloths and head to the apartment(job).as i continue the walking at the footpath.a whole car is burning on the road.its an accident and i ask people around that what happen so they say that its a family car who suddenly goes over control and messed with the road blockers cause its an walking site so any vehicle can not pass

.and remember the car is toyota white.lets move to the point.i was siting there and watching anime and listened a heavy voice like thud and its \*\*\*\*\*\*\* loud.so as a security guy i ran and checked what happend and guess what there's same car and a typical mom who week at driving is sitting in the car.and she is crashed at the door and i asked her mam u okay and she says yeah just .... and said sorry for that. but at that time dont realize that that's the same car but i through that this car is seems familiar but i have a job at parking i see a lot of cars so i forget about it and she parked the car and gone.and i resume the anime and i watching hellsing and u know about the buffering issues.i heard a sound of whispering but i through that's background music and suddenly its starts buffering.and the whispering sound does not goes for a 3 sec.and i suddenly feel a cold air enough to make me pee.

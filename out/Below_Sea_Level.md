   The water is rising more and more. The wooden poles and beach themed walls remain old and rusty. The sand creaking out of cracks in the walls making its way into the water slowly. The old yellow-ish lights flicker and grow brighter, yet dimmer at the same time. Arvin screams. The hot steaming water shoots out of the pipes. Mucky water flows out of the pipes lower towards the ground. The large nearly half a mile maze is flooding more and more. Oddly quickly. It’s horrifying, Arvin knows he might just end up *dead*.

*“I DIDN’T DO ANYTHING TO YOU!”* Arvin struggles as the steaming water rises. His eyes begin to burn from all of the steam. His chopped off fingers splattering out the top of each wound across the walls and dripping into the water. The lights flicker more and more while the water splashes. Arvin swims and stumbles through the seemingly endless maze. “ROBERT PLEASE!” That voice. It just echoes. Through the speakers at least. Robert watches Arvin through each camera. He smiles. He is quite the mastermind, as Robert always thought of himself to be one. And his prime rule? Don’t screw over your boss. Because oh damn, he will certainly screw you over worse. Robert was responsible for all these traps, contraptions, whatever you’d call them. He built it, fixed it, and programmed it. All these traps, everything. Arvin is screaming more and more. He spits out sandy and muddy water. Suddenly, Arvin’s head hits the roof. He is full on swimming now. The water is getting too high. “PLEASE! I’LL DO ANYTHING!” Arvin grasps onto the pipes transferring water throughout the maze. He screams more and more, pulling himself along the pipe looking for a possible exit. 

  The water is right under his chin now. And what can he do? Magically tear pipes apart? Drink all the water? Not happening. Not in a million years. The water rises more and more. He is fighting for survival at this point. No more stumbling through the maze, no hoping that he can get out in time. He cannot even see the border walls of the maze. Not even from this point can he see the end. He splashes as his gashes begin to intensify in terms of pain. The salty water is getting more and more painful on his wounds. That fight did not come in handy, Arvin thinks to himself. He remembers the rifle bullet going through his thigh. Even the crunch in his nose when the bat swung into him, painfully face first. But we can’t worry about that now. Arvin looks around, and begins freaking out again. He splashes more and more again. Swimming so tightly close to the roof. 

  Robert stares through the monitors still, not feeling remorse. “Satisfaction. Something I feel like I am getting the best of.” Robert says with a smirk. He can't help but have a little smile. “Sucks... Oh how much it sucks... To be you.” He says in a mockingly sing-along voice. Raspy, creepy, and dry.

  Arvin tries to swim through the spaces on top of each wall as more water burns his eyes, but suddenly his pants get torn across a screw tightening the walls together. Arvin’s pants tighten around the corroded pole, making it impossible for him to swim away. Arvin tries pushing himself up and out, but his shirt then gets caught on another corroded, wooden pole keeping up the wall. He screams, then backs up into the roof. The water rises more and more, pressing him against the roof harder. He pulls himself over tightly. His pants tear, and become even more tightened on the pole. Arvin’s face is now smushed into the old, dirty concrete roof. Robert watches him through a camera on top of another wall behind him.

  Now with Arvin’s back pressed against the top of the wall and his stomach and face pressed against the roof, he screams louder. Spitting out water that got up his nose and into his mouth. The pressure stiffens him slightly, causing him to go into full panic. Now he is pinned between the walls entirely. His shirt and pants are fully torn and stuck around the poles keeping the walls stable. “NO! NO!” Arvin’s muffled yell bellowed throughout the eye burning, mucky, and near *toxic* water. Robert still watches though, knowing he was a plain rat, there was zero mercy for this case. But why resist the entertainment?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        

  Suddenly, the water hits the roof. It *floods* over his face and into his nostrils. He starts shaking intensely trying to get himself free. *“LET ME OUT! I CAN’T DO THIS ANYMORE!”* Arvin is yet still pinned between the old rusty, half wood, broken up walls. He coughs and gurgles as he hopelessly tries to breathe. “GAHH! BLAH!” The mucky water consumes Arvin, both physically and mentally. Arvin frantically tries to pull himself out of the gap. His muffled weak scream gives Robert the kind of theater show he needs. “AH!” Arvin tears at the roof. “AHHH! NO!” He’s now spitting and gurgling a ton of water as he tries to breathe. More, more, and *more*. 

  The sand is going down his throat as he tries to suck in air. Yet only water comes through. Arvin gains a headache and punches the concrete roof. Yet it only scrapes the wounds he has on top of each, chopped off, dirty finger. He’s shaking like a fish, like he’s got a seizure. But there is no seizure. Just *water*. Arvin tries to tear at the concrete roof. Yet without his fingers, not even a slight scratch in the concrete roof is visible. Only lines of blood. He kicks at the opening beside him, leading back into another area of the maze. But there is no way out. He’s stuck. “Pl-Please!” *“Please..!”* His voice weakens.

  As time goes on, he slowly stops moving. Years of life, living an interesting yet almost normal and nostalgic life, but now all down the drain, *almost literally*. Robert clearly is enjoying what he is looking at, it’s just amazing! ...At least to him? Arvin let’s one last gasp out. His eyes stare up at the vent above him. Then, he smiles slowly. And that’s the end of Arvin Gamik. *“So, now you see.”*

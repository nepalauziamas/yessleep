(Trigger Warning)

I thought we got lucky. Like, really lucky.

My best friend (Maddie) and I both got hired by Apple! It was our dream job; we'd be working at the HQ in San Jose. We were pretty worried about finding a place to live, especially since San Jose's kind of infamous for being a pricey place to live (and that's coming from someone who lives in San Francisco!), but we found a nice two-bedroom apartment twenty minutes away for just two thousand a month! It seemed too good to be true, so we were honestly preparing ourselves for disappointment, but when we got there it really blew us away!

The complex was in a quiet residential area in the Saratoga area, and our apartment was on the first floor, with a nice patio facing a park across the street. When the landlord gave us a tour, I didn't believe what I saw. The bedrooms were really big and nicely carpeted with plenty of electric outlets, and the master room even had a walk-in closet! The kitchen was wide, with plenty of counterspace, and there was even a washer and dryer in-unit!

So obviously, we'd signed the lease almost immediately. Can't let such good luck pass us by!

It was like a dream come true. After years of trying and failing to get a decent job, we applied to Apple on a whim. Neither of us thought we'd actually get hired, but then it happened, and our whole world changed completely. On the day we moved in, I was thrilled to finally be doing what I'd always wanted to do. Maddie's dad rented a big U-Haul and helped us move all of our furniture from our parents' houses. He might be on the older side, but he's still got it, that's for sure. He did all the heavy lifting for us, with some help from Maddie's younger brother Ryan. We did the move two weeks before the start of the fall semester, so their dad suggested he tag along for the week. Maddie apparently offered him a sleeping bag, but he said he was fine sleeping on the couch.

My couch is really comfy tbf.

Once everything was set up, Maddie talked with her dad outside for a while, then stepped inside, a bittersweet smile on her face. She stretched her arms and took a deep breath.

"How's it feel?" I asked. "You've finally got your own place!"

"It feels exhausting," Maddie admitted. "There's still a few things I want to check before I can really get settled in."

"You worry too much," I sighed.

"I concur!" Ryan chimed in, stepping inside behind Maddie. "How about this, then? I'll run to the store and grab some wine, and maybe a board game. Why don't we just kick back and relax tonight?" Maddie seemed hesitant.

"Honestly, if you want to check more stuff, just do it tomorrow. We've been busy all day anyway, and it's getting late," I pointed out. "You literally just said you're exhausted, right?"

"I did say that," Maddie conceded, pursing her lips. From her tone of voice, I could tell that she was still stressing about the move, but there was a hint of resignation in there that told me she'd conceded.

"Awesome! I'll head out now, then," Ryan announced. "Alison, wanna come along? I could use a woman's touch when I pick out the wine."

"You're too young to buy alcohol, aren't you?" I asked, confused.

"I just turned 21 a few weeks ago, remember? It's fine!" Ryan reminded me, turning on his heels and pulling the door open. "You coming?" I shrugged.

"Sure, why not?" I decided. Ryan grinned mischievously, and stepped to the side, holding the door open for me.

Our excursion took a bit longer than I'd expected. Ryan took his time wandering around the stores, chatting with me the whole time.

"I've seen you around all the time, but we never actually get to talk," he'd said as we browsed the board games. "It's too bad, you know? I like you, you're cool." In that game, Ryan picked out a few games he thought would help us get to know each other a bit better. Stuff like *Apples to Apples*, *What Were You Thinking*, and the classic *Cards Against Humanity*. It was looking to be a fun night.

When we got back to the new apartment, we were greeted by an odd clicking sound. Odd to me, at least, but Ryan just got excited. We followed the clicking to my room. The door was open, and Maddie stood in the center of the room, holding up a small handheld device.

"What're you doing?" I asked, bemused. Maddie jumped, startled, then walked over to me and showed me the device.

"I knew it!" Ryan exclaimed.

"Ryan, don't start, it's nothing like that," Maddie said sternly, then looked at me.

"What is that?"

"An EMF meter," Maddie replied. "It tells me the levels of ambient electromagnetic fields in the area."

"Yeah, I'm totally lost."

"It detects ghosts!" Ryan interjected. "EMF readers are a staple of any self-respecting ghost hunter!"

"Don't be ridiculous," Maddie interrupted. "The pricing just felt really strange, so I wanted to make sure there wasn't something we wouldn't be able to see that would cause them to lower prices."

"Like a gho—"

"No, Ryan!" Maddie snapped. "EMF readings can be caused by faulty wiring in the walls, you know. Electricians use these meters all the time as a safety precaution. I checked for radiation, too." Maddie raised up her other hand, which held a bulky yellow tablet.

"A Geiger counter?" I gasped. "Don't you think you're being a bit too paranoid?"

"No, because I found something," Maddie declared. She shifted to the center of the room again, then raised up her EMF meter. The clicking sound started up again.

"It's a ghost!" Ryan yelped. "It has to be! You're literally in the middle of the room, there's no wiring in thin air!"

"Ryan!!" Maddie shouted. "Use your brain! Ghosts aren't real! This just means that the wiring is emitting so much EMF that you can detect it from the center of the room. That could be a serious problem!"

"Damn it, Maddie, you…" Ryan grumbled, glancing offhandedly at me. "Well, fine, maybe that's all it is. But so what? A little magnetism never hurt anyone."

"It's not the electromagnetism I'm worried about," Maddie clarified. "It's the wiring. If it's that bad, it could be a fire hazard. I'm definitely calling maintenance tomorrow and having them check. I'm not getting scammed."

"It's fine, it's fine!" Ryan insisted. "God, you're always like this!" Maddie tensed up at that, and looked like she was about to scream him into deafness.

"Hey, uh, why don't we open the wine and play some games? It's been a long day," I interjected awkwardly. They both looked at me; Ryan's eyes instantly lit up, and he turned back to Maddie.

"Yeah, Maddie!" he added. "Just chill out! Leave the paranoia until tomorrow!"

Maddie opened her mouth to object, then sighed, visibly loosening up once more. "Alright, fine…Forget it, let's just go."

Is that kind of fighting normal among siblings? I guess it has to be, since they seemed perfectly fine just a few minutes later. The rest of the night was pretty fun. I'm like 90% sure we didn't play the games correctly (I blame the wine!), but whatever, we had a good time. Maddie went to bed first; she's definitely an early bird, so she likes to go to sleep early, AKA before midnight. I was super sleepy, but Ryan just kept talking. I don't really remember what it was about, but I do remember cutting him off to go to sleep. The hangover sucked.

Yes, I got drunk on just a couple glasses of wine. Yes, I'm aware how pathetic that is. I'm a skinny girl who almost never drinks, okay? Don't judge me (¬\_¬)

Anyway.

An electrician came by two days later, but he insisted that there wasn't anything wrong with the wiring, and it was perfectly safe. Maddie was still skeptical, though, so she suggested calling an independent electrician, "just to be certain." I convinced her not to, after pointing out that it would be a waste of money if there really was nothing wrong. She really does get caught up on these sorts of things. Which is better than being too lax, I guess, but balance is important, you know?

The next few days came and went. We spent one day cleaning, doing groceries, and other housework like that, but the other days were spent sightseeing around San Jose. It's a super nice area, and there are some fancy restaurants, too. Not very affordable, but that would change once we got our first paychecks. Ryan actually bought me a gift on his last night! I figured it must be a board game, based on the shape of the wrapped box. He waited until Maddie went to sleep, then presented it to me just as I was about to go to bed.

"Aww, thanks, Ryan! That's so sweet!" I said gratefully, then put the gift down on the table. "We can unwrap it in the morning, so Maddie can see it too."

"Why don't you open it right now?" Ryan suggested.

"It's late," I pointed out. "Plus, Maddie's already sleeping."

"Just trust me," Ryan said, smirking. "Maddie wouldn't really like it."

I thought his remark was weird, but my curiosity had been piqued, even more so than my sleepiness. I slowly unwrapped the gift, then pulled out the box.

It was a Ouija board.

"What the…"

"Aren't you curious?" Ryan said. "It'll be fun."

For context, I didn't necessarily believe in ghosts, but I didn't believe they weren't real, either. I was pretty neutral, I guess; I'd just never thought about it before. It's not like I'm super religious, but the thought of ghosts and spirits still made me uncomfortable. But I figured that if this EMF anomaly or whatever was a ghost, it would've done something by now. We'd been here a whole week, after all. Kids used Ouija boards for fun, anyway; they're literally in the toy aisle at Target!

"Sure, why not?" I conceded. As weird as this felt, I wasn't totally surprised; Ryan had said during one of the games that Halloween was his favorite holiday, so this kinda fits him, honestly.

"Yes!" Ryan exclaimed, then covered his mouth. "Sorry…I shouldn't be too loud. My sister's asleep. Come on, let's set up where our ghost's presence is strongest." I nodded, and led him to my bedroom, switching on the lights. Ryan came in behind me, carrying the Ouija board.

"You guys have any flashlights or candles? You know, for ambience," Ryan inquired.

"Uh, maybe? Maddie might have a flashlight, but she's asleep," I replied.

"That's too bad," Ryan mumbled. "Oh well, we don't need them!" He sat down cross-legged in the center of the room, right beneath the lights. I sat down across from him as he pulled out the Ouija board from the box, unwrapping it and setting it up between the two of us. It was made of a light-colored wood, engraved with words and letters and numbers.

"So how do we play, exactly?" I asked.

"It's not a game," Ryan whispered ominously. "Don't call it a game; the spirits will get mad."

"Haha, very funny—seriously though, how does it work?" I continued.

"We set the planchette—the little wooden triangle—on the board and move it around a bit to warm it up," Ryan explained. "We both lightly put our hands on it. I say some stuff, then we can ask questions. I'll be the main questioner or medium, so I can show you how it's done."

"Uh, okay," I mumbled. He set the planchette down, then slowly dragged it in a circle around the wooden board, scratching against the wood. He circled the board once clockwise, then once counterclockwise.

"Negative spirits are not welcome here," Ryan intoned. "This session will only welcome positive energies." He then looked at me. "What should I ask first?"

"Oh, uh…is anyone here?" I replied.

"Is there anyone here?" Ryan echoed. We sat and watched the board…and watched…and watched……

"It's not moving," I observed. "You're supposed to move it, aren't you?"

"What? No," Ryan objected. "The *spirits* move it."

"So ask it something else, then," I recommended. Jeez, this was his idea, wasn't it? He didn't set this up just to let me down, did he?

"Will you speak to me?" Ryan asked. We watched the board…and then the planchette moved. It *moved*. Our hands were still touching it as it slid roughly across the board.

NO.

"Looks like it doesn't like me," Ryan said lightly. "Maybe you should try being the medium. It's your room, after all."

"I don't know how."

"You just saw me do it," Ryan pointed out. "Just do what I did." Oh, I get it. He wants me to feel like I'm in the lead. Ryan looked down at the board, then pushed the planchette to the "goodbye" marker at the bottom of the board, lifting his hands. "There we go. Always say goodbye, even if you didn't get a response. It's polite." He turned the board around, facing me. "Your turn."

"Um, okay…" I mumbled, setting my hands down on the planchette. Ryan set his hands down after mine.

"First, you warm it up," Ryan reminded me. Nodding, I moved the planchette around in a loop. It was surprisingly light, and ran across the board like butter. I did another loop; he had done two loops, so I figured I'd do the same.

"Now you repel evil with a warning," Ryan whispered. I nodded again. What was it he'd said before?

"This is a positive space," I recited. "Evil spirits are not welcome here." I looked at Ryan. "…Did I do it right?"

Ryan nodded approvingly. "Now we ask it questions."

"Alright," I replied. "Um…Will you talk to me?" We watched the board for a moment, then the planchette began to move. A sudden chill went down my spine, and I could hear the quiet hum of the air conditioning. Some timing; the vent must be pointed right at me. The planchette came to rest.

YES.

"It's listening," Ryan observed. "It likes you."

"Okay, cool, so…I mean, what should I even ask it?"

"Whatever your heart desires," Ryan said, smiling. Wow, how helpful.

"Alright," I said. "Um… Do you like me?" Again, the planchette moved, and again, the chill.

YES.

"You don't have to stick to yes-or-no questions, you know," Ryan pointed out. "You really can ask it anything."

"Oh, got it," I said. "In that case…how about your name? What is your name?"

After a moment, the planchette began to slide across the board, spelling out a name.

C-A-S-P-E-R.

"Ha!" I laughed. "Casper the friendly ghost!"

"That's adorable! You've got your own ghost boyfriend!" Ryan teased.

"That's just weird," I remarked. I know he meant it as a joke, but just the thought is kind of disturbing.

"Ask it, then," Ryan suggested.

"…Are you my friend?" I asked. I wasn't about to entertain Ryan's "ghost boyfriend" idea, so I went with something more neutral instead. The planchette began to move again.

YES.

"See? Told you!" Ryan affirmed.

"When were you born?" I asked. More movement, after a short pause.

1-9-4-5.

"Do you live here?"

YES.

I paused, trying to think of another question. Well, if it's supposed to be a ghost, then it should be able to answer ghost questions, right? I'm sure that's what Ryan was expecting, anyway.

"How did you die?"

"Woah, that's intense," Ryan remarked. "I feel like—huh?" The planchette began to move again, spelling out an answer.

S-T-R-A-N-G-L-E-D.

"Brutal," I commented. "Alright, next question: when did you die?"

1-9-6-8.

"Okay…Where did you die?"

H-E-R-E.

"Wow," Ryan mumbled.

"I'm impressed," I replied. "You came prepared."

"That…wasn't me," Ryan stammered. "That was Casper." Hearing him say that made me shiver, if only for a moment.

"If you say so," I said dismissively. "Alright. Can you show us that you're really here?"

"Ooh, you don't want to ask those kinds of questions," Ryan warned. "They invite unwanted activity."

"Too late," I said, and the planchette began to move.

YES.

At that moment, the lights flickered, and the room went cold. I yelped in surprise, nearly falling over.

"Woah, woah!" Ryan exclaimed. My heart was hammering in my chest as a sudden fear flooded through my body.

"OKAY! I'm done, I'm so done, I'm SO done with this," I decided. I dragged the planchette over to "goodbye," then kicked the board away. Ryan looked concerned, and scooted over to my side.

"Hey hey, it's alright, it's just a game," Ryan said calmly.

"You said that wasn't you!" I snapped.

"Well, yeah, because it wasn't," Ryan said.

"THAT'S NOT HELPING!!" I shouted.

"Relax, relax! It's nothing paranormal, I promise!" Ryan paused, gazing into my eyes with a sincere expression on his face. "It's this neat trick with your brain, see. You ask a question, and your subconscious causes little muscle twitches that make you move the planchette. That's all it was, really. Kids do it all the time. It's even used in therapy."

"But the lights and the cold—"

"The air conditioning kicked on, that's all," he assured me. "It probably caused the power to flicker for a second. Old building and all that. Look, I know I'm always talking about ghosts and stuff, but none of it's real, alright? I just think it's fun. I didn't think you'd actually get scared."

"I…" I paused. All of a sudden, I felt a wave of embarrassment run over my face. I'm an adult; I'm not supposed to get scared by a little kids game. I let out a nervous laugh. How could I be so silly?

I was broken out of my thoughts by Ryan's warm, gentle touch on my shoulders.

"Forget about the board, Alison…Why don't we try something else?" he whispered. I could feel his breath on my face. And then…

He was kissing me.

Maddie's little brother was kissing me.

"Woah!" I exclaimed, pushing him back. "What're you doing?"

"Just trying to show you that everything's alright," he said, leaning in for another kiss. I pushed him away, then scrambled to my feet.

"No!" I declared. Ryan stood up, taken aback by my sudden outburst. That's why he wanted to stay the week. God, I felt so stupid. I've always just seen him as Maddie's little brother, I never thought he'd try something like this.

"What's wrong?"

"You tried to kiss me just now!" I pointed out.

"Sorry…Not in the mood, I guess?" he asked innocently, chuckling. "Well damn, there go all my hopes and dreams."

"NOT IN THE—" I took a deep breath. "You're Maddie's little brother!"

"It's not like I'm *your* little brother," Ryan pointed out.

"Stop—just no!" I continued. "That's why you waited for Maddie to go to bed, isn't it? That's why you wanted to stay the week? That's why you got me that gift?!"

"Well, to be totally honest, I've always kinda liked you," Ryan confessed.

"I've known you since you were, like, five! This is just weird!"

"It doesn't have to be," he said softly, stepping uncomfortably close to me. "Besides, this is just between us…"

"Ew, no! I said NO!!" I yelled, shoving him back with a bit more force than I'd intended. "No means no!"

"It's fine, I promise—"

"Get out." I was seething with silent fury by then, and having him alone with me in my own bedroom was making me increasingly uneasy.

"But—"

"GET OUT!" I screamed. He backed towards the door, carefully avoiding making eye contact.

"I… Sorry, Alison. I screwed up," he said sheepishly, slipping out the door and leaving me alone in my bedroom.

I don't remember what I did after that. I just remember waking up with a headache and a guilty conscience. Maybe I overreacted. I've only dated once before, and the guy was super shy, so maybe I'm just not used to guys being more assertive. It's not like I hated Ryan, either; I've always sort of seen him as my own little brother. It's just that the thought of us being together like *that* feels icky to me.

So I went and apologized.

When I left my room for breakfast, Ryan and Maddie were both finishing theirs. I waved awkwardly at them, then threw some strawberry Pop Tarts in the toaster. Maddie left to use the bathroom a moment later, leaving me and Ryan alone.

"Ryan…" I greeted quietly. "About last night…"

"It's fine," he said quickly.

"No, it's not that. I just…I might have overreacted a bit last night. It's just that…I know you're not actually my brother, but I've always felt like you're family. Like, Maddie's always been a sort of sister to me," I explained. "I just wanted to apologize. For yelling like that."

"Really, it's fine," Ryan replied, his expression growing serious. "I shouldn't have acted the way I did. I'm sorry."We both stood silently together as what was probably just a few seconds seemingly stretched into a few hours—until Maddie emerged from the bathroom, breaking the stalemate. She made a joke, we laughed, and the next few hours before Ryan's departure went perfectly. I thought that was the end of it. By midday, I'd already forgotten about last night's events. I'd forgotten all about Casper and the Ouija board.

Until the voicemail.

That night, I found Maddie sitting quietly on the couch. She wasn't watching TV, or on her phone, or anything; she was just sitting there. When I asked what was wrong, she pulled out her phone and played a voicemail. It was from her mom.

"Hi Maddie," she greeted. Her voice sounded weak, distraught. "It's about Ryan…He got into an accident. A bad accident." She paused, sobbing. "He's alive, just barely, but…the doctors say there's serious brain damage. The air bags blocked the doors, and the seat belt was strangling him, and if they hadn't gotten him in time, he would've…" She trailed off. "Just…please, call me back." *Beep*.

I don't remember what I told her after that, because there was only one thing on my mind:

He was strangled. Just like Casper. That can't be a coincidence.

And Casper confirmed my suspicions. Right around midnight, I pulled out the Ouija board again and spoke to Casper, just like Ryan and I had done the night before. And I came prepared.

"Did you do it?" I asked, my voice shaking, hoping against hope that this was all just a game, and his accident was just a coincidence. But then the chill returned, and this time I knew it wasn't just the air conditioning.

YES.

"Why?"

The planchette started moving, so slowly it was agonizing.

P-R-O-T-E-C-T.

"Protect who?" I wasn't sure I wanted to know the answer.

Y-O-U.

"I don't want your protection!" I declared. "It was fine! We were fine! We moved on!" To my surprise, the planchette began to move in response.

NO.

My heart stopped.

"No? What do you mean 'no'?! I was a bit annoyed, sure, but God, I didn't want him dead!!" There was no response. "Please leave him alone!" The planchette slid again.

NO.

"LEAVE HIM ALONE!! Why are you doing this?! What do you WANT?!" A moment of stillness, then the planchette began to move again, spelling out a word that, in any other circumstances, would have been reassuring. But now? It just terrified me.

J-U-S-T-I-C-E.

—

I don't know what to do. I'm scared Casper's going to kill Ryan, and I'm not sure there's anything I can do to stop it. Apparently Casper wants to protect me, but if his "protection" is just code for "kill anybody that even slightly annoys me," then I really, really don't want it!

God, what am I supposed to do?!

“I think I’m going to get the job as principal next year,” I said to my husband as I ate dinner. He sat quietly as usual, unblinking and attentive. “The interview isn’t until next week, but Superintendent Rance keeps talking to me about *when I’m in charge*, so that seems promising.”

My husband, Walter, stares at me with a lopsided smile and I return the grin. Our son, Aaron, sits across the table from him with his usual mischievous grin. Dinner with them is the best part of my day and I hope they know that. No one makes me feel more special than they do.

“I’m not sure I’m ready, though,” I continued. Both of them gazed at me with anticipation as I continued to discuss my future. “Being a vice-principal is already a lot of pressure, but running an entire school just seems like a whole new world of stress. The pay raise would be great though! The budget is getting kind of thin since we… I bought the new house.”

My husband and son just continued to smile at me as I ate the rest of my dinner in silence. Their coal-black faces gleam cheerily at me as I collect my dirty dishes and carry them from the table to the sink. From their perch on the kitchen table, I can see the small soapstone carvings of my husband and son.

It was sad, but still, it was comfort.

Walter and Aaron died three years ago when our old house caught fire. While I was away in Orlando for an educator's conference, the electrical outlet in our kitchen downstairs had set the house ablaze and trapped them in the upstairs bedrooms. The fire investigator had tried to tell me what had happened but I fell to pieces as he tried to explain how Walter had tried to save Aaron.

I just couldn’t listen. Those two hung the stars in the sky for me. When they died, I lost everything in the world that I loved most. Our entire life is filled with grief of one variety or another, but in one fell swoop, an entire lifetime of grief fell in my lap.

It almost broke me, too. But then I found the statues.

Friends and family were kind enough to try and salvage what little bit could be found in the charred carcass that was our home. After the top floor was demolished to make the remains safe to enter, they went to work searching for keepsakes and salvageable pieces of our lives together. By the end of the effort, there was less than a shoe box full of memories.

I’m eternally grateful for the people who sifted through the ashes of my life and for the few precious things they found. More than anything, I’m grateful for the statues.

Walter owned a company digging water wells across the country. He spent countless evenings trying to tell me about his work, but I was so often preoccupied that I don’t recall many details. I did my best to listen to him but thoughts of an upcoming staff training or forgotten tasks always haunted my mind when he discussed work.

Man, if I could turn back time to hear just one more story about a Texas ranch water well, I would hang on to every word.

What I do remember clearly was the numerous amount of trips Walt would take overseas to dig wells in developing countries. I always teased him that it was a tax write-off to see foreign lands and he would laugh it off. Walt was kind-hearted. We lived an exceptionally fortunate life and it was important to him to give to those who hadn’t lived the kind of life we were afforded.

Three years ago, Walt traveled to Niamey, Niger. It was an African country I didn’t know very much about, but Walt was over the moon about the trip. For all of the work-life discussions that I drifted out on, hearing him talk about traveling for relief work always kept my attention.

Aaron hung on every word, too. He idolized his father. Rightfully so. Walt was one in a million. And Aaron was too. I was so lucky to have had them.

Walt was gone for three weeks. Aaron, seven years old and crestfallen that his hero traveled overseas without him, stayed home with me. We talked daily about what we thought his father was doing and all of the amazing things he had seen.

Evening text messages kept us up to date on his location and sent messages of love. We missed Walt, but as any mother with a son knows, the time with a little boy is precious. You have to take in those innocent years before they grow into serious men.

Each night before bed, Aaron would pull a piece of paper out of his pocket and read it intently. He would wander the house as he glanced down at the folded note and nod occasionally. Once he had made a full trip around the house he would sit next to me in the living room and slide the note back into his pocket.

“What’s that, buddy?” I asked him.

“It’s a list dad gave me before he left,” he said with a serious look on his face. “He said I had to do everything on the list every night to help you.”

“May I see it?” I asked with a chuckle. “It must be very important!”

Aaron smiled and handed me the list. I unfolded it and started reading.

*Dear Stinker,*

*I’m going to need you to take care of some things while I’m gone. Please follow all of the steps each night before bed until I get back. I’m counting on you!*

1. *Check all of the doors and be sure they are locked.*
2. *Turn off the lights in empty rooms.*
3. *Make sure the dog has plenty of food and water.*
4. *Keep mom safe! She gets scared when I’m gone, so be brave!*

*I love you, buddy! Sneak a cookie when mom isn’t looking. She’ll catch you anyway, but I bet she’ll let you finish it! See you soon.*

*Love,*

*Dad*

When Walter returned from Africa he told Aaron and me of all of the amazing places he had been and the wonderful people he met. All through his stories, I could see Aaron’s eyes transfixed on the duffle bag by his father’s feet. He knew there were gifts inside and did his best to listen patiently.

After Walter finished telling us about his trip, he kneeled on one knee and unzipped the tattered duffle bag. Fishing around inside, he brought out a colorful beaded necklace and handed it to Aaron. His eyes sparkled with a fascination for the trinket his father had brought back from overseas. With a quick thank you, Aaron darted to his room to add it to his collection of items his father had brought back from his travels.

“And for you,” Walter said as he pulled a box from the bag. “I have something handmade and one of a kind.”

Walter placed the box on the counter and gestured for me to open it. Sliding the lid off and pulling away pieces of crumpled pieces of newspaper, I could see three stone figures nestled at the bottom of the container. A man, a woman, and a little boy. Cut from blue-grey stone and polished to a high gleam, I marveled at how much they looked like us. Our family.

“Our translator showed us a stone carver when I asked about a custom gift for you,” Walt said as he brushes a scrap of paper away from the figure of our son. “The craftsman said that the carvings will watch over our family when any of us are away and keep them safe. Seemed like the kind of thing you would enjoy.”

\*\*\*\*\*

I stayed in bed a majority of the time for the first six months after Walter and Aaron died. Initially, I lived with my sister and brother-in-law. They did their best to help me through the grief, but they rarely left me alone. No doubt my attempts to withdraw alarmed them, but grieving with an audience was difficult.

The homeowner's insurance policy allowed me to purchase a modest home in the suburbs outside of town. My sister begged me to stay with them longer, but I declined. The healthier thing to do would have been to stay with them longer, but I needed space.

Boxes of unassembled furniture, home decor, and kitchen necessities filled the new house for months. Family and friends had been kind enough to take me shopping for new things, but once they arrived I could never muster the willpower to begin putting the pieces of my life together. My old life had been so well built. Our future was certain. We were blessed.

No one prepares you to lose everything and be left behind to start from scratch.

At the six-month mark, some unusual things started happening. The box of mementos from the house fire had been sitting on the kitchen counter since I moved into the new house. While I had already looked through the assorted photos and knick-knacks that had been collected, I hadn’t unpacked them.

I had just gotten out of bed and headed into the kitchen to fix a cup of coffee when I saw that the lid of the box was sitting to the side. As I walked closer I could see that some of the contents had been shuffled around. I was puzzled but assumed that I must have looked through it recently and forgotten to close it. Lifting the lid to put it back in place, I was startled by the two obsidian figures sitting on the counter.

Black eyes gazed at me from beneath the lid. A lopsided smile and mischievous grin I was so familiar with sent a cold chill running up my spine. The soapstone statues of my husband and son sat on the counter, oriented in my direction as if they had been waiting for me.

My mind raced. I had no memory of opening the box or looking through the contents. There was little chance I had taken the statues out and placed them on the counter. My new house had a security system which I armed each evening, so the odds of an intruder rummaging through my things were equally as unlikely.

Palming my cellphone, I considered calling my sister and brother-in-law to ask if they had been to the house recently without my knowledge. My thumb was scrolling through my contacts when I decided against it. The two of them had spent such a great deal of time worrying over me that I didn’t want to give them any additional cause for concern over my mental state.

Scooping the two stone sculptures up, I prepared to place them back into the box when my eyes met those belonging to the statue of Aaron. Even made of stone, the eyes still sparkled with wonder and amusement. The mischievous smirk made me smile even as the tears of despair filled the corner of my eyes.

I knew at that moment that I couldn’t place them back in the box. Hiding them there would no more heal my spirits than the months of dwelling in my darkened bedroom had. While my heart ached as I looked at the two stone carvings, I also began to feel a sense of happiness, almost as if I had them back in some small way.

From that moment things began to improve slowly but surely. Boxes that had gathered dust for months were opened. IKEA furniture was assembled and put in place. My husband and son sat atop the kitchen counter where they had a view into the open dining room and living room. Their intricately carved eyes kept a watch as my new home slowly came together.

I even found myself beginning to talk to them. When I completed a piece of furniture, I would ask the carving of my husband where he thought I should place it. A small voice in my head that sounded so much his would give me an opinion. More often than not, I adhered to the imaginary answer. Walter always had a good sense of how to put a room together.

After a lot of internal struggle, I decided to end my bereavement leave from school. Returning to work had lifted my spirits as well. The students and faculty were extremely kind and welcomed me back warmly. My grief wasn’t gone, but the weight was becoming manageable.

When I returned home from school, the carvings of my husband and son were always waiting for me on the kitchen counter. It didn’t seem to matter whether I entered the kitchen from the garage door or through the living room from the front door. Walter and Aaron always seemed to be facing the door I walked through as if to greet me.

Exactly when I started eating dinner with them on the table, I can’t be sure. I spoke to the statues daily about my experiences and feelings. In my mind, I knew they were only sculptures of my family, but treating them as if they were my son and husband comforted me. There is no doubt in my mind this wasn’t a healthy coping mechanism, but it got me through my days with a greater deal of ease.

A year after their deaths and I was functioning on an almost normal level again. Where initially my every waking moment was filled with thoughts of them, I was now able to focus on required tasks again. Walter and Aaron always crept back in, but their memories were a source of joy and motivation rather than an anchor dragging me farther under. And I always knew the end of my day would result in a quiet dinner with their effigies.

It was also around this time when unusual things began to happen more frequently with the statues. Nothing overtly terrifying, but unsettling nonetheless. One morning I misplaced my car keys. School started in less than half an hour and I was dangerously close to being late. Usually, I left them sitting on the kitchen counter, but this morning they were nowhere to be found.

After more than ten minutes of frantically searching for my keys, I was startled by a loud noise in the kitchen. It sounded like a bowling ball had fallen onto the tile. Heavy clacking like the sound of stone on stone echoed down the hallway followed by the jingling of metal.

Rushing into the kitchen to see what happened, I saw the statue of my husband sitting in the center of the kitchen floor. Next to it were my car keys. I had walked through the kitchen at least a dozen times during my frantic search for them but there they sat. Scooping the keys from the floor and placing the statue of my husband back on the counter, my mind raced.

As I looked toward Walter’s statue, I was transfixed by the lopsided smile. It almost seemed to say, “*You’ve got to keep up with your keys, Emily. What would you do without me?”*

All of the doors were locked. No one could have come inside. Even if they had, what burglar would locate your car keys and move a keepsake into the center of the floor.

It consumed my mind for the entire work day. Were the statues moving? Was I losing my mind? The thought terrified me.

Since their removal from the box, the statues of my family had either been on the kitchen counter or the dining room table when I ate dinner. While I would occasionally move them to clean the kitchen surfaces, they kept their watch from there. Over time, though, they could more frequently be found in different places.

One evening, I was awoken by the sound of the squealing of door hinges. A habit from college when I had too many roommates, I had always slept with my door closed. When my eyes focused in the dark I could see that the door was only ajar maybe five or six inches. The light from the security system panel blinked green in the darkness of the room, showing that the exterior door alarm was still armed.

I moved my arm to the nightstand to turn on the lamp when my forearm unexpectedly bumped into something hard. It fell over onto the wooden surface of the table and the noise made me jump. Bolting up in bed, I again reached for the lamp and turned it on. The statue of Walter lay on its side, smiling and gazing at me. Aaron sat just behind him, smiling as well.

As I walked to the kitchen holding the two stone effigies, my mind retraced my steps before I had gone to bed. I ate in the dining room with the statues, took them to the kitchen while I washed dishes, and went to brush my teeth. There was no memory of having brought them to the bedroom. The thought had crossed my mind thousands of times to leave them there to watch over me as I slept, but I had drawn the line there.

I spent so much time talking to the inanimate objects that I knew there had to be a limit somewhere. Still, I must have moved them into the bedroom with me. Perhaps I had spent so much time talking to them throughout the day that I was inadvertently picking them up and placing them in different places throughout the house.

A cold chill still rattled my bones as I placed them back on the countertop. They smiled at me as always, but now, those smiles filled me with [fear and discomfort.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gtripp14/comments/uyezti/making_it_easier_to_keep_track_of_my_new_releases/)

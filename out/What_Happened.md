 *‘What happened?’*

&#x200B;

That’s what they asked me after it was done. *‘What happened?’*

You’d think that question wouldn’t be so hard to answer… 

&#x200B;

At the time, I didn’t really have a response… Where the hell would I even begin? I told them what I could but… Well… How could I have explained it all in a way that made any sense? I mean, I tried… But with it all so fresh in my mind, I’m not sure what I said was anything even remotely coherent. Hell, I’m not even sure they believed me. I probably wouldn’t have.

*‘What happened?’*

I never thought that would be such a loaded question…

&#x200B;

My name is Duane King and I’ve been a detective on the NYPD for five years. Specifically, I’m in the Organized Crime division. Ever since I was a kid, I always wanted to be the cowboy cop who took down the mob, like the badasses in the old action movies I grew up on… Well, this was about as close as I was going to get. 

&#x200B;

I’m not going to claim that my job’s any more interesting than it is. Don’t get me wrong, I’m proud of the work I do. But we’re not exactly going toe to toe with the likes of Lucky Luchiano, John Gotti and Al Capone these days.

&#x200B;

Organized crime has a long, storied history around the world and New York is infamous for it. But despite what the movies and TV shows might have you believe, most of the organizations out there these days aren’t believed to be anywhere near as powerful as they used to be. They’re all still around and they’ve still got power… Chances are they’ll never truly die. But it’s not the same as it was a few decades ago. Still, I guess people can’t help but romanticize the classic mobsters, just like they romanticize some of the outlaws of the old west and I’d be lying if I said I was immune to it too… It’s a fascinating subject.

&#x200B;

But of all the famous mobsters I’ve heard people talk about over the years… Nobody ever brings up the only one who’s still active. Nobody ever talks about The Gentleman.

&#x200B;

The Gentleman (nobody seems to know his real name) technically isn’t part of any major organized crime syndicate, although he allegedly has ties to most of them. Bosses come and go, but he’s always there in the background like a spider in the corner, weaving his web. 

&#x200B;

From what little information we have on him, The Gentlemans organization more or less seems to operate on its own, although just what kind of scale those operations exist on, is unknown. Get used to hearing that word, by the way. ‘*Unknown*’. It comes up a lot, when discussing this guy. 

&#x200B;

Most of what we know about the golden age of mobsters comes from former made men who turned rat. Back in the day, there was always a weak link who talked. But none of those rats ever worked for the Gentleman. He’s been in the background since before I joined the force, and nobody ever really says a word about him. Occasionally you might hear someone mention his operation (which doesn’t even have a name, as far as we know). But that’s it. Hell… Nobody even seems to know what he looks like. The only description I’ve ever heard is that he’s an older British man and that doesn’t exactly pick him out of a crowd. 

&#x200B;

He just exists as this quiet enigma, working in the shadows and nobody really tries to go after him. They used to. But now, they don’t bother. I asked my partner, Brian about it once. He’d just scoffed and said:

  “They know better.”

&#x200B;

Detective Brian Radcliffe was one of the old guard. He was pushing his mid fifties, but was too stubborn to retire. I guess he just had something to prove. He was a barrel chested man with a large head, short military haircut and intense eyes. Even when he smiled, it never really seemed to reach them. He always had a few days worth of stubble on his face and it was rare to see him completely clean shaven.

&#x200B;

He’d given up smoking about ten years back and had replaced it with sunflower seeds. He always had a bag on him, and he’d be chewing them just about constantly. Brian was a good cop. I’d worked with him in the five years since I’d made Detective. He was gruff, but he wasn’t cold or heartless. I liked that about him. 

&#x200B;

The Gentleman was always a sore spot for him though. He rarely ever brought up the subject, but I don’t think a day went by where he didn’t think about it. Every cop has a few stories about a case that stuck with them. Hell, I’ve certainly got my fair share. But I don’t think I’ve ever heard one quite as bad as Brians. 

&#x200B;

About ten years before I’d become a Detective, Brian and his previous partner, Marc, had been looking into a mob shooting. I’m not entirely sure as to the details, Brian glossed over them when telling the story, but they’d determined that the shooter was most likely a man named Emile Santonastasso.

&#x200B;

Emile was an up and comer in one of the families at the time. It was rumored that he’d carried out the hit in retaliation for the victims running some sort of racket that put them on the Gentlemans radar in the worst possible way. Like I said, I don’t really know the details. But Brian swore up and down that had solid evidence that put him at the scene, and they’d even found the gun which was covered in Emiles fingerprints.

&#x200B;

Naturally, Brian and Marc had brought Emile in and Marc was looking to see if he could push Emile into turning rat. I guess he got it in his head that if he pushed the right buttons, Emile would spill something on the Gentleman. It would’ve been a dream come true if he did.

&#x200B;

Only Marc never got the chance to make Emile talk.

&#x200B;

Two nights after they’d brought him in, Marc’s house ‘mysteriously’ caught fire. He, his wife and his teenage son were found inside, although a coroner had determined that they were already dead when fire had been started. Conveniently, most of the evidence they had on Emile vanished at that exact same time.

&#x200B;

The consensus was that Marc had simply brought the evidence home for some reason or another, and it had been burned with his house but Brian never believed that. He was always adamant that Marc knew better.

&#x200B;

Either way… Without the evidence, and with no hope of getting Emile to talk, and the man eventually walked free. Within a month, he’d all but dropped off the face of the earth and Brian was left with nothing. Marc’s murder was never solved. The mob shooting was eventually shelved and officially that was the end of it. 

&#x200B;

Unofficially, Brian was still on the case, always keeping his ear to the ground in case some new lead suddenly popped up out of the ether. I think he knew it was probably pointless but… Well… He just couldn’t help himself and I’m not sure if I can say his tenacity paid off or not.

&#x200B;

A couple of weeks ago, a contact of ours mentioned that he’d recently heard about a pending arms deal through the grapevine. Apparently, someone had been looking to get armed. Just who the buyer was, he didn’t say. But he knew who they were supposed to be buying from.

&#x200B;

Emile Santonastasso.

&#x200B;

The moment that name popped back up on the radar, Brian had to take the case. Our Lieutenant had tried to talk him out of it… But Brian had fought for it. This was an old grudge to him, and I guess he figured this would be his chance to finally close that old case. 

&#x200B;

Eventually, our Lieutenant caved and we were assigned to take down Emile Santonastasso.

&#x200B;

Emile was tall and pushing middle age. He had a wiry build with sandy blonde hair and what appeared to be exactly one facial expression. His mouth moved, but his eyes never did. They had a reptilian intensity you could see from a mile away, and just looking at him, it was hard not to question if you were really looking at a human being. 

&#x200B;

We’d spent a good week or so doing recon on the man and since we’d started watching him, he’d been living out of a hotel in midtown Manhattan. As far as we could tell, he didn’t actually have any residence in the city and according to his records, his listed address was somewhere in Switzerland. 

&#x200B;

According to our source, the meeting was due to happen that coming Friday evening, but Emile was in town dealing with ‘business’ beforehand. Just exactly what that business entailed, we weren’t entirely sure. We tailed him, of course. But it was hard to draw any conclusions just off where he went.

&#x200B;

Most of his time was spent in various expensive restaurants, where he’d come for lunch or dinner and stay for several hours. From what we saw of him, oftentimes he was working on his laptop although occasionally, people would stop by to sit with him and talk. We never got a chance to listen in on the conversations that he had, and the people who visited him were fairly varied. We recognized a few mid-level figures from some of the families, as well as some unknowns we couldn’t identify. Whoever they were, they clearly weren’t the people he was gearing up to meet. Brian’s guess was that he was just laying the groundwork for whatever deal was coming and I figured he was right.

&#x200B;

All in all, we didn’t learn a whole hell of a lot tailing Emile… Although that didn’t mean we got nothing at all.

&#x200B;

See, from what we knew of Emile’s upcoming meeting, his buyers were due to be staying in the same hotel as he was. He’d reserved them rooms on the same floor as his. We reasoned that if they were going to be discussing doing business, they probably weren’t going to be doing it out in the open. They’d want to be behind closed doors, most likely at the hotel itself. We’d seen a few cases in the past where people had used hotel rooms for these kinds of meetings, so Brian and I figured that Emile was probably going to be doing the same. And if we had a bug in there, we could get a front row seat to the whole thing. 

&#x200B;

So we got ourselves a warrant to plant the bug, and while Emile was out on one of his several hour lunches, a team was in his room giving us ears into his private affairs. We planted four bugs in that room and we were sure that by Friday evening, we’d have him.

&#x200B;

Well, Friday rolled around.

&#x200B;

Emile left the hotel at 11 AM he always did, headed over to a steakhouse and booted up his laptop. He stayed there until around 4, when he headed back to the hotel. That was earlier than usual for him. I remember watching him walking back into the building. Brian and I were in a van parked a short distance down the street at the time. The technician with us, a guy named Meyers tuned in to the audio from the bug and a couple of minutes later, we heard Emile entering his room.

&#x200B;

The audio quality was good. Not exactly HD, but good enough for our purposes. We listened as he showered and got redressed. For about an hour after that, he tapped away at his laptop until finally, just before 6 someone knocked on his door. This had to be it…

&#x200B;

We heard the door open, before Emile spoke.

  *“Mr. Joo. Mr Lewis. Please, come in.”*

  *“Emile. You’re looking well. So wonderful to see you back in town again!”*

&#x200B;

I recognized that voice as belonging to Phillip Lewis. He was one of the people we’d seen meeting with Emile during the past week. Lewis was a fairly small fish. He was more of a corporate con artist than a mobster. His name had come up in a few rackets we’d busted, and we’d spoken to him a couple times, but nothing had ever really stuck. Brian and I traded a look, before returning our attention back to the audio.

&#x200B;

 *“It’s good to be back. Bern is nice, but it’s not exactly home.”* Emile had replied, *“Can I get you two a drink? I’m afraid I can’t offer you what you two are usually accustomed to, but I’ve got scotch, wine, cognac, bourbon…”*

  *“Cognac, please.”* The other voice said. I presumed that this was Mr. Joo. He sounded young, with an American accent and a sardonic tone. 

&#x200B;

  *“Cognac it is.”* Emile said, and we heard him going to pour the drinks, *“I’ve been quite busy these past couple of days ensuring everything is arranged. Your shipment should arrive within the next few weeks, as requested. I’m sure your employer will be thrilled to hear that.”*

 *“Oh, she will.”* Mr. Joo said, *“She’ll be along in person to collect when it arrives, and see it off to San Francisco.”* 

&#x200B;

  *“I’m so glad to hear that.”* Emile said, *“Then we’re set and all that remains is the matter of payment!”*

 *“Payment?”* Mr. Joo asked, *“The boss’ll handle that when she gets in. You already got your deposit.”*

  *“So I did. But our policy is clear on this matter. We’ve arranged the shipping. But as I told your employer over the phone, final payment must be received before she comes to collect. I was under the impression that she’d have provided you with the money…”*

  *“And of course she did!”* Lewis interjected, laughing a little awkwardly, *“We have it right here-”*

&#x200B;

I heard movement before everything suddenly went silent.

  *“Emile… I’m not questioning your integrity here.”* Mr. Joo said, *“I’m aware of your policy. My policy however is not to pay the full sum until I can physically see the product. If you want another down payment, then I’m happy to oblige. But I’ve been doing this kind of business a lot longer than either you or my employer have. I’ve been burned a thousand times before, so forgive me if I’m a little more cautious.”*

&#x200B;

Emile was silent for a moment. 

*“Understandable.”* He finally said, *“You know… Your reputation does proceed you, Mr. Joo… I make it my business to know who I’m dealing with, so I can’t say I’m surprised by this. Between you and me, I think a little bit of caution is always wise. But I’m afraid my employer would insist upon the full sum… If you’d like to speak with The Gentleman yourself…”*

  *“That won’t be necessary!”* Lewis said, only to be cut off again by Mr. Joo.

  *“I would tell him the same thing I’ve just told you.”* He said, calm confidence in his voice.

&#x200B;

Again, Emile was silent for a moment. I heard him finishing his drink and setting it down on the table.

  *“Very well then… Sir?”*

&#x200B;

I saw Brian’s eyes widen suddenly. Mine did too. None of our intel had suggested that The Gentleman himself might be at this meeting!

&#x200B;

I heard Lewis let out a startled laugh before speaking.

  *“Wait, Emile that isn’t-”*

  *“Nonsense…”* Another voice said. This one was one that neither of us recognized. It belonged to a man, although it was low with a cockney accent to it.

  *“Let’s put Mr. Joo’s fears to rest…”*

&#x200B;

We could hear footsteps in the recording drawing closer, but as they did the audio seemed to become more distorted. I could hear the other voice… The Gentleman, speaking again but it was impossible to make out what he was saying through the heavy static which turned the once clear audio into just a bunch of deafening noise.

&#x200B;

  “What the hell is going on?” Brian demanded.

  “Hold on, let me clean it up!” Meyers said, toying with the reciever although nothing he did made it any clearer.

  “You’ve got to be shitting me…” Brian cried, “Come on! Fix it!”

  “I’m trying!”

  “Don’t fucking try, do it!”

Brians eyes had gone wild as Meyers struggled to clean up the audio.

&#x200B;

There was a horrible screeching noise from the speakers that made me cover my ears. I saw Meyers flinch before trying to bring the volume down. It didn’t seem to do anything. The screech reached a terrible apex before suddenly, everything cut out. The audio just went dead.

My ears were ringing from that screeching noise. Meyers slowly looked up, before reluctantly trying to get the audio back. No luck.

&#x200B;

  “We’re not getting any signal.” He said, “I think the bug’s dead.”

  “They found it?” Brian asked.

  “I don’t know… We should’ve heard it! I think… Shit, I think something fried it!”

  “Fried it? How the fuck do you fry something like that?”

  “I don’t know! There’s a lot that can go wrong, okay?”

  “Well, what about the other ones? I thought there were four in there!”

  “None of them are being responsive! They’re all offline!”

&#x200B;

Brian looked just about ready to deck Meyers in the jaw. He only barely seemed to stop himself from doing so. Instead, he just threw open the back of the van and stormed out, swearing at the top of his lungs.

  “Just see what you can do…” I said, and Meyers nodded at me. We both knew there probably wasn’t jack shit he could do. 

&#x200B;

Brian was breathing heavily as he stood on the street, his fists clenching and unclenching. I couldn’t tell if he was about to start hitting someone or burst into tears.

  “We had ears in the room…” He said through gritted teeth, “WE HAD EARS IN THE ROOM! THAT FUCKER WAS TALKING! JESUS FUCKING CHRIST THE GENTLEMAN HIMSELF IS UP THERE!”

  “We still got some audio!” I said, “It was worth something!”

  “What fucking use is the audio we got? For all we know, they could just be trading fucking baseball cards up there!”

&#x200B;

  “What about Lewis?” I asked, “We could sweat him. We’re not out of this yet!”

  “Lewis…” Brian spat onto the ground, “We never got shit out of him before, what makes you think he’s going to talk now?”

  “We’ll figure it out. Put a knife to his throat, if we have to. We’ve still got a lead!”

Brian glared at me, still breathing heavily, before shaking his head. He didn’t speak. He just suddenly looked very tired and I watched as he stalked over to the front of the van and got in the passenger seat. 

&#x200B;

  “Just let me know if Meyers gets a fucking signal back…” He murmured, although judging from his tone, he knew that we were done here. I left him to stew and went back to see if I could help Meyers. No luck.

&#x200B;

About twenty minutes later, I got into the drivers seat of the van besides Brian. He’d rolled down the window and lit up a cigarette. He took a long slow drag on it, and otherwise refused to look at me.

  “You alright?” I asked.

  “No…” His response was toneless.

&#x200B;

  “You want some company, or what?”

  “I don’t care…” He replied, taking another drag of his cigarette. He let out a long, low sigh.

  “We’re so close, Duane… So fucking close… I’ve never been this close before and now…”

  “I know…”

  “You don’t. You’re a good cop, Duane… But you don’t know. You can’t even come fucking close to knowing, and you should be grateful that you can’t.”

&#x200B;

He finally looked at me and he looked ready to cry.

  “He killed my friend… He killed his wife, he killed his kid… He murdered them. Marc… He was a good cop. He was a damn good cop. He was a damn good friend… We grew up together. His wife and I grew up together. His son… He called me Uncle Brian… *Uncle Brian*. And this sonofabitch… He killed them. Maybe he wasn’t the one who pulled the trigger. But it was him all the same. And now he’s just walking free… Doing the same thing to God knows how many other people.”

&#x200B;

Brian slowly shook his head.

  “Does that sound even remotely fair to you?”

  “No…” I said softly, “No it doesn’t.”

&#x200B;

Brian took one more drag on his cigarette and leaned his head back into the headrest, staring at the hotel as he did. The street wasn’t that busy. We both watched the hotel… And we saw the doors open.

&#x200B;

I recognized Phillip Lewis stepping out first, with another man at his side. This man was tall and broad shouldered, with a top knot. He didn’t exactly look like someone you’d fuck with although the stranger, presumably Mr. Joo looked oddly shaken. I’d imagined a man with an impish grin… Instead he had a furrowed brow and seemed jittery. Mr. Joo walked a short distance away from Lewis. I could see the two talking although couldn’t hear what they were saying.

&#x200B;

Brian had looked over at them, eyes narrowing as he studied Mr. Joo’s face, seeing if he could recognize it. Although his attention was pulled away when the door opened, and two more men stepped out onto the street.

&#x200B;

The first was Emile Santonastasso. The second was a tall, lanky man in an expensive black overcoat, with wispy white hair. He had a toothy smile and a prominent, curved nose and looked as if he’d once been quite handsome. He sort of reminded me of Michael Caine.

&#x200B;

I knew who he had to be. Both Brian and I did.

&#x200B;

This had to be The Gentleman.

&#x200B;

Lewis and Emile spoke to each other, while Mr. Joo and The Gentleman kept their distance from each other. I got the impression that it was more Mr. Joo, keeping his distance from the Gentleman. They seemed to be heading somewhere down the street, away from the van… Perhaps to dinner or drinks, to celebrate closing their deal. 

&#x200B;

Mr. Joo and Lewis both started a little further down the street, but Emile and The Gentleman hung back by the doors, talking quietly to each other. The Gentleman watched Lewis and Mr. Joo as they disappeared further down the street.

&#x200B;

Emile’s dead eyes however, were focused on us. He’d turned his head to stare directly at the van we were in… And Brian stared right back at him.

&#x200B;

For a moment, all was still. Then I watched as Emile slowly raised a hand to wave.

&#x200B;

He *saw* us.

&#x200B;

He knew we were there.

&#x200B;

I felt my heart skip a beat when I saw that friendly little wave… And I glanced over at Brian. I wasn’t sure what to say… And when I saw the rage boiling over in his eyes, I knew there was nothing I could say. I reached out to try and grab his arm… But Brian was gone before I could stop him. He threw open the van door and stormed out onto the street, staring back at Emile with a burning loathing that I don’t think words can describe.

&#x200B;

That wave had been it… After the way this operation had gone, after bottling up years of anger and grief, after getting so close only to have it pulled away at the last second. That wave was what had finally broken him.

&#x200B;

Detective Brian Radcliffe stared down the man who’d murdered his friend, the man who’d evaded justice and he reached for his gun. I watched him draw it. And I could see that Emile was smiling…

&#x200B;

The Gentleman stood beside him. His head turned slightly to glance at Brian out of the corner of his eye. As Brian leveled the gun at Emile’s chest and fired, The Gentleman moved. Brian fired three bullets. All of them should have hit… But they didn’t. 

&#x200B;

Before any of us could react, The Gentleman had just casually stepped between them. The bullets should’ve hit him, but there wasn’t even a mark on him. No damage to his overcoat, no sign that he’d even been hit. He just stood there, like nothing had happened, wearing a gentle, almost apologetic smile.

  “Now, now… Why’d you have to go and stir things up?” He said.

&#x200B;

Brian stared at the Gentleman, gun still gripped tight in his hands but confusion in his eyes. He steadied the gun to shoot again, but he never got the chance. One minute, The Gentleman was standing beside Emile… The next, he was several feet away, just a couple of inches away from Brian, still wearing that same damn smile.

&#x200B;

I hadn’t even seen him move. 

&#x200B;

Brian took a frantic step back and struggled to adjust his aim. I saw his eyes widening in terror. The Gentleman just kept smiling at him.

&#x200B;

And then…

&#x200B;

Then…

&#x200B;

Well… This is the part I can’t explain.

&#x200B;

This is where I blank when they asked me ‘*What happened?*’ Because I don’t exactly *know* what happened. I’ve had all this time to think over it and I just… I can’t explain it. So I’ll just do the best I can.

&#x200B;

When Brian tried to back away, The Gentleman grabbed his arm. I remember hearing Brian scream in pain, before his body seemed to contort. His eyes seemed to bulge out of his skull. His mouth stretched so wide I could see the skin of his cheeks tearing. His skin seemed to bubble as if it was boiling off. The scream he made…

&#x200B;

Jesus… The scream… Even if I could’ve helped him, that scream left me frozen in fear. I could just watch as Brian seemed to just… Come undone… Blood trickled from his eyes and ears. His entire body seemed to suddenly sag and The Gentleman pulled him closer.

&#x200B;

Brian's final scream seemed to echo… But it eventually faded out and when it was gone… So was my partner. Where he’d been standing just a moment before, The Gentleman was now standing alone. There was just… There was nothing left.

&#x200B;

His eyes shifted to me next and I scrambled back, pressing myself against the van door and gripping the handle, ready to throw myself onto the street if I needed to. The Gentleman stared at me, still smiling the same kindly smile as before.

&#x200B;

It was at that point, that I noticed that there was no one else around… Just me, The Gentleman and Emile, watching everything from a few feet away. The Gentleman’s eyes remained locked with mine and finally, he spoke.

  “You can go.” He said, before finally turning away. 

&#x200B;

I watched as he calmly walked back towards Emile, and I didn’t look away until both of them were gone. Slowly, I saw passersby walking along the street again… Nobody seemed to have noticed what had just happened to Brian… Not that there was anything left to notice. It was as if nothing had happened…

&#x200B;

I checked the back of the van for Meyers, hoping that maybe he could validate what I’d just seen. But there wasn’t so much as a trace of him back there. Just like Brian, he was gone too.

&#x200B;

I was the only one left.

&#x200B;

I tried to key the engine to the van but the battery was dead, as was my phone. My heart was still racing a thousand miles per minute… And it took me a while to compose myself again, before I finally left the van and called a taxi to take me back to the station.

&#x200B;

My Lieutenant has asked me what happened… So has my Captain. I’ve tried to describe it. I’ve tried to make sense of it but I just… I can’t. 

&#x200B;

I don’t think there’s any logical explanation for this. Whatever I saw out there… ‘The Gentleman’... It can’t be human. But if it’s not human, I don’t know what the hell else it could be!

&#x200B;

I don’t know what it did to Brian and Meyers… God… I think… I think maybe it ate them. Melted them down and sucked them up, like a spider or something… I think…? But I don’t know.

&#x200B;

I’m putting in my resignation soon. I think it’s for the best. I’ll never be able to forget what I saw and if I stay on the force… Then I can’t guarantee that I won’t end up just like Brian did. I can’t guarantee that it won’t consume me body and soul… Just like it did to him[.](https://www.reddit.com/r/HeadOfSpectre/)

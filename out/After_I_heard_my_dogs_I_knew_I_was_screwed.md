It started as a normal day. It was the weekend so I was up around 8:30 playing video games, more specifically trying the genocide route in Undertale and making vacation homes in Animal Crossing. I got out of bed around 9 and ate some leftover Chinese from the night before for breakfast. Mom had told me that her and dad were running to Walmart and Menards to get food, a new printer, and a sander since dad was redoing the floor at the bottom of the stairs. I got dressed and then they left so I grabbed my switch and my phone from my room and headed downstairs to sit with my dogs until the got back. 


About an hour passed and I ran upstairs to use the bathroom. As usual, my dogs started barking when I was in there. I heard footsteps on my porch and assumed it was the mailman. I left the bathroom and looked from upstairs to see it was a man and he had turned down the path on the side of my house leading to my backyard. I started slightly panicking so I locked myself in my room and texted my mom
“Mom someone is walking around the side of the house”
It took a minute for her to respond and she said
“Ok, is the door locked?”
“Yes”
“Where are you?”
“Hiding in my room”
I was shaking, half tempted to call the police. That’s when I heard the door unlock
“He unlocked the door”
“Ok, block your door and call the cops”


I had started pushing my bed towards the door when I had started texting my mom and it was right up against the door when he had broken in. I hid in my closet and called the cops. I hid behind my sweatshirts and cosplays so I wouldn’t be visible if he got in. I had to text my mom. 
“Hiding in my closet. Cops are on their way. R u coming home?”
“We’re on our way home. How long will it be for the cops to get there?”
“15 minutes”
I heard the man saying something 
“KoKo, come out and say hi”
How the hell did this man know my name?! I heard him coming up the stairs. 5 minutes. Just hold out another 5 minutes. The operator was still on the line
“What’s going on now?”
“He knows my name, he knows my FUCKING NAME!”
“Is this man known to you?”
“No but he’s upstairs now”


I heard the door open again
“Police! Come down with your hands up!” Thank fuck the police came when they did. He was at the top of the stairs but I heard gunshots.
“Officer down, I repeat Officer down. Send backup”
The man had ran downstairs and into the living room so I unblocked the door and ran out of the house. I was running to the gas station on my block and saw that police cars had been surrounding my house and officers had saw me running. One of them had grabbed me by the arm and asked me,
“Miss, were you the one that called?”
“Yes, he is still inside!”
The cop put me in his car and I sat there. Multiple ambulances showed up, I had heard that multiple cops were killed but the man had escaped. Now he knew where I lived.

 I stayed with my grandparents down the street while my house was being investigated. The police found him 3 weeks later in the abandoned auto shop on my street. They had told me that he was related to me since they had gotten my testimony and fingerprints when when I was taken to the station. He was my biological father and had learned of my adoption. He had came to kill my dad and my mom. He then would have taken me. I’m glad I hid when I did

 

I had this dream a long time ago but ever since it's always been in the back of my mind, never ceasing to exist. I know it's just a dream and *maybe* it has meaning to it, well if you think about it all dreams have some truth to them. Always dreaming about being chased by some creature or killer and dreaming about actually asking out crush but that never actually happens. I wouldn't say this is a nightmare but I would consider it to be a normal "weird" dream.

My grandpa, Bob on my father's side passed away in 2017, I never really got close to him and always regretted that I never got to. I took a lot of regret and guilt when I learned about his passing. I was really close to my grandmother and still is, she is really talkative, giving her the nickname "Chatty Cathy" like the dolls made in the 1960s.

Anyway, I don't remember exactly how it started but we were in my house. In our house we have the front door and a sitting area then through a little arch we have our living room which is directly connected to our kitchen. My grandmother had come over to stay the night with parents already leaving the house a while ago. We talked about what we wanted to do first, so we decided on watching a movie. We started watching a movie, I don't know what we were watching but at some point my younger brother who was playing in the corner of the living room started crying. Before I stood up to go over to see what's wrong my blanket had already been pulled off of me. But I quickly brushed it off and I quickly said "what's wrong?" leaning over him, he didn't say anything, just looked at me and cried. We didn't stop the movie but I just cuddled with my little brother. But as soon as we got comfortable and he had calmed down the tv went to static, I had never seen it done this before.

But before I could do something my grandmother said, "Now stop messing with that thing and leave these kids alone" the room went silent and no sooner than later tv went back to normal, continuing the movie. I don't remember exactly what we did when we finished the movie but I just remember that my grandma was dead silent, not even a peep out of her mouth, it was truly unnerving.

Eventually I think we went our own ways to be by ourselves and just have time alone. But soon the brother screamed and me and my grandma ran and there we saw all over his bunk bed were all sorts of bugs crawling cockroaches and spiders. That's when my grandma lost it, she yelled cursing, "Now you stop you son of a bitch, stop it! They have done nothing wrong! Leave them alone dammit!" And my brother and I just stood there horrified, she stopped and paused, she started to cry.

That's how it ended or at least that's what I remember, it was so weird walking and still feeling weirded out. My grandma has told me she believes in ghosts but never truly saw one for herself. I've never told her about this dream before but every time she gets quiet, I get a little worried.

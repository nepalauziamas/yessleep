Ricky brought another girl home last night. She was the new love of his life. And this time I very much believe him.

He adored her more than words could describe. When he looked at her his glance was full of appreciation of her innocent soul, wrapped in silky skin and the way she tucks her hair behind her ear. Even from afar her ever so loving voice. But there was one part of her he adored most of all, her innocent face. He knew all the nooks and crannies and he adored every line and crease. There were times late at night where he would lay away and watch her rest, absorbing her beauty and falling more and more in love with her with each passing second. 

It was the lips that best captured the expressions of his lover. When they were relaxed the rosey redness seemed to glow with content. Turned down, they were like a treasure map that he used to try and find happiness.  Rather than think of her upset he always imagined her perfect full lips turned up and shining brighter than the sun. It was these lips that let the the words of his lover paint the world around her with beauty. The words of his lover were always tender when she spoke of him and the affection she felt towards him. There was one occasion where her lips let poisonous words ruin the beautiful canvas her voice had painted. It was like a knife had been plunged into his heart when she called him ‘sick’. But this one cruel word made him reflect on her tenderness more sweetly. 

The alarm clock screamed, reminding him that he had to go to work. Hesitantly he took his lover’s head from the pillow and made his way to the kitchen to put it back in the freezer where he kept her safe until he could protect her again. As he carried her head he started feeling hungry, knowing he wouldn’t have time to cook he entered the kitchen and plucked a maggot which had made a home on her decaying shoulder blade which he accidently left to defrost on the countertop. The maggot squirmed in his mouth as he gulped it down but he knew his meal contained a piece of her so he ignored the strange sensation it gave him.

Once her head was safely in her new home he walked into the garage where his decapitated lover’s skeleton was sprawled across his bloodstained table. He knew deep in his heart that this was no place for her beautiful body to lay but he had no other option since she was so delicate and needed a strong support to lie on. He stroked each bone tenderly before grabbing a blood caked bone saw and went to work breaking her skeleton apart like a jigsaw he was about to play with. It was an orgy of flying bone marrow and horror that made his blood boil. Once his work was over he checked the time and had a small internal tantrum that he didn't have time to enjoy her private parts which he had perfectly preserved using a tutorial video on taxidermy.

After rubbing the bones in a meat juice concoction he decided which bones were going to the bears and which bones would be ground down and mixed in with the dog food. Outside the moon was full and shone almost as bright and as beautiful as her glazed eyes. He walked towards the woodland at the edge of his land, it seemed like such a waste for her beautiful bones to be scattered but he knew that like him the bears would appreciate her.

It felt strange for him to have kept a piece of her since he usually disposed of everything but he also knew there was no one he loved more than her and no one he will ever love again. After dumping her bones and storing the rest away to be ground up later, he went for a hot shower to wash away the scent of death from his skin. The water felt good against his skin and it gave him time to think before he joined the vampires who buzz in and out of his store. He wished he could go back to bed and stay with his lover watching her sleep but he had to pay the bills somehow. It slowly drove him mad why he couldn’t let her go like he usually is able to. There has been many before her and there would be many more to come but she was the one he knew he’d never forget. 

I wish I could stop him but seeing him happy is all I can ask for as a mother.

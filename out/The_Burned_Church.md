This is a story about a guy I knew named Jack. 

&#x200B;

Now, Jack and I weren’t exactly close. But we had a lot of mutual friends growing up and we hung around in the same circles for most of our high school years. When those friend groups inevitably started drifting apart as we all went off to college, Jack wasn’t one of the guys I stayed in touch with. It wasn’t anything personal or something like that. It wasn’t even intentional. There were just guys I knew better and hung out with more. Nevertheless, when we happened to run into each other a few years ago, I was still pretty happy to see him.

&#x200B;

He looked like he’d been doing pretty good for himself. He’d gotten a cushy job and was making some good money. He wasn’t married yet but that didn’t really seem to bother him. He seemed like he was doing alright on his own. 

&#x200B;

I invited him out to grab a drink and catch up, and he took me up on it. We hit up a bar not too far from where I lived, drank a few beers and talked about our lives. It was honestly good to just sit and shoot the shit for a while. Jack was a little different than I remembered, a little less boisterous and a little more suave, but I’m sure I wasn’t the kid he remembered either. 

&#x200B;

The night went well for the most part. Admittedly, I was a little annoyed by the fact that Jack kept hitting on the bartender… But he was a single guy and as far as I could tell, she was into it. So I kept my mouth shut and let it slide. After a couple of hours and a few too many beers, I told Jack I was going to call it a night. We said our goodbyes, told each other to keep in touch and I headed out to call a cab. The last time I saw Jack, he was sitting at the bar, sipping a beer and flirting with the bartender. 

&#x200B;

Now, about a couple of months later, I ran into another old friend of mine. A guy named Brad. 

&#x200B;

Me, Brad and Jack had hung out every now and then back in the day, so naturally I asked him if he wanted to grab a drink and obviously he said yes. We headed down to a bar he knew, got a couple of beers and started catching up. We hadn’t been talking for that long when I mentioned that I’d run into Jack lately, and asked him if he’d stayed in touch.

&#x200B;

Well, Brad got this sorta funny look on his face. He was looking at me as if I’d just told him that I’d just seen a fish climb out of the water and walk.

&#x200B;

I asked him what was wrong and he just asked me if I was sure it had been Jack I’d seen. I told him that I was absolutely positive. He and I had talked for the better part of a few hours and I knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that the man I’d talked to that night was the man I’d gone to school with all those years ago. Maybe it was just the light, but I could’ve sworn that Brad had gone a whole shade paler. It looked like all the blood had drained right out of his face.

&#x200B;

I asked him what was wrong and he asked me if Jack had mentioned anything about a place called Point Hope. A campground up north around the Bruce Penninsula. I didn’t remember Jack ever mentioning it while we’d been talking, although to be fair I don’t remember a lot of our conversation thanks to the beer. I said as much to Brad and asked why he wanted to know. He took another sip of his beer and was quiet for a moment, then he told me the following story…

&#x200B;

Now let’s take a minute to first talk about Point Hope. 

&#x200B;

Most people who camp out that way don’t really know about the history of the place and to be fair, there’s not many traces of it left. Back around the turn of the century though, it used to be a small town of maybe about 50 people give or take. They mostly thrived off the logging business and traded with some of the towns further down the river. Outside of that, there wasn’t a lot to see or do out there. The people in town minded their own business. They went to work, they raised their families and on Sunday they went to church like any God fearing folks. For most of its history, there was absolutely nothing special about the place. That all changed on one fateful night in the 1930s, when the local church caught fire.

&#x200B;

The way I heard it, the fire was more than a little bit suspicious. Folks had woken up in the night to see the smoke rising from the building and come to investigate. There wasn’t exactly much of a fire brigade out that way, and the fire had gone far enough that there wasn’t much of a chance of saving the place. But a few locals with more balls than brains had still tried to put it out. But when they tried, the pastor himself stepped in to stop them, holding his hands up and demanding that they stay back and let the church burn.

&#x200B;

So that’s exactly what they did. 

&#x200B;

Now, nobody knows exactly why the church caught fire that night. Obviously a lot of people think that the pastor himself torched the place, but nobody knows why and there’s a lot of rumors floating around about it. 

&#x200B;

See, some folks in town said they saw a strange man going into the chapel earlier that day, carrying a large box of some kind with him. The box could’ve been anything, but people have pretty vivid imaginations. Some say that it was just supplies, others say that it was something to start the fire. But a few people out there will tell you that it contained something else entirely. If you believe such people, they’ll say that the man who came to the church had managed to trap something inside that box. Something so evil, that he had decided he needed to bring it to holy ground in order to properly destroy it.

&#x200B;

According to that legend, he’d begged the pastor to help him, and being a man of the cloth, he’d done just that. They had taken the box down into the basement of the Church to do the deed… But things hadn’t gone as planned.

&#x200B;

Whatever unholy thing was in that box, was a being of such unfathomable evil that God himself could not tolerate its presence in His house. And so, when the Pastor had been unable to destroy it, God had sent forth his divine fire to burn the Church to ashes, as he would rather destroy his own home than allow such a thing to walk the earth. 

&#x200B;

Whatever you believe… The burning of the church spelled the end of Point Hope. They never rebuilt it and in time the townsfolk started to drift away, packing up their lives and leaving their homes behind until Port Hope was nothing but an abandoned ruin. And for a few decades, that’s what it stayed.

&#x200B;

Now, eventually, someone else had purchased the land. Since it was relatively untouched besides some of the old houses, they decided it would make for a good campground. They refurbished some of the sturdier houses to serve as administration buildings or cottages, cleared out some nice camping areas and opened for business. But while they tore down most of the buildings they couldn’t save, they left the charred ruins of the old church alone and nobody’s entirely sure why. Maybe since the old church was still relatively intact despite having been mostly gutted by the fire, they thought they could refurbish it too, and had simply never gotten around to it. Maybe the process of demolishing it would’ve been more trouble than it was worth. Maybe it was something else entirely. Whatever the reason, they ended up just letting the woods reclaim it. Over the next several years, the old church was swallowed up by the forest and more or less forgotten.

&#x200B;

Most of the campsites were nowhere near it, none of the local trails passed by it. It was just an abandoned ruin sitting in the middle of the forest and most of the people who camped at Point Hope didn’t even realize that it was there. But those few who did, would whisper about it amongst themselves. At some point, the old legend about the thing that the pastor had taken to the basement resurfaced and people began wondering if maybe, whatever he’d supposedly brought down there was still there after all these years. A few people had tried to go and take a look for themselves, but just about all of them hadn’t gotten far before they’d run out screaming. Nobody ever actually made it down into the basement to see if anything was there. So the stories and the rumors persisted.

&#x200B;

This is where Brad and Jack come back in.

&#x200B;

Now, Brad, Jack, and a couple other friends of theirs had gone up to Point Hope during their first year of college. They’d rented a camping spot, set up their tents and done some of the trails in the area and according to Brad, it was all going pretty well.

&#x200B;

One night, they’d been having some beers by the campfire when a couple of other guys who’d been camping in the area came to join them. Naturally, they said yes and invited them to sit down around the fire. They’d talked, had some drinks and eventually, the topic of conversation shifted to local legends. One of the guys who’d come to join them got into the history of Point Hope, and he told them about the old burned out church in the woods nearby. 

&#x200B;

Now, the boys called bullshit on this whole thing. They didn’t actually believe that this story was real, let alone that the church was actually still on the campground. But these guys swore up and down they were telling the truth. So, Brad (probably motivated in no small part by the booze) pulled out a hundred dollars from his wallet and told them that he’d give them that money right then and there if they could show him to this supposed burned out old church. The two guys didn’t need to think it over very long before they took the deal.

&#x200B;

They left one of their buddies by the fire to keep an eye on it, while Brad, Jack and the two new guys took some flashlights, got up and walked across the campground, past the offices and towards the edge of the woods. There, they found a small path beaten through the trees. 

&#x200B;

The two guys led them down it, through the thick underbrush, and towards the ruins of the church, and after a few minutes, they found it. Waiting in the woods, its blackened stone walls reclaimed by vines and undergrowth, just as promised.

&#x200B;

The guys let them take a look at it, just to assure them that they weren’t liars and Brad was begrudgingly good to his word and paid the two guys what he owed. With their little drunken bet settled, the two guys started asking to head back. But Brad and Jack weren’t ready to leave just yet. They’d both had a little too much to drink and were feeling brave. Jack especially so. He looked the old Church up and down for a while before telling them that he was going to go in to take a look around. The guys who’d brought them there told him no, but Jack didn’t want to hear it. He had his mind good and set on it and asked Brad if he was gonna go in too. 

&#x200B;

The way Brad tells it, he seriously considered it, before deciding that he was good just staying outside. He’d tried to talk Jack into heading back with them, and even suggested they come back in the morning when there was some more light out and it might be a little less dangerous. But Jack wouldn’t hear it. No, he was ready to go right then and there. And so that’s exactly he did.

&#x200B;

Brad watched him take one of the flashlights and go right up to the front door of the old church. He watched him step through the empty archway where the doors used to be and then… Then he didn’t see anything. The darkness just swallowed him up completely. No sign of light. No sounds. Nothing.

&#x200B;

Brad and the other two guys waited for him to come out… They waited, and waited, and waited… But he never did. There was only silence in the air around them. 

&#x200B;

After about thirty minutes, they started calling out to Jack. But they got no reply. Not too long after, they started talking about going in after him but nobody actually had the guts to do it. After about an hour and a bit, they decided to send somebody for help. One of the new guys went off to fetch the park rangers while Brad and the other guy waited by the church, calling out to Jack and hoping to God they’d hear a reply.

&#x200B;

By the time the park rangers showed up, it had almost been two hours since Jack had gone into the ruins of the church. They sent just about six or seven people in after him, and after searching for the better part of another hour, they eventually found him down in the basement, screaming so loudly that by rights, they should’ve easily heard him outside. But Brad and everyone else present swore up and down that he didn’t hear so much as a whisper from that old church. Not a single sound.

&#x200B;

Obviously, Jack was taken to the hospital and spent a few days recovering before Brad managed to get him to talk about what he’d seen in that old church. At first, Jack had refused to speak at all, let alone say anything about the church. But when Brad finally got the story out of him, this is what he had to say.

&#x200B;

Shortly after Jack had gone into that old church, his flashlight had died. So he’d had to scavenge one of the old candles he found for light instead. From the front door, he’d made his way into the chapel, which was mostly still intact. He’d seen a door at the far end of the chapel, near the altar that he figured would eventually lead to the basement so he’d headed in that direction. But as he’d neared the end of the chapel, he’d heard a man speak to him.

&#x200B;

Jack had looked over, thinking that it was one of the guys who’d led them there. But instead he saw an old man waiting by the altar for him, dressed in the black attire of a pastor. The pastor had stood at the altar, gripping it with white knuckles and screamed at him:

&#x200B;

  *“Turn back! Turn back! For the sake of your life, turn back!”*

&#x200B;

His voice had been panicked, as if he were watching some horrible thing about to happen. Jack had tried to speak to the pastor but he kept yelling, begging him to leave and not to go any further. 

&#x200B;

  *“Turn back! Turn back! For the sake of your soul, turn back!”*

&#x200B;

The pastor paced around the altar like a wild animal, watching Jack intently and fidgeting with his hands. But despite the panic in his movements, he never made any effort to take so much as a step closer to him. 

&#x200B;

Jack hadn’t responded, and after a moments thought, reluctantly made his way closer to the door when the pastor screamed out one last time.

  *“Turn back! For the sake of God, turn back!”*

&#x200B;

Again, Jack didn’t respond. He’d just backed away, stumbling through the door leading out of the chapel. As he did, the Pastor’s frantic pleas stopped and when he looked back, he saw that the man was gone and the altar was completely abandoned. Shaken, Jack had almost heeded the mans advice and turned back. But his drunken bravado and curiosity had gotten the better of him. He needed to see what was ahead of him and so he kept going.

&#x200B;

The doorway off the altar led into a hallway, that eventually led into what looked like it had once been the pastors home. Most of it was charred and dilapidated beyond repair but Jack had noticed an old stove, the ruins of a bed and the remains of some wooden furniture. He had explored the house for a bit before hearing another voice and this time it was one he recognized. He’d looked up to see Brad standing in the pastors old house with him, near what used to be the bedroom.

&#x200B;

He said that Brad had laughed at the state of the house and the church, before telling him that they were wasting their time there and that they should really just leave. He said that he’d even seen Brad go and walk towards the door that led back to the chapel, beckoning him to follow all the way. But Jack didn’t follow.

&#x200B;

He hadn’t heard Brad come in, and as far as he knew, he was still outside the chapel, waiting for him. Whoever this was, they *couldn’t* be Brad!

&#x200B;

Jack tried to talk to him and ask him who he really was, but the other guy hadn’t really replied. He’d just kept repeating over and over again that the church was a dump, it was unsafe, they needed to go. Jack didn’t buy any of it. He kept his distance from ‘Brad’ and went back towards the bedroom. It was then that he noticed the stairs, leading down into the basement.

&#x200B;

As soon as he did, ‘Brad’ became more insistent that they leave. He started speaking in a more forceful tone, demanding that they get out as soon as possible and telling Jack that if they didn’t leave, he’d get hurt and that he’d leave him there to suffer. Jack wasn’t going to have any of that…

&#x200B;

Once he was sure that ‘Brad’ wasn’t going to do anything more than talk, he went down the stairs. As he did, he heard ‘Brad’ go silent. When he looked back, he was gone just like the Pastor before him had been. Slowly, Jack had made his way down the old rotten stairs and into the stone basement. The walls were blackened with soot and the dirt floors were covered with ashes. He’d kept walking, until eventually he found an iron door in among the stone. He stopped in front of it, before reaching out to open it and when he did, he heard a final voice.

&#x200B;

It was not the Pastor or Brad… No, this voice belonged to his own mother.

&#x200B;

Jack looked and saw her there, standing behind him. She was in tears, and was shaking with a grief so intense that she could barely stand as she told him how much she loved him and begged him not to open the door. Jack paused, obviously pretty shaken and just stared at her as she spoke.

&#x200B;

She crawled towards him, tears streaming down her cheeks as with a trembling voice, she pleaded with him to just leave, to go back the way he came, and to just forget about that door. She hugged on to his legs, clutching him tight as she begged him to stop. He kept staring at her, and as he did he remembered the Pastor and ‘Brad’ from upstairs. If they weren’t real, then this probably wasn’t real either… But it didn’t change the fact that it made him pause. He could feel her hands on his leg. She felt real... She sounded real… But he still didn’t move.

&#x200B;

His mother looked up at him, her eyes narrowing in rage. With tears still streaming down her cheeks, she’d screamed at him in the same authoritative tone he remembered from his childhood. She’d demanded he step away from that door and for a moment, Jack almost did just what. But he knew that just as the pastor and Brad hadn’t been real… She couldn’t have been real either.

&#x200B;

His curiosity got the better of him, just as it always had and he turned back towards the iron door, ignoring the desperate screams and sobs of his own mother before he reached for the handle and pulled it open. Just like with the others, his mothers voice went silent as he stepped through the door.

&#x200B;

On the other side, Jack only found an empty room, its walls still blackened from the fire so many decades ago. But that was it. Just the ashes and the silence… Nothing more.

&#x200B;

Disappointed, but with his curiosity finally satisfied, Jack turned to leave, but when he did he saw one last figure at the door. 

&#x200B;

A smiling man who looked exactly like him.

&#x200B;

Jack stared at him in shock for a moment before his candle suddenly flickered and died. He heard the other man laugh before watching the iron door slam, trapping him in the room. He ran to it and tried to force it open. But it wouldn’t budge. He punched it, kicked at it and screamed for help. But nothing happened.

&#x200B;

For hours, he pounded on the door. He clawed at it and screamed so loudly that his voice had started to go hoarse… But nothing happened. The door did not open until the park rangers came for him a few hours later. 

&#x200B;

According to Brad, Jack was never really the same after they got him out of the church basement. He didn’t talk as much and he didn’t eat or drink unless they made him. He spent a few months in the psychiatric ward back at home until eventually, Brad found out from a friend that Jack was dead.

&#x200B;

Brad told me about the aftermath of Jack’s death… He remembered it all so clearly. He told me about how the police had spoken with him afterwards. About how they’d initially started looking into it as if it were a murder before eventually deciding that he’d taken his own life. He said that had never sat right with him or some of their other friends… But they’d never gotten the chance to question it much. He told me about how he’d been at the funeral and how he’d even been a pallbearer. 

&#x200B;

Looking in his eyes, I knew without a doubt that Brad wasn’t making a single word of this up. Earlier, I had wondered if this was just his idea of a sick joke… But I knew that no one would go this far for a joke like that. That said, I still found it hard to believe… Like I said before, I’d seen Jack with my own two eyes a few months prior and he sure as hell hadn’t been dead! When I said as much to Brad, he’d just shook his head, unsure what to tell me. 

&#x200B;

After Brad and I parted ways that night, I started looking for Jack again although I never found anything on him aside from an obituary from a few years ago. There was no trace of the man I’d met a few months back. No evidence that he’d even existed… Well… Save for one thing.

&#x200B;

I heard that a few months back, they found a girl buried in a shallow grave out behind a motel, not too far from where I live. I only saw her picture in the newspaper but I still would’ve recognized her anywhere. She was one of the bartenders at a bar I used to hit up every now and again. I hadn’t seen her in a while, in fact… The last time I’d seen her was the night I’d met up with Jack. She’d been the one he’d spent the night flirting with.

&#x200B;

They managed to get some footage of the guy they thought might’ve done it from the motel's security camera and they posted that in the newspaper too. The guy they posted looks almost exactly like the man I met for drinks that night. [The man that I thought was Jack.](https://www.reddit.com/r/HeadOfSpectre/)

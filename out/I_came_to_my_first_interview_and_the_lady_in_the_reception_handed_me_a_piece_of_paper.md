I know everyone would just tell me to think twice about this job simply from the first interview I went to. I walked into this building and greeted the lady at the front desk, she shushed me and pass me a note:

&#x200B;

1. Don’t make a sound until you get in the elevator.

2. If you hear liquids dropping behind you, ignore them.

3. Take the elevator to the 3rd floor.

4. We don’t have the 4th floor

5. If you see the 4th-floor button in the elevator. Get out and wait until the next elevator comes.

6. The manager will tell you the rest.



Okay. What is this? My first thought came to my mind but I didn’t bother asking the lady since she was already in an isolated status with a vibe that pushed me away. I know she would just ignore me if I say anything. And the first rule on the note kind of made me nervous. Ever since I entered this building it surely feels like something invisible is lurking in the corner. I don’t even dare to breathe too loud somehow.

   

“Why the fuck do you even think about taking that elevator?” you must be asking this. Well, they did offer traveling expenses for interviewers. And the salary for this position is really good. I’m able to take a round trip to Europe with half a month of my wage. Provided that they didn’t lie about the salary. Anyway, out of curiosity I still stepped into the lift. the second I’m in I started to scan the interior. Thank God there’s no 4th floor. The elevator was rather quiet and smooth as if it was not moving. I got to the 3rd floor and stepped out of the elevator. It’s just a narrow hallway with one door at the end of the other side. The design is very bright and well-lit. Some motivational slogans are engraved on the two sides of the wall. That bullshit you heard a million times like “To see is to believe”, “Easy come easy go” and “Do not look back”. Okay, maybe the last one is kind of creepy.

&#x200B;

I talked to the manager on the phone, who sounded to be kind but serious. He explained the basic benefits and salary on the phone. Oh, I forgot to say that this is a simple paperwork job. I need to assist in document sorting and reviewing. Generally speaking, the manager said that the detailed working responsibilities would be illustrated further during the interview

As I was standing by the door I was pondering what was inside. Is this a scam? Will I get kidnapped? With the thought in my mind, I still knocked on the door three times rapidly, as my heart is racing I tend to act hurriedly. Each knocking sound is like it comes from a different texture. First is a wooden sound, then a glass sound, and finally the sound of punching a pillow. Before I had time to react to the strange phenomenon, the door opened.

The door pushed itself open slowly to allow me to fully see the scene behind it. A scent of premium wooden lunges at me. I couldn’t help noticing a fake head of an animal decoration hung on the wall. I don’t know what animal it is, looked like a deer but it has fangs and cat-like eyes. A mattress of unknown material covered the floor in the color grey. There’s a round table in the middle of an extremely luxurious office. A man, who I suppose is the manager, sitting there face-to-face with me. He‘s an unnaturally good-looking man. I’m saying this for that he doesn’t look like any handsome celebrity I know. Since beauty has a typical pattern, usually someone who is good-looking you can describe them in comparisons with other actors like Henry Cavil or Tom Cruise. No, I’m just looking at his visage and it sends me a signal to convince me this is a good-looking face that I physically cannot describe what it looks like.

“Welcome. Please take a seat.” his voice is identical to what I heard on the phone. I trotted to sit directly opposite him. As I sat down he beat me to start his introduction before the small talk I prepared to shoot such as” Wow that head decoration is cool.” or “Your receptionist wasn’t the politest I’ve ever met”. “We are a multinational company providing professional services to clients of various fields” he stated with a “smiling” expression I received. “Your salary of a year will be paid upfront in cash if you decided to take this job. You will be responsible for examining each application we received and sorting it out. Details you can find in this handbook of tutorials” He handed me a kraft envelope which I didn’t know when did it appear in his hand or was it already there in the beginning. “It’s all in the book. Take your time to decide. I’ll leave you to it. If you don’t want to take this job please take the elevator down to the lobby and find the lady at the front desk. She’ll escort you to the exit. Do not take the stairs if the elevator is not responding. Just wait and it’ll arrive.” As I’m fumbling to open the envelope he disappeared with his last word behind me before I could ask my tons of questions.

So I opened the envelope and start to read a small handbook with a crimson cover. As I expected, also a set of rules listed:

&#x200B;

1. We handle applications of accident prevention.



2. You are sitting in an office of yours right now.



3. Each day you will receive 275 applications. No more and no less.



4. You will only be allowed to leave the building once your daily job is completed.



5. Applications are sorted by color. Red, Green, and Purple



6. Mark the Red ones in a circle, Green ones in a triangle, and burn the Purple ones using matches in the drawer.



7. If they scream while burning, do not panic.



8. If you find an application in Blue, ignore it. That is not included in your daily amount of 275 workloads.



9. When you find 3 or more blue applications, leave the building as soon as possible regardless of how many unfinished applications are left. The receptionist will help you. Her name is Laura. Remember this.



10. When you find Laura, ask her who is she. Only follow her when she says she is Laura.



11. If she said anything else or offered a different method. Politely declined and turn away. Don’t interact with them anymore.



12. When you successfully leave the building under the above scenario, you’ll be given a 7-days leave.



13. Salary is paid in cash annually on the first day of each year.



I tried not to run away and force myself to read through all the rules. I think now I have no choice but to take this job. Or how should I know if I can find “Laura” safely?

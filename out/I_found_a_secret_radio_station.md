No one uses radio anymore, let's face it. We still listen to one or two stations for car ride music, but that's it. No one gets their news or entertainment from radio shows. 

That's exactly what I was thinking when I got a portable radio last Christmas, but of course I was too nice to say it. "Thank you so much," I said slowly, trying to think of something to add. "You know I like music."

Strangely enough, that radio was all I had for entertainment when my internet went out last weekend. I don't know why I kept the radio that long, really.

I turned the dial lazily. I was bored out of my mind, laying on my bed and holding the radio above me with my arms extended. There were hardly any stations even broadcasting. Staticky country music, boring. Christian music, I got enough of that every Sunday. Boring. Basketball game, not interested. When I turned it again, a little past 70 I believe, I heard a noise so jarring that I rolled over and set the radio down. It was followed by a little jingle, a section from some old waltz song. The static distorting the song and the out-of-tune piano sound put a feeling of discomfort somewhere in me, but I couldn't exactly place where-- or why. It was creepy, in an innocent but menacing way, like a music box in a horror movie trailer. I didn't like it, but I was too curious to turn the radio off. 

The jingle was followed by a few seconds of dull noise, just cracking static. Then there was a voice.

It was a female voice reading a list of numbers and random words, interrupted every so often by a bell tone. Her voice spoke plainly and monotonously, but something in it sounded condescending, conspiratorial, and vaguely mocking, like she was smiling while she spoke but had no real emotion. The whole thing freaked me out. 

The next day, I heard the same thing at the same time. Noise, song, same voice reading off numbers and nonsense words. It repeated for a week. 

The jarring noise woke me up last night. It never happened at night, only 3:07 pm every day. The voice came right after the noise this time, no song. She sounded different. Distressed. I heard a shuffling of papers. "Tw- two. Five. Sailboat. S- seven. Conifer. I- oh god. I hope they aren't listening."

She took a breath. I pulled out my phone and started recording, incase I needed to reference the audio later. I did end up listening to it, several times in fact, but nothing is clearer for me. I referenced it to write this too, to make sure I got everything right that she said. 

"Okay." Ding! "Twenty left. Okay. Listen, if there's anyone listen to me, please-" ding! "Who am I kidding. No one will be listening to this. Ah- if there is anyone listening, I-" ding! "S***. Remember this. Uh, alpha. Twenty-two. Not that. Remember this: a bird in the basket is worth three hundred twelve in the oak. Show me." Ding! "Please. I don't want to do this anymore. I don't want to work for these people, I don't- I don't want to be here. I- I know what's going on." Ding! "Please. Please. Pl-" 

The broadcast ended. From then on, the station was just white noise. At the time of the usual broadcast, the noise went off and the song played, but there was no voice of bel tones, just silence. I turned the dial once and turned it back, and the station was replaced by loud crackling. I haven't heard anything else from it since. 

Please guys, I don't know what's going on. I want to help that girl with whatever is going on, but I don't even know if it's real, or if it is, where to start.

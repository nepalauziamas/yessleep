I've built my computer around 5 years ago. My wife has always told me to buy another one. Since the one that I've built was made of old scrap parts, you could imagine how slow and janky it is, but ive always refused. My computer was built from scratch with my own hands, and if it works, I'll keep it. It was never really a big deal with me until about last month.

My computer's been alot slower than usual. Random files appearing out of nowhere in folders that you'd only be able to find if you search it up in the start menu. Eventually, these files have taken up all of my hard drive space. I figured a virus was behind this, so I decided to execute a deep scan. No viruses. I've downloaded a 3rd party antivirus software, one of the bests. No viruses.

&#x200B;

I was confused. I decided to take matters into my own hands, and remove them manually. I went into each individual folder, searching for never-before-seen files, and deleting them. After about 5 hours, I've managed to delete most of them.

&#x200B;

I stumbled upon an odd video. I've never seen it before. I decided to open it up. There I saw, me with my beautiful wife and my 5 month old daughter. It was a 5 second clip of my wife kissing my daughter's cheek, with me kissing the other. Something was wrong. I've never taken this video before.

&#x200B;

I exited the window, and looked at the video's properties. The video was taken on the 15th of July, 1989. The day I was born. I was dumb-founded. I thought maybe it was an error, or a bug. I refreshed the window, confused. Why was the video taken on my exact birth date? HOW was the video taken on my exact birth date?

&#x200B;

I was searching for hours. After finding nothing, and no reason for this to happen, I decide to watch the video again closely. It looked completely normal to me. I watch the video, again and again, trying to find any abnormalities.

&#x200B;

I noticed something odd. Every time I watched the video again, my daughter look different. Her hair would slowly wither. Turning greyer and greyer every single time I watched it. I watch it again.

I notice something else, even more horrifying. My wife's face. Blood was leaking out of her pores, like she'd been a victim of radiation poisoning. And me. I was devouring my own daughter. I was mortified. "WHAT THE FUCK? WHAT SICK FUCK WOULD DO THIS?" I shout. I immediately exit the window and delete the video.

&#x200B;

I decide to call it a day and shut my pc off. The next day I decide to continue deleting these mystery files. I boot up my pc to see... Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Nothing but that eye numbing, bright blue default windows wallpaper. Nothing on my desktop. A clean slate. My drive has been wiped.

The only file in my computer is that dreaded video. That absolutely nauseating, repulsive video. I delete it. It appears again. I delete it, there it is again. I try to delete it, using dozens of methods, Even downloading a third party app to delete it.

&#x200B;

I think you could already guess what happened next. Out of frustration, I reboot my computer, trying to execute drive recovery. Once it's rebooted, I was relieved to find my desktop wallpaper on my screen, but then, it quickly flashes to THAT image.

The image that's been stuck in my mind for the past 2 days, My daughter's dismembered body, with me devouring her already half eaten kidney. My app's icons, all of my files, every single icon on my pc. That was the only thing I could see. I quickly shut down my computer again, unplug all of my cables, and toss the computer out my window. I collapse onto the ground, crying.

&#x200B;

I couldn't escape It. Everywhere I went, there was a constant reminder of what I did. I did that to my own daughter. I was that sick fuck. I am disgusting. Tomorrow I'm going to kill myself. God won't let me escape from my crime.

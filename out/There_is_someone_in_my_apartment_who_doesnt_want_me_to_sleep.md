The other night I was helping out a friend with cleansing her apartment, we are what Ya'll call witches you see.

While cleansing the apartment I felt myself sucking out all the negativity from the apartment and suddenly everyone except for me relaxed. I was still tense. But I didn't think much of it since everyone else had relaxed. Later that night I went home to go to sleep and had this sudden feeling that someone was watching my every step. 

*Probably just a dumb feeling*, I thought to myself as I closed the blinds, turned off the lights and went to bed. Weird thing though. There was already someone, or something, in my bed. 

I closed my eyes, thinking the feeling would just go away, but it didn't. Instead, I felt a cool breath hit my face, as if someone was hovering right over me, breathing in my face almost an inch away. I tried turning away, but I couldn't move. I was stuck, almost frozen still. 

*Counting!!* I thought to myself. *Counting always works to get rid of an awkward feeling.* So, I began counting.  *One... Two... three...*  Deep breaths. *Twelve... thirteen...*

The bed dipped and I heard footsteps move from my bed to the window. The window slammed open, and suddenly it was quiet. I knew that I was alone again. My eyes cracked open, and I turned my head towards the window. They were closed. Not even disturbed or cracked. They were just how I left them. 

After a lot of tossing and turning, I finally met sleep, with an uneasy feeling in my chest. 

The morning after that, all was forgotten, until it was night again and I got ready for bed.

*I wonder if it will happen again...* I kept thinking to myself. Shaking it off as a weird dream, I got to bed and looked at the clock. *00:00 am, nice, I can get a lot of sleep before work in the morning.* All too soon, sleep fell over me. No worries in my head at all, Until...

*I just woke up, why did I wake up? It's not morning yet, is it?* I thought to myself, trying to turn my head to look at the clock on my phone. I couldn't move. I tried turning over again. Nope, still stuck. 

I opened my mouth to curse out loud, but no sound came out. Convinced that I was still sleeping, I checked around my room one final time before moving to sleep again. That's when I saw it. Something, someone, standing at the edge of my bed. Looking at me. I couldn't see their face, only the outline of their body. 

Still convinced that I was still dreaming, I didn't react too much, until it thundered, and I could see their face. As soon as the thunder and lightning came, it was gone. And with it, the woman. The woman who I now could recognize as the one who I cleansed out of my friend's apartment.

Scared shitless, I tried to forget about it. Once again trying to move in my bed. Once again realizing that I'm still stuck. 

It thundered again and the lightning lit up the room. The woman was closer now before she vanished with the light. 

*Shit, shit, shit. It's just a dream. It's just a FUCKING DREAM.* Reminding myself to be calm, I began trying to move my fingers at least.

More thunder, more lightning. She was even closer now.

My fingers began moving, slowly, as if they'd just woken up.

More thunder, more lightning. She was standing right next to my bed. Right next to my head. I fell still, afraid that my breaths would make her angry. Her skin was frail, almost as if she'd been dead for years and just now rising from her grave. Her smile crooked. She was wearing a black, torn and dirty dress. Her black hair was in clumps, and her eyes black and empty. But then she was gone again.

When the next thundering and lightning came, she was nowhere to be seen. I released the breath I was holding when I realized that I was alone. I still couldn't move more than my hands, Instead I focused on the rain drumming against the windows.

The lightning came again, but now I didn't focus on that. She was back. Flying on top of me. Screaming.

"DON'T GO TOO SLEEP. HE WILL TAKE YOU. DON'T SLEEP"

Panic flooded my veins as she disappeared behind me, and a man took her starting position by the edge of the bed. I began realizing what she said and with all my power tried turning around. Avoiding looking at the man. 

As I succeeded turning my back to the man, I realized I was face to face with the women and squeezed my eyes shut. 

"It's not real. It's not real" The words became a chant as I tried to cool myself down. Unsuccessfully. The womans breathing hit my face, it was cool as ice. Panicked and quick breaths escaped the both of us until I calmed down enough to ask the woman what I needed to know.

"Is he gone?"

Her shaken breaths stopped, and out croaked her broken voice. 

"Yes." Relief flooded me and I felt the bed dip as she moved out of it. I opened my eyes to look at her, and panic flooded me again at the look on her face. She had a wicked smile, almost like a psychopath. 

I opened my mouth to say something but before anything came out, she disappeared and reappeared at the windows. One of the windows opened wide with her standing in the opening.

"But I will be back to finish what he started" The lightning struck, and she jumped out of the window with a scream. No, a wicked laugh. 

It went dark. Darker than before. 

"Hello?" *Dumbass! Don't ask if weirdos are in your house. Just go to sleep.*

The lightning struck again, illuminating the empty room. The windows were closed. Undisturbed. Except for one sentenced written in something red, drippy. *Blood...*

"I'll be back"

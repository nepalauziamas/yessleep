Why are you reading this? Bored? Alone? Wanting to see something… creepy? Scary? Maybe even haunting?

I know why you’re here. I know a lot of things. I could tell you about the unknown. Explain things to you that you’d never understand. That’s the one thing that frightens everyone, isn’t it? The unknown. I could teach you. I could show you. Don’t you want to understand? Everybody wants to understand.

How do I know? How do I understand these things? I’ve seen them. I’ve heard them. I’ve known them. I live in the unknown. It’s dark and cold. I see things I have yet to unsee. It’s the same world you live in, but empty. Except for the chair. There’s a chair in the corner of the room. It rocks and creaks. When it creaks three times, I know it’s time for another explanation.

Are you afraid? No? You should be. Why? I told you, I see the unknown. I am the unknown. The chair will creak soon. And when it does my explanations aren’t so kind. You won’t see me coming. You won’t hear me come in. You won’t sense me standing next to you. You won’t be able to hide. You won’t be able to run. All you’ll be able to do is wish you hadn’t clicked on this story. But it’s not just a story. This is your warning.

Brave. You’re still here. You didn’t like my warning? You crave the unknown. Don’t you? The chair has creaked once already. It’s time. Two. I sense the time is near. Three. You’re warning is now gone. You can’t escape me. I’ll wait for you in the depths of the unknown. It’s time for your explanation.

Those eyes you feel watching you - are mine. Those chills you feel down your spine - are me. Those footsteps you hear - are mine. That door just opened - can you see me yet? I guess not. You haven’t started to scream. You will. Soon.

You’re still here? I’m impressed almost. I suppose your want some answers? I suppose you want to know who I am. I will tell you what I can. After all, you need to be prepared for when I arrive. I don’t know my name, I don’t know much about myself. I call myself the unknown. It seems to be the only way to describe myself. I live in the shadows, the only thing in sight is a chair.

The one I mentioned. The chair chooses its victims. The chair chose me. The chair creaks three times and it has chosen it’s next victim. The chair creaked just before. The chair chose you. I told you to take my warning. But you did not listen.

I am not evil. I do not intend to hurt. I follow the chair. It pointed to me to you. I warned you.
And now you will accept your fate. The chair creaks and I answer. You are lucky it did not rock. It rocks when it wants something more. More than flesh or bones. I can’t explain anymore. You’ll understand for yourself soon enough. I would love to stay around. But my time is running short. I’m waiting in the dark. Learning. Seeing. Gaining strength. I’m preparing.

Can you see me yet? Am I becoming clear? No? The bravest take the longest to break down. You must be brave. Are you brave? That doesn’t matter anymore. Bravery will only get you so far.

Can you hear me yet? Can you sense me yet? Does your pet stand upright and snarl at me yet? I wonder if you know how close I am. How easy it would be for me to reach out and send a shiver down your spine.

You’ll see me soon. Soon you’ll understand. Soon you’ll know the unknown. Soon you’ll know who I am. Soon you’ll wish you’d taken my warning.

Next time you should take a ‘story’ more seriously. If there is a next time.

See you soon. The Unknown.

Ok so this is my first time ever telling anyone this but I kinda feel a bit off ever since I heard this story. So one night I think it was 2019 my family did a fire in our backyard we ran out of beers so my dad offers to get some more since he didn't drink at all that night. When he left I asked my grandpa if there were some spooky stories he had while he lived in the Philippines and as a 12 year old I thought that would kill some of the quiet that the other adaults couldn't fill.

 When I asked my grandpa made a stone cold face while looking at my aunt, (my dads sister) and suddenly she seemed to remember aswell. My grandfather said "there is one that I saw with my own eyes." my aunt added
 "yes everyone in town was talking about it for years." She said that in tagaloge I thought maybe it was to try not making me scared so responded "What was it?" and my grandfather looked at me and said
 "It was a long time ago in the philipines." MY aunt interrupted saying 
"Yes when your dad was your age when landlined used to be commonly used."
My grandfather added
"We were lucky enough to have 2 of them so i gave one of them to your dad." In some drunken messy tagaloge.

My aunt continued saying
"He used to use that thing every minute when he got home after school, he used to go tito johns house and over hear people talking and making prank phone calls. But then one night when the moon was full and the mist was thick, he was walking back home from your uncles house. He told me that he was on edge and his stomach was giving him pain like it was telling not to continue foward but he still did.

 Eventually he arrived to  the old barn that lived to close to our old house, He heard some creaking like any old barn so he continued further until he stopped at an gas station. No one else was there besides Ka michael who was working there part time but he didn't want to bother him so he continued to walk. But suddenly your dad stopped seeing a pale white lady standing untop of a dead group of people holding what seemed like a fetus that wasn't completely developed. Your dad told us he heard humming like an old nursery rhyme kinda thing" she said.

My grandpa cut off her off saying.
"Aye Your father was so scared that he ran all the way back to the gas station and pissed his pants crying and asked Ka Michael to call the police. The next morning after he stayed at the police station telling them what he saw. And in the morning when we went to pick him up we saw a group of policeman around what seemed like a dead family Two women and 3 boys I think 3 siblings and 2 parents. But the weird part was when the autopsie was finished it was discovered all of them had there eyes removed and stomach spikt open, and that one of the females had there abdomine sliced open and had the fetus removed."
My aunt responded

"Nobody could have guessed what happend to them but I rememeber everyone praying and everyone having crosses outside there house after that. Almost nobody left by them selves for a year after that incident."

Afterward i asked my dad about it a week later but he said it was fake but im unsure if it was. So here my grandpa lived in manila Philippines in the country side, My family lived closed to a rice farm. So if anyone has any information please tell me so I can get my mind of it.

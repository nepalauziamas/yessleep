Update 1: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5wduaf/emergency_alert/

Hello everybody, and sorry for the wait. I know a lot of you have been waiting to hear more about my current situation. I have, however, been reading and responding to some of your comments, and I have some new insight into what may be going on. I still have access to the police radio channel, but I haven't had a good signal from it since my first attempt, and I haven't tried looking at it very much. About an hour ago, however, I did get into it. And I wrote down everything as I heard it.

-" Officer Jones? You there? Over." -"I am, who is this? Over." -"Officer Sloan, sir. Do you have any intel from HQ? Over." -" 'Fraid not. I just got done talking to McClellan and that SOB Kowalski. Any word over on your end? Over." -"Not since the last broadcast, about forty-five minutes ago. Last thing I heard was about the footage of the wreck. Over." -"Yeah. Suspected as much. How are you holding up, Sloan? Over." -"Alright, all things considering. And you, Jones? Over." -"Well enough. I'll tell you though, if 013 doesn't turn up fast...I might just end up like poor ol' Officer Brown--with my brains scattered on the ceiling. Over." -"Rest his soul. Over." (At this point, Jones and Sloan went silent for a good ten seconds at least.) -"Well, I guess I'd better get in touch with Kowalski--I put him in charge of examining the wreck footage. Wish me luck. Over." -"Yessir. Over." (Sloan disconnects and Jones waits a minute to call Kowalski.) -"Kowalski? This is Jones. Over." -"Jones, hey. I'm just starting on that wreck footage. I haven't noticed anything out of the ordinary yet, but...Time will tell. Over." -"Right. Look, Kowalski, I need you to focus. This is one of the weirdest parts of the whole ordeal. Think about it. A cop crashes into a telephone pole in a deserted road in broad daylight? Over." -"With all do respect, it might have been an honest mistake. I mean...Come on, it's pretty dark out, what with the disturbances we were trying to prevent 013 from releasing. Over." -"Look, we all know 013 is an anomaly. That's nothing new. But I'm telling you, either he found her and she got the upper hand...or...Let's just say I'm not ruling out suicide. Over." -"Whatever. Hey, let me get back to--" (The signal cut out.)

Also worth noting: the emergency broadcast I received has now been updated to say that emergency services have been suspended indefinitely and leaving one's house is punishable by law. Also, I toom a look of the format of the broadcast and the interface of it. It isn't one I've recognized before, but in my confused state I had been unable to tell. Weird, but what hasn't been lately?

I've been doing alright as of late, but I'm still paranoid at every sound I hear. As I started writing this, the wind picked up, and I can hear rain hitting the roof, getting harder by the minute. Looks like that weather warning wasn't entirely bullshit, huh?

So, I took my dogs up to the shower to do their business, as one of you suggested--I'll edit this after publishing it with his/her username. I haven't gone upstairs yet, but I have nothing else to report, and I don't want to give you a half-assed update, so I'm going to go take a gander out the window and document what I see as I see it.

I just went upstairs. I think I'll take the box of Samoas down with me when a go back down. Hell, I'll take the Samoas AND the Thin Mints. Desperate times call for desperate measures. As you maybe can tell, humor is how I deal with stress. Unhealthy, I know, but whatever. It is what it is.

I just went to the window. I don't see anything, but the neighbor's window is still very broken. The street is very dark and all the lights are very off. Now it's raining, though--the streets are overflowing with water, almost, and---there, the first flash of lightning. Thunder came immediately. The storm's right over us. Right over our little town. The girl doesn't seem to be outside anymore, but I'll be keeping my eyes open. Weird, after that first lightning strike, the sky's lighting up every few seconds. Like I said, nobody around here, including me, is very informed on severe weather, seeing as it never comes our way, but I'm pretty sure that isn't common.

Okay, I just--what the fuck? Okay, the neighbor's door just opened. The one with the broken window. Nobody's there, though. Must've been the wind. I hope he noticed. Come to think of it, maybe I should give him a call and see how he's doing. We used to talk sometimes, after all. It would be nice to hear from someone going through the same shit.

Wait.

I can see him. He's lying on the floor. Oh shit, the girl just came through the door. I ducked (haha, I changed it but autocorrect said fucked) under the window. I don't think she saw me. I'm going to peek out the window just to check.

No, okay, she's walking down the street now. She just passed my house. I don't know why she'd willingly go outside in weather like this. In a scenario like this. But whatever. I'm going back into the basement.

I called my brother earlier. He hasn't gone upstairs in a while. Good thing, too. He said he heard a crash from one of his neighbors' houses a little while earlier, but nothing too loud. Nothing loud enough to cause serious concern.

Weird, as I'm writing, my dogs look worried. Haha, without them I'd have lost my mind by now. Without you guys, too--it's nice having people to talk to in a time like this. Hmm, maybe they have to go do their business again. It's risky though, seeing as my bathroom is upstairs. I'm going to take them upstairs, but I'll take my phone with me.

We just entered the bathroom. Nothing out of the ordinary. Okay, they're done. We're going back downstairs. I'm going to duck past the window, though. Come to think of it, I should really invest in some blinds for that window.

FUCK.

I just went into the basement, but as I passed the window, I saw her pass it too on the other side. I don't think she saw me, but holy fuck. Why is she out there wandering like this? By now it's crossed my mind multiple times that she is "013." And from this close...that pillowcase looks a bit more hospital gown-esque. Shit, guys. I'd phone the cops, but I don't even know their number. I need to go. I'll update you guys soon. Until then, assume I'm alive.

UPDATE: Okay, guys, so by now I've figured out that 911 takes you to the police, buuuuuut I also remembered that bit about emergency services being suspended. So there's that.

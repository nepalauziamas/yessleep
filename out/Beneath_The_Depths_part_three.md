My grandfather shared with me, a story about his time as a limnologist. He was contracted to a small research team attempting to discover the mystery behind a small, unassuming pond and the individuals that went missing within.

It didn’t take long for the company contracting the researchers to put everyone in a state of unease as their tactics for getting results went from questionable, to excessive.

During my grandfathers investigation and multiple tests, he began to notice a strange pattern within the pond. Before he could make any real progress, a scientist was held at gunpoint and forced into the pond.

Things only began to amp up further as the men in charge began making preparations search the ponds depths. Unfortunately, they did not return alive.

It didn’t take long for panic to ensue amongst the group left as the remaining men in charge attempted to reassure everyone’s safety. This did little quell the animosity and terror. Eventually, one of the men in yellow removed a handgun from his jumpsuit and placed it to the ichthyologist’s cheek. He threatened to kill the man if the research team didn’t settle down.

Once the crowd had settled, he began demanding answers from the ichthyologist.

Quivering and begging for his life, the scientist attempted to explain what had happened. 

The team wasted no time exploring the depths of the pond, as they scoured for any sign of the foreign scientist they left for dead, they came across a point near the center of the pond, where the water temperature began increasing. Eventually, they discovered a small crevice leading further down, below the pond. It was too small for a normal man to fit through and though they attempted to widen the hole, they failed to do so.

As the team started to make its way to the surface for tools, their leader approached to find the hole wide enough to fit his arm inside. He began feeling around for weak spots in its structure to pull apart, as it seemed the crevice became slightly wider. The scientist watched on as the leader felt around inside. He panicked momentarily as the leader flinched and quickly removed his arm. A thick stream of blood flowed from the leaders finger as he shook off the pain and switched arms.

By this point, it seemed as though the crevice had become a solid hole, big enough for the men to swim down safely. Their leader went first. One by one, the men slipped into the tightly packed hole, the ichthyologist left behind to watch. He approached the hole, scanning for abnormalities as he started to feel the mouth of the hole shift slightly. He glanced over at the one of the sharp edges inside the mouth of the hole, still grasping part of the leaders wet suit. The jagged shape of the object suddenly became familiar. Frantically, he began scanning the hole, noticing a pattern of jagged edges. 

Through his mask, he began screaming as he did his best to get the mens attention. The man nearest him looked back to see him in a panic. He continued screaming, but they couldn’t understand. Noticing the scientists distress, he began angling himself to turn around to go back. As the back of his head brushed another sharp object protruding from the mouth of the hole, he felt the back of his head as more blood flowed to the surface.

It was at that moment, the man started to realize what was surrounding him, as the gargled shouts from the scientist became clear…. “Teeth”

The man panicked and tried helplessly to turn around as the sharp teeth surrounding the hole began to extend through the rough exterior, but he became stuck as the hole began closing around him. The rest of his team, now noticing their circumstances, attempt to push past him, as his body begins pressing against the sharp teeth. Terror and agony pours over his face as his team force his body into the sharp teeth in attempts to escape, his body being violently torn apart as men below, push desperately against him in attempts to escape their fate. The scientist begins backing away in retreat as he watches the man’s body tear in half, with little time or space for the rest of the team to crawl out from the mouth.

Small chunks of the man’s body begin floating to the surface and the last few remaining bubbles escape the mens watery grave as the mouth closes around them and a small cloud of blood escapes before the hole becomes sealed once more.

After the scientist had finished his story, the man once holding him hostage, had let him free. The man dropped his arms to his side, gun still between his fingers. The scientist, still on the ground, crawled a short distance away and stopped. Everyone waited and watched as the man’s face flushed pale.

He lifted the gun once more towards the scientist.

The scientist let out a brief scream as the muzzle flashed and my grandfather turned away. 

He glanced back to find the scientists brain littering the trees and grass around him. 

Panic ensued once more as the man calmly began shedding his jumpsuit for a wetsuit. In the frenzy, my grandfather made his escape into the forest, as more gunfire went off behind him. He looked back momentarily to see the man wading into the depths of the pond, gun still in hand.

My grandfather eventually made his way to a road and hitchhiked into town. From there, he caught a bus back to his house. Afraid for my grandmothers life, he decided to keep it to himself until he was sure it was safe.

He waited several days inside his home, waiting for men in yellow to come and collect him, but they never showed. He was eventually contacted by his company to inquire about the research project. My grandfather decided not share the events of that day. Instead, he decided to tell them he never went.

Months later, his boss approached him about news involving the research project. According to him, the project was funded my a shell corporation. My grandfather stopped him there… he wanted to hear no more.

My grandfather was always a trustworthy man and not prone to exaggeration. Though this story was hard to believe, it always stuck with me and ever since then, I’ve been researching. I’ve decided that I want to find this pond. I want to better understand what they discovered that day. So many questions left unanswered. A few months back, it was reported that an elderly man, ranting and raving about his lost sister, disappeared into some woods near a small body of water, never to be seen again. I think I found it.

Wish me luck…

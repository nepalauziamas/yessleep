Like any normal day, I finished work at 8 pm and packed my things and left my workplace.


From the building where I work, there is a wide alley from which you can walk to my house. Like most times, I walked down this alley because I still hadn't taken my car and I had decided that I would walk tonight.


As I walked down the alley in the distance next to a street lamp I saw a strange shadowy figure standing under a street lamp.  The closer I got to it, it seemed to fade more and more.  The figure was now about 20 meters away from me and suddenly turned and made direct eye contact with me and what happened was just not only confusing but mind blowing.  


The light from the lamp seemed to fade more and more and by the time i reached the figure it was completely gone.  When I passed the lamp, 10-15 meters after I passed it I heard the loudest sound of breaking a lamp I have ever heard.  The lamp had shattered, and no trace of it remained on the street iron post where it sat.  After so many strange things, I suddenly became seriously worried and started walking faster and faster. 


I was about 50 meters from my house when I heard something behind me that just blew me away, "John, what are you in such a hurry for, I'm not going to hurt you."  My legs started shaking like never before and when I turned around it was there, 15 meters away from me. I didn't hesitate at all and ran out of there.  I was 5 meters from my home and started looking for my keys in the backpack I was carrying.


But then came another shock.  I heard this thing running after me.  Thank goodness I didn't even turn around because I had already found my keys.


I unlocked the door and slammed it with all my might.  I looked through the peephole, but there was nothing there anymore.  Calmed down, I went in to take a shower.


When I got out of the bathroom I got ready for bed and suddenly fell asleep.  Around 3:30 in the morning I woke up to a strange sound coming from somewhere in my room and got up to check what was going on.


Some knocking sound was heard again from downstairs of my house and I came out of my room to check what was going on.  I headed for the stairs and started down them.  After each next step, for inexplicable reasons, my heart seemed to stop.  A frantic fear gripped me with each subsequent step.


I went down to the first floor and the sound came from the kitchen again.  I went to check and when I turned on the light there was nothing except that my fridge door was slightly ajar.  I closed it when the sound was heard again.  It came from the living room.


I headed there and when I opened the door and turned on the light it was as if something was different in the room.  And suddenly I noticed what.  Certain things were moved around like my magazines were put where my figurines were and the figurines were put in place of the magazines as well and the rug was moved and pulled further into the room then I was like "What the hell" like right  at that moment the knocking came from the second floor, where my room was.


I went there immediately went into my room, turned on the light, but there was nothing there, except that my sheets were slightly moved, and then I thought that something really strange was going on.  I put out the light and went to bed, and suddenly the knocking sound was closer than ever, and when I turned to see what it was, my heart would stop.


The shadow was standing right next to my bed and said, "John, I told you not to run away from me because I'm always one step ahead of you, I'll always catch you."  I woke up suddenly when I heard the same knocking sound coming from downstairs.

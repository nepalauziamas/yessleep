I recently moved into a new apartment with my dog, Marbles. It’s not a nice place, by any means, but it’s the only option I had. I’m just starting a new job, and I barely have enough money to cover rent, ramen, dog food, and a Netflix subscription. So, I settled on this small dirt cheap apartment on the outskirts of town, partly because it’s cheap and partly because it’s pet friendly. No, it isn’t ideal, but it’s only temporary while I save up some cash.

The apartment is small, with only three rooms. The first room you enter is the kitchen/living room, with a hall way in the back. The door at the end of the hall leads to the bathroom. In the hallway is a door on the right side to the bedroom. I don’t have any furnishings or personal belongings, so the apartment remained very bare. I never bothered to worry about sprucing the place up because it was just a temporary home.

We had been in the apartment for a few weeks and everything had been fine. As we really settled in to the place, Marbles took a liking to the couch in the living room. It wasn’t my couch, it came with the apartment. Well, Marbles started sleeping on the couch at night. That said, Marbles likes to get up and relocate in the middle of the night. She would get up and come to the bedroom door and hope to get inside. I always sleep with the door closed, so she would start to whine and paw a the door. Marbles had long nails that she hated getting cut, so you could hear her walking throughout the apartment if you were awake, and it made her pawing pretty loud. After a few nights of this, I just started leaving the door open for her. From then on she would come and get in the bed with me at all times of the night. This never bothered me. Many more weeks went by with nothing note worthy happening.

Well, one weekend my Netflix binging session lasted much longer than usual and I was still up at 2:00 in the morning. I was just wrapping up Stranger Things season 2 when out of the corner of my eye, I saw it. In the doorway to the hall, there was something peaking at me. I turned to look directly at it. It looked like the top half of a face, peeking from the left side of the doorway. The only thing I could see were two eyes, beady and black, staring at me. I was frozen, not sure if it was fear or shock stopping me from moving. I blinked. It was still there. 

After a few more seconds, I started panicking and yelled out “Who are you? Get out!” For a few more seconds it kept staring, and then slowly began to pull away and out of view. Once I could no longer see it, it took a few moments to regain control of my body. Once I had, I jumped up and slammed the door, locking it. Marbles, who had been laying on the bed with me, was now sitting up and alert.

I called the police, and told them someone had broken into my apartment. After a while, I heard them knocking on the front door. Eventually, I mustered the courage to step out from the room and run to the front door. They investigated, and the landlord was called. No one was found in the apartment, and when the police had arrived, the front door was still locked from when I got home. There were no signs of breaking and entering, but I insisted that I saw someone. The police did one more sweep of the apartment before leaving, telling me that there was nothing more they could do.

The landlord, to whom I must give credit, swapped out the locks the next day, giving me all new keys. He told me that it was possible a previous tenant still had a set of keys to the room, and had come in. The thought unnerved me, but the more I thought back on it, the less human the thing seemed to be.

It took a few weeks and many sleepless nights to go back to normal, if you could call it that. I told myself that I could handle the stress, that we would only be here a little while longer. During that time I also bought a baseball bat which I now kept beside my bed. Now, I still kept the door to the bedroom open at night, but only slightly ajar so Marbles could slip in or out. I didn’t feel comfortable seeing the doorway where that thing had been.

One night, Marbles came in and hopped up on the bed like she usually does. She settled down and rested her head on my thigh, a common occurrence. I had been asleep, and never bothered to open my eyes. I started drifting back off to sleep when I heard a sound. It was a familiar sound of scratching on the floor. It was Marbles’ nails on the floor as she walked. It came from the living room and was approaching the bedroom door. I was facing the side of the room with the door, and I opened my eyes. Marbles was there, pushing the door open and coming in. A chill ran up my spine.

Slowly, I looked over and down at the bed… it was there. The thing was resting its head on my thigh, looking right into my eyes. For a second I got a look at it, it had a humanoid form, but it was impossibly inhuman. It’s face was horrific, with those beady black eyes, long greasy black hair, and a mouth without lips. It’s body was elongated, and it looked as though it was made up of only bones with skin wrapped tightly around them.

It’s face started to creep closer to mine, and I was finally able to move. I threw the blanket over the thing and jumped out of the bed, running to the front door. I could hear it scurrying behind me, along with Marbles running behind. When I got to the door, I turned to see both Marbles and the thing following. Marbles made it to the door first, and once she was out I slammed the door closed. I heard and felt the thing slam against the door, scratching and banging against it. I could also hear it’s raspy breathing. Eventually it all went quiet.

My phone was still inside, but after a while one of the neighbors opened the door after frantic knocking. They phoned the police for me. The police weren’t as friendly this time, but I told them I trapped the “person” inside my apartment. After a long search of the entire apartment, the police found… nothing. I couldn’t believe it. They scolded me, and told me that if I called for this again I’d be arrested. I felt like I was going insane.

Refusing to go back in alone, the landlord accompanied me while I packed up all my belongings. I wasn’t staying here any longer. My parents had an extra room they offered me, and it was going to take a long time before I felt comfortable being alone again.

I’m typing this all out from my parents house, laying in the guest room. Well, a few paragraphs ago I noticed something. Over in the corner is a closet with folding doors. It’s slightly open, and in the crack of the doors I can see two beady black eyes staring right at me…

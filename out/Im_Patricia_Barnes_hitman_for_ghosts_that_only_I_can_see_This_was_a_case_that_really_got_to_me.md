[I flopped the woman’s dead body unceremoniously onto the ground and lit a cigarette to catch my breath.]( https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/b3q2xl/i_have_an_unusual_job_the_pay_is_good_but_i/) “Well, Cindy,” I muttered through a delightful stream of smoke, “I hope those after-market titties were worth it, because they did *not* make carrying you any easier.”

Cindy (or was it Madison? I don’t keep close track of these things) simply stared out into the cobalt blue sky in silent repose. 

If she’d had anything to say, the dried foam on her lips would have been gurgling by now. 

I plopped myself down on an outdoor chair and took in the surroundings.

Madison’s backyard was a destination unto itself. Dogwood flowers mingled freely with magnolias, and stately oak trees flanked the edges of a yard dotted with willows. I breathed in the moment while the cicadas sang at full force.

“Truly one of the finest yards in Alabama, Madison,” I offered, glancing in contempt at the tongue lolling out of her mouth. “I’ve laid you to rest right next to the beautiful oleanders that I used to poison your tea. Repose en paix.”

I pinched the butt and slipped the cigarette into my pocket to avoid leaving any traceable evidence before forcing my creaking bones out of the chair.

Lifting corpses just leaves my joints exhausted afterwards.

My hips screamed in protest, reminding me that they couldn’t work like the pistons they had been back in the 70s. With effort, I stepped over her body and headed for the gate, wondering just how much she would rot in the Southern sun before the neighbors complained about the smell. 

Monday mornings are really wearing on me more than they once did.

I was staring at a topless man when the dead boy walked into my sun porch. 

And he wasn’t just any topless man. He looked like that Jason Mimosa actor from the underwater movie. My guess is that God had given him a chest at the expense of a brain, because he was walking around in a perpetual daze, clearly unaware that he was dead. He didn’t seem to need any help, so I didn’t intervene.

I was happy just to watch.

“Please miss, I need your help.”

I looked over the edge of my iced tea and stared down at the boy. 

He was a sight. No more than ten years old, but possessing the eyes of a war veteran. Ashen gray skin with livid purple bruises around his neck. 

I took a less-than-respectable gulp from the sweet tea. The topless man had flustered me, and I wanted to cool down enough to at least give the *appearance* of presentability to the child. 

I popped the cigarette back into my mouth. “If you are here to inquire about my professional services, young man, please understand that compensation needs to be arranged before any services are rendered.”

He looked at me with innocent confusion. He was a cute kid, honest to God, and cute kids annoy the bejeezus out of me. Especially dead ones. 

He clearly didn’t understand me, so I went for a more direct approach. “How are you gonna pay me, kid?” I blew a waft of smoke that passed right through his dead face and swirled out the back of his skull.

“I don’t have any money,” he said flatly. “I’m only a kid, and I think I’m dead.”

“Well then we have no business to conduct,” I quipped. I looked up in disappointment to find that the topless ghost had wandered off. I sighed. 

Sophocles leapt into my lap and started purring. I looked down to scratch behind his ear when I noticed the boy still in my field of vision. I narrowed my eyes at him.

“Please, Miss. I hear that you can help people after they die.”

He called me “Miss,” instead of “Ma’am” or “someone’s grandma,” so he was starting to win me over. 

I hate it when people win me over.

I sighed again. “Look, kid. You can’t ask me to compromise my prices when you’re compromising your morals. I’m running a respectable business here. If you want someone killed, you need to give me cash.”

“But…” he looked confused. “…I don’t want anyone killed, Miss. I just want my sister to be alive.” 

I made no attempts to hide my eye roll. “I get this a lot, kid. Sorry, but I can’t make anyone non-dead. No one can.” I quashed my spent cigarette, lit another, and took a deep breath. “What has been done can never be undone.”

He shook his head. “No, that’s not it. My sister’s alive right now.” He quivered, and looked like he was about to cry. “But she might not be for much longer.”

Ah, shit. I was really beginning to soften. “Kid, I’m not a doctor. I can’t help the living any more than they can help themselves.”

He shook his head again in urgency. The purple bruises on his neck gave me the heebie jeebies. “No doctor can save her, because they don’t know where she is. But even doctors won’t be able to make her better if she’s there much longer.”

I slowly lowered the cigarette and looked the kid up and down once more. 

“A man took us while we were walking to school. He locked us in his basement. I tried to make Anna feel better, because I’m three years older, but I was crying, too.” He wiped his eye, and I was determined not to show that I had the same need. “I promised that I would find a way out of the basement for her, and I looked real hard. We weren’t there but a day when the man came downstairs again and got awful mad. I tried to protect Anna, but then I realized it was me he was after. I fought back as hard as I could, but he was super strong.” He wiped his eye again. “He strangled me and it hurt real bad, more than I thought a body could hurt, and I realized that he was going to make Anna suffer the same way, and then it felt like I was floating.” He stopped talking and struggled to compose himself. “Anna couldn’t see or hear me after that, no matter how much I tried to talk to her. Then I realized I could walk right through the door.”

He stepped closer and gave me these terrible doe-like eyes that made me want to smack him and then have a good cry.

“I saw where he keeps his keys. I’m the only one who knows where Anna is, and you’re the only one who can help me. I’m sorry I don’t have any money, but will you help us?”

I sighed.

This is why I hate kids.

It was pitch black outside as I helped Sophocles into the pet door of the kidnapper’s house.

“How will your cat know to bring the keys back to you?” the boy asked in wide-eyed wonder.

I cackled quietly. “You think Sophocles is just a cat?”

He responded with a shocked silence that lasted until the black feline shadow popped back out the pet door, dropped the keys from his mouth into my hands, and purred loudly. 

“Thank God we can get through the door,” I muttered, looking up at the ivy-covered trellis. “It’s been many years since I’ve been confident in my prowess at negotiating second-floor windows. Though you’d be surprised what a body can do when motivated by the promises of a conjugal visit.”

“What?” the boy asked innocently.

“I said that you should always eat your vegetables. Now what makes you so sure that this man isn’t at home right now?”

The boy fidgeted. “I… I lied. He might be in there. I didn’t think you’d come rescue my sister if it were too dangerous.” 

One of the worst things about dead people is that you can’t smack them. Everyone knows someone who needs a good smack, and that need is only compounded by the fact that societal expectations preclude us from delivering a much-needed antidote to the slap-deprived.

I sighed and rubbed my temples. “Okay. I’m armed with a cigarette lighter and a cat against a violent criminal. Great plan, kid.”

He looked at me like he was going to cry. 

Again.

So that’s how I found myself sneaking through the man’s creepy house. 

It certainly *looked* like the lair of a child kidnapper. Every light was out, and of course I didn’t risk turning any on. The kitchen was alive with the buzzing of unseen flies, which were no doubt feasting on whatever unholy concoction of decomposing foodstuffs was currently assaulting my nose. If the smell was any indication, the man was an aficionado of marinated toe jam, cat food, and aged cream.

I crept through the darkened kitchen and into the silent living room. The raw emptiness of that space was somehow worse; the house felt devoid of *humanity,* as though no happy person had ever touched these walls.

The fact that I was being guided by a ghost did not comfort me in any way.

Nor did the knowledge that the criminal who resided here might show up at any second.

Nevertheless, I clawed my way along the floor of the disgusting man’s abode in search of the basement door. My hand found cool metal, and I smiled grimly. 

I flicked the cigarette lighter just long enough to fit the key into the door. It opened with a satisfying *click.* 

The rough-hewn steps told me that this basement was an amateur addition to the house, likely designed to keep prying eyes away from unsavory secrets.

I blew out the lighter and descended into darkness. 

I could feel the temperature drop significantly with every step.

I'd expected a full staircase of around 19 steps, but was off by about 13. I came to rest on a dirt floor that was far too close to the ceiling. Claustrophobia crept around the edges of my brain. 

*“Keep going,”* came the voice of the ghost behind me. 

I moved forward, my head and neck brushing up against the ceiling.

The air was thick and musty.

“Stop.”

My breath hitched.

“Can you find her and tell me if she’s alive?” he whispered through tears. 

I didn’t want to be in this creepy man’s house. I didn’t want to be in the basement of said house. And I *really* didn’t want to wave my arms around in the dark to search for a corpse.

A cigarette, though. *That* would have hit the spot.

I was just thinking about how nice that would be when I felt the girl’s arm.

My body temperature dropped as every hair on my neck rose.

“Dammit girl, wake up!” I spat in a raspy whisper. “Move, now, you hear?”

I jumped as the boy spoke. “We had found a flashlight on the floor before I died.”

My mind raced. I had tried to remain discreet as possible, but light *was* going to be a necessity if I had to haul this girl out of here. I reached around on the floor, found the flashlight, and clicked it on. 

I fell on my ass as the beam illuminated a face. 

The girl was staring, unblinking, right at me. I forgot to breathe.

She didn’t look good.

I gasped, then controlled my breathing. “Hey, kid,” I offered tentatively as I crept toward her. “Wake up. We’d best be leaving *right now.*” 

My words reverberated oddly in the dilapidated basement.

I touched her shoulder and shook it.

The girl’s skin yielded disgustingly to my touch, but her body was grotesquely stiff. 

The movement caused a brief unnatural escape of gasses through her open mouth.

Her eyes were like glass.

Mine were wet.

“No, no, no, kid,” I whispered, moving closer while the flashlight’s beam bounced erratically about the room. “Don’t do this, please, don’t.”

“I found Anna,” the boy said from behind me, causing me to jump. 

I turned around to see him standing at the top of the stairs.

“She’s like me now,” he explained. “You were too late.”

I stopped hiding my tears. “I’m… I’m sorry, kid.” I heaved a shuttering gasp. “Let me talk to her. Where is she?”

The boy didn’t move. 

He seemed very old.

“You didn’t save her,” he explained simply. “Why?”

I searched for words and found none. “Please,” I gasped. “Let me speak with her.” I looked wildly around for answers that I couldn’t find. I briefly noticed the door to what looked like an underground bomb shelter, which was creepy enough in its own right, but I didn’t have time to process what I was seeing. 

He didn’t move. “You weren’t there for her,” he continued in his matter-of-fact way. “So she doesn’t ever want to see you again.”

I sobbed. “I’m sorry. I’m sorry for everything, William.” 

“Who’s William?” he asked innocently.

I wiped my eyes. “I didn’t mean to say that. But please, tell your sister that I want to talk with her, to make things all right.”

He sighed, and it was so much heavier than a child’s sigh should ever be. “No, it won’t. The man hurt her so much worse than he hurt me, and things will never be all right. Anna said she wanted to grow up and be a veterinarian to help all the sick animals, not get cold in the ground while the world slowly forgets she ever lived.”

Part of me broke then. I was surprised; by that time in my life, I had figured all the tiny pieces that were left of me had been too small for cracking. But I suppose the world isn’t above grinding even the tiniest pieces into the finest of dust.

I looked up again to see that he had climbed to the top of the stairs. He was barely visible in my flashlight. 

Then a tiny girl’s arm reached from beyond the door, and took his hand in hers. She pulled him away, and he disappeared.

I remember that he was smiling. 

That’s the sort of thing that stands out when you see someone for the very last time.

A warm, furry force suddenly pushed against me in the darkness. I reached out and scratched Sophocles behind the ears.

I dried my eyes again. “You’re right, it’s time to stand up,” I sniffed.

I got achingly to my feet and took a deep breath.

“Because I’m not done here. Somewhere in this house is a man who deserves something far more sinister than poisonous oleander in [his tea](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/).”

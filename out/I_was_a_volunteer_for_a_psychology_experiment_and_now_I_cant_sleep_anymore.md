I fall asleep easily. I mean, like a stone. If I put my head on a pillow my day's over, I'm gone for the next 8 hours. Why can't I sleep anymore. Why can't I sleep.

*Finally.*

A few days ago I volunteered for a psychology experiment. It's the only thing I can think of to explain why I can't sleep anymore. I really tried everything. The first sleepless night I had, I thought maybe I had too much caffeine. I looked up ways to fall asleep online. I drank some tea, turned all the lights off, put on some white noise - thunderstorms - and laid in bed.

Waiting.

Waiting.

I got so desperate I counted 87,324 sheep when I realized the sun was almost up.

*Gold, nice.*

The sun was up, so I decided to just try to stay awake until the night. I felt tired, I wanted to, needed to sleep, my brain just didn't shut down. My body didn't allow me to. I started wondering if somehow, something happened when I volunteered. I don't see what could have happened to trigger this though?

I was contacted over the phone for an interview. The lady on the phone - she didn't give me a name - asked me a lot of questions, how old am I, what do I do for a living, and then some sort of personality tests. She asked if people ever told me I look like a movie star, if I think it's wise to reveal my secrets, or if I avoid dangerous situations. Basic personality test questions really. It only lasted about half an hour overall, then she asked if I'd be willing to do some in-person testing.

I'm a pretty curious person, so I was a little excited to find out what kind of a study they were doing. They did tell me the name of it, but I don't really understand what it means, something about "operation conditioning" and "ash co-formation". I entered the testing facility and introduced myself to the secretary. He seemed very busy, clicking away at his computer. I think he was excited about whatever he was doing. I heard an excited "yes" whispered at some point. He took a brief break to apologize and let me know it would be a little longer wait than expected. That didn't bother me too much, he was very nice about it, told me I could help myself to the coffee and donuts the institute had out for volunteers. I did so gladly.

*Yes*

It really was a long wait, I finished my cup of coffee and was starting to contemplate taking a second one - they are free after all. But then the secretary called my name and directed me to a room. I think I heard someone enter the waitin room right after I left it. I was the only one in there, would have been nice to have someone to talk to. The room he took me to had a desk at the center of it, with three colored buttons. Red, green, and blue. He shut the door behind me, leaving me alone in the room. I waited there for a few minutes, alone.

I started wanting to push one of the buttons. I felt a little uneasy about it, since I didn't know what any of them do. I didn't want to break anything. But if these were really so important they wouldn't just leave people in the room with them like that, right? What if they were measuring how long it takes for someone to do something? I don't want to seem too passive and be one of the people who take too long. But...what if I do it too early, and look impulsive? Is this another screening test? If I go too fast or too slow will they not let me continue the tests?

*Gold again, so good*

Sorry, I zone out a little sometimes now. I really am so tired.

Do the colors matter? Maybe I shouldn't pick red. That's aggressive. Blue is too...I don't know. Sad. Green is usually good. Green means go right? I couldn't tell you how long I awkwardly stood there overthinking things. Eventually, I took a step towards the desk and pushed the green button, in the middle.

Nothing happened when I did. Well. That's not entirely true. I \*felt\* something happen. But it was something inside me. I felt good. I loved pushing it. I even pushed it again. Again. Again. It was like pushing pure joy into my body every single time. It was so satisfying. But it didn't activate anything. It didn't seem to be connected to anything or do anything on its own. I kind of wish they did something like put electrodes on my head or hypnotize me instead.

I don't know. I just think that, at least if they did something weird to me my sudden insomnia would at least make sense. "Of course you can't sleep, they zapped your brain!"

But no, nothing weird. After a few minutes a researcher opened the door, told me I could follow her into the next room where she just asked some more interview questions. Not even particularly weird questions. She then told me they would be in contact again soon and walked me to the exit.

I feel like the longer I stay awake the faster my heart starts to race.

*There it is*

They did get in contact with me again the next day, they sent me a link to a chat room with other participants. We've all been playing a silly game. You just send whatever message you want, and sometimes a message unlocks a button to push. Gold buttons are very rare. I just send numbers, all day long. I've earned so many buttons.

I just can't figure out why I can't sleep. At least I have a game to keep me busy.

I've started seeing buttons appear under normal text messages. I don't think they're really there, but I feel good when I push them. Maybe I would feel better if I ate something. It just takes so much time to eat. Time I could spend mining for buttons.

Sometimes I worry that the buttons stopped appearing. I feel cold and weak and start to wonder why I've done this for so many hours. It never lasts too long though. The buttons always show up for me.

I'm really thankful I can't sleep anymore. That gives me so much time to mine for and push the buttons.

The button gives me meaning

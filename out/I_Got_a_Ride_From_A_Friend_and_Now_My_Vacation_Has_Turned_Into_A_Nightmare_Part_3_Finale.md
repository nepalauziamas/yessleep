I sat in that car, I looked at nothing, and I did my best to think of nothing too. The events of the day had drained me and though they were over for now, just like the sun’s light, if they were to continue I doubted I’d make it through the night. My nerves were shot and my mind was broken. I had no safety to retreat to and so I simply sat there. In the span of several hours I’d been reduced from a fully functioning human to a quivering coffin for consciousness. I didn’t know if I could take any more of what Gil had in store for me, but given previous events I doubted I could escape if I’d wanted to. He started talking again then, Gil, the one who held me against my will.

&#x200B;

“You’re looking pretty tired over there! We’ve only visited two people and you’re already ready to turn in? It’s hard to believe you’re like this now. Before you left we were all almost always together, sure one or two of us might drop out for a bit, but our lives were always intertwined as one. You’ve been away too long.”

&#x200B;

“Where is she really Gil? Why did you lie to me?” I spoke in broken tones then. These were the only words I had left. The answers to my questions were all that mattered to me then.

&#x200B;

“She left a long time ago, pal.” He was stating it as a matter of fact then.

&#x200B;

“Why?” I sounded tired in that way that you can’t reach unless you haven’t been under your eyelids for the better part of a week.

&#x200B;

“I think we both know why she left, and why she couldn’t bother to come around when you did. The poor woman couldn’t stand to be around you. You were always creeping her out and I’m honestly surprised that she didn’t leave sooner.” The words were so condescending coming from his mouth.

&#x200B;

What Gil said threw me for a loop. Nothing about it made any sense. Kate and I’d gotten along in a way that I didn’t know people could before we met. Maybe she was creeped out though, just not by me. “It must have been Les. That mouth breather, he must have scared her away.” I said, giving voice to my suspicions.

&#x200B;

“What difference does it make whether it was you or Les that drove her away? You brought him into your dynamic with her and you’re responsible for the outcome of it all.” Gil almost seemed annoyed when he spoke. It was that type of frustration that occurs when you realize that the person you’re talking to has inevitably  failed to keep up with the meaning of your words.

&#x200B;

“That’s bullshit Gil and you know it. How can you hold me responsible for another person's actions?” I was choking back tears.

&#x200B;

Several emotions seemed to flash across Gil’s face then. Surprise, confusion, maybe pain, and then his face settled into a grimace that might occur in response to profound offense. “Asshole!” That was all he said, and I’m still not sure that I understand why.

&#x200B;

We rode then, in silence, for quite some time after. Both of us having managed to draw the ire of the other. It was the flashing light of a neon sign that drew me back into the present and signaled our ride's end for the moment. While Gil pulled up to the curb I took in our surroundings and instantly recognized the bowling alley advertised by the light’s source.

&#x200B;

“Oh.” I muttered.

&#x200B;

“Oh?” Gil shot back, sending my words to return as a question. “Vic might be a loathsome ball of nerves, but I think you could try and be a little more excited to see him than just ‘Oh’. He’s been waiting for you to get back since you left, we all have, and I think he deserves a bit more appreciation than just ‘Oh’.”  Gil was visibly angry, but at this point I was past caring.

&#x200B;

“You’re all assholes and I’m through with this place. Let’s get this over with so I can be done with it all.” I knew that at best my words were testing him, but was indifferent. I think a part of me even hoped he’d put me out of my misery, though I’m sure you’ve deduced from my writing that he didn’t do so. As I’d soon learn, letting go of me in any capacity would never be part of his plans.

&#x200B;

We got out of the car then and made our way across the sidewalk to the door. As we went, the sign above the bowling alley entrance illuminated our path and the red neon light it cast reflected off the running rainwater at our feet. We were only in it for a moment, but the impact of the rain on my head was enough to dispel certain theories I’d had of whether I was alive or not.

&#x200B;

We stepped then, through clear glass doors, out of the night lit streets and into the blinding fluorescence that illuminated the bowling alley. The first thing I remember about the place was its width. It was staggering in scope and the facilities of the place seemed to stretch on indefinitely. Eventually my eyes adjusted so that they could make out the walls which were enclosing us in. Row after row of lanes stood empty, their pins in order, save for two that seemed to be occupied by separate parties. At the first, a group of young people, predominantly men, drank and bowled the night away as they let off steam after what was likely a long day of studying, the second group was a group of one. I recognized the lone figure, the one we’d come here for.

&#x200B;

Did you ever have one of those friends who’d always have your back and never let you get pushed around, but also inevitably made a scene and embarrassed you? That was what it was like to have Vic as a friend. He was always the first among us to speak up when something wasn’t right, but also the first to get kicked out of wherever we’d find ourselves. I hated to admit it, but as far as friends go he was the type you only ever talked to when you had a problem he could fix. He stood there, by the lane, long lanky limbs sinewy with muscle and hidden only under a button up T-shirt over a baggy pair of jogging pants. A vein in the center of his head rose to prominence on the angular features of his face, and as he lined up a shot with the ball in his right hand there was a concentration that I wouldn’t dare to break. I knew how Vic could get when you distracted him and wouldn’t dare to piss him off, but the other group, well they didn’t.

&#x200B;

Vic took a step towards the line of his lane, wound up, and made for a swing. Just as he was about to release his projectile, to claim what likely would have been a strike, someone in the other group erupted in rapturous laughter. I watched Vic grow tense, his concentration broke, and he fumbled the shot. It was a gutterball. A lump began to form in my throat as I watched his gaze turn from the failed shot to the people he would inevitably blame for it. He began to step towards them.

&#x200B;

“Shut The Fuck up!” Vic screamed at the students. They all immediately ceased what they were doing and turned to look at him.

&#x200B;

“What the heck man? Nobody’s trying to bother you. Just chill out and leave us alone.” One of the students had stepped forwards from the others to say this. He was calm and held an air of authority amongst them, as if he meant something more to the group than the rest. It had been his joke that triggered the laughter in the first place.

&#x200B;

Something about the demeanor of the man upset Vic profoundly and it came through clearly in his words. “Don’t tell me to chill out! Don’t tell me to do anything! Stop talking!” Each of these things Vic stated came out on a shout uttered ravenously. He stepped closer to the man and I could see now that he was tightening his fists as he walked towards the group leader. He was reaching a point now that had cowed many in the past, but his chosen adversary seemed unshaken by the growing fury in his eyes. I started to grow sick. I’d seen this scenario play out more than once in the past, and given the heightened situations I’d seen coming home I only knew that this time would be worse. So, to save an unwitting victim, I put myself in the line of fire.

&#x200B;

“Vic!” I shouted, while waving and feigning a smile on my face.

&#x200B;

There was a stutter of sorts in his movements, followed by a flash of recognition, and then he turned. Vic came to face me, still with his face ablaze, but then the gaze softened. His rage seemed to be gradually replaced with excitement as we locked eyes, and then he spoke.

&#x200B;

“Oh shit you’re finally here! I was beginning to wonder if you’d decided not to come.” The tone of his voice came as excitement and relief. It still held his innate crossness, but softened by friendly intent. Maybe this wouldn’t be so bad after all.

&#x200B;

“As if I wouldn’t visit you? Did you really think I’d pass you by after you saved my ass in that fistfight with Brad and his cronies? I still owe you big time for that one.” It was becoming easier to smile now and my false interest in our interaction had transitioned into candor. It was becoming clearer in my mind that Vic had always been there to get me out of hairy situations, he got things done, and now the gears in my head were turning.

&#x200B;

“That fistfight was years ago and we haven’t seen each other since, so yeah. Still happy to see you though. Can’t say the same for Gil, but I guess the two of you are a package deal at the moment so I’ll have to manage.” He glared at Gill as he spoke.

&#x200B;

That was when Gil interjected. “Our friend and I are a duo born out of necessity. He not only doesn’t have a car, but also completely forgot how to navigate the area! It’s hard to believe that a man could get lost in his own hometown, but this guy has gone and done it. He’d have no hope of finding any of you again if it weren’t for me! Anyways, I’m gonna go grab us some beers. Maybe you can catch him up on how round two with Brad went.” Gil left us then, going to the bar, nonchalantly.

&#x200B;

Vic’s eyes followed Gil as he made pace away from us, and once he was out of earshot, he then spoke. “Is that asshole really the only person you could’ve gotten to give you a lift? Everytime I see that smug blonde shit I wanna pound him into paste.”

&#x200B;

“It wasn’t a planned thing Vic, none of this was. I just woke up in the station this afternoon and he was there waiting for me.” I glanced then, to see if Gil was still ordering, and continued on. “He’s taken me prisoner. I know that sounds ridiculous, but some of the things they did to me earlier tonight…”

&#x200B;

“Fuck off.” Vic spouted.

&#x200B;

“What?” I choked out the words in fear.

&#x200B;

“Fuck off to wherever you were before this, while you still can.” Vic spoke quickly and while he did I saw the vein in the center of his forehead begin to wriggle like a worm. He then strode off towards Gil with a bowling ball in his hand.

&#x200B;

I stood there for a moment, stunned, but as Vic reached his destination and began to take a swing with that perforated orb he held I knew I had to seize the lifeline he’d thrown me. I ran, past the lanes, out the doors, and back to the neon lit streets. For a moment I was held in paralysis. Where would I go? to the station? Where was the station? Then recollection hit me and I knew I’d need to take a left.

&#x200B;

As I ran I went past the glistening black car that had held me for most of the night and I paused for a moment. If Gil was able to get the upper hand he’d easily be able to catch me in this thing. That was when I saw it, a long shard of glass lying on the sidewalk. A bleeding gash across my palm was the price I paid to shove that shard into the car tire, and I was back to running in no time at all.

&#x200B;

It was about five blocks down that my lungs failed me. I’m ashamed to admit it, but I wasn’t the runner I’d used to be. I walked from then on, through the rain on wet concrete by street. The light pitter patter of rainfall almost started to lull me into comfort, despite the cold and damp that it brought, and for a moment I felt safe.

&#x200B;

Until I saw it. Until I saw the reflection.

&#x200B;

Shining back at me, from the rear window of an old hatchback car, were those shining golden locks, moving closer and closer. He was coming. Somehow Gil had prevailed against the one person amongst my friends who’d never lost a fight and now he was coming to take me back. I didn’t doubt that Vic’s body would be lying in that bowling alley, battered beyond recognition. If Gil caught up he’d take me back there and tell me about how it was all my fault, so I ran. Under the rain and over the sidewalk my feet made way to the station that served as a gateway to my freedom. However, Gil grew ever closer, and with each moment the sound of his footsteps grew ever more audible. My fear overtook me then and I looked over my shoulder to see him as I ran.

&#x200B;

I’ll regret doing that forever.

&#x200B;

He was barely recognizable in that state then. Only by the hair and tattered clothes that hung about it could I recognize the body as his, as Gil’s. Its limbs hung loose and were elongated as if they’d been stretched beyond repair. The hands were barely that, more like stubs than anything else, and blood flowed  freely from where the fingers once were. The jaw was the worst, elongated and loose as if its bottom had been wholly shattered, hanging freely in the air. The worst part of it all was that in spite of all of its maiming, the thing bore down on me with blinding speed and would likely soon overtake me.

&#x200B;

I had scarcely a chance to outrun him and given other circumstances I think he would have caught me. To the person who left their bicycle out, unlocked, and on the corner of King and Borz I just want to say thank you, and also your bicycle is probably somewhere near the sidewalk by central station. Were it not for your carelessness that night I likely wouldn’t be writing this, so thank you.

&#x200B;

I made speed on that unwitting gift, that bicycle that had saved me, and with its aid I was able to outpace the assailant that wore what was left of Gil’s mangled face. Making it to the station in due time, I arrived to find that a train was resting there for a moment and would soon be departing. How lucky was I? Though most of my strength had already been spent, I mustered enough to make it to the platform before the doors closed. With a hurried explanation and an unmatching ticket, I was able to get onboard. Then the doors closed, and I was safe.

&#x200B;

I took a seat and glanced anxiously . The place was vacant save for some staff I’d dealt with on the way in. A moment later the train lurched into motion. I exhaled then, as if I’d been holding my breath all night, and felt myself relax. We were moving and I was safe.

&#x200B;

Then I looked out the window.

&#x200B;

Radiant hair darted toward the window on its mount of spindly and torn appendages. We were out of the station then, and as the train had yet to gain significant speed, Gil was increasingly gaining on us. It ran up, right to my window, and blood spurted out of the open maw and onto the glass as the thing that was once Gil rammed its head into the pane.

&#x200B;

Then the train picked up speed, and we were gone.

&#x200B;

Every day since then I’ve thought back to that night, to the ride I was forced on, to the people I left behind, and I wonder if I could have done things better. Maybe with a little more forethought, planning, and assertiveness I could have traversed that place at my own whims rather than his. I wonder if Seth is still alive, rotting away on that couch. I wonder if my memories of Kate will ever return to normal, or if I’ll ever see her again. I wonder most of all about what Vic and Gil did to each other, how they brutalized one another in a bid for my agency, and if either of them are still alive. I’m prisoner to these thoughts, to the guilt that carries my mind into a personal reproach against failings I couldn’t have helped, and I wonder if I’ve really escaped at all.

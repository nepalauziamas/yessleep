let’s just get this started. It was a Thursday night this January, I just finished a couple of tests and i was completely ready to wind down and get some rest. I decided to watch whatever was on TV, I decided to start watching a movie even though it started a while ago. At a point i was hooked, my eyes refused to leave the screen, and I was greatly invested in the story. Out of nowhere, a bright white flashed in front of my eyes, fully white, in a room of pure darkness disregarding the TV. I’ve had these a couple times, but this one was odd, it lasted for a good second and i couldn’t see anything for that time. I was disoriented and dizzy, i had completely lost all of my focus I gained by watching this movie. I decided it was a good idea to go downstairs, grab some water, and crash out for the night. 

I headed down the stairs, and made my way over to the cups, then to the sink where I filled up the cup, chugged it, and filled it up again. But as i was walking away from the sink, a book fell down, “guess I’ll pick it back up” I thought to myself, but as I reached down to grab the book, it disappeared, i looked around until I saw it sitting in it’s original position, untouched, and then something caught my eye out of left field. it was clearly in the room next to me. I don’t know what it was but it resembled something…humanoid-ish? I really can’t describe it as anything other than strange. “Oh well, you’re probably just imagining things” I thought to myself, trying my best to calm myself down, because, well, I knew I saw something. 

I walked up the stairs quickly but steadily, trying not to spill my water. I looked over my shoulder multiple times on the way back to my room, making sure I wasn’t being followed. After several minutes of trying to calm myself down, I set down the glass of water on my nightstand, and crawled into bed. I was getting comfortable in my bed but i realized that in the blink of an eye, i wasn’t in bed anymore, instead, I was laying on the hardwood floor downstairs. I got myself up, stumbling as I lost my balance. “I can’t sleep in my room anymore, I’m gonna go to the couch.” I whispered to myself, but as I was heading over to the couch, I saw the humanoid figure again. This time I was able to get a better look at it. It was about 7 feet tall, slim, long arms and legs, and had hands that looked like the talons of an eagle, put on a giant. “Since when did NBA players break into houses?“ I said to myself, offering comic relief, even though I was mortified, even though I knew it didn’t see me, he was looking out the window, idly, barely moving anything except for it’s hands.
 
I walked over to the pantry and grabbed the sharpest knife I could find, and I checked over to see if it was still looking out there, it was… but it was flickering. Within the span of a second, it was there, not there, then there again. Uhhhhh, i’m gonna get the hell out of here. I walked to the stairs again, but as I was about 10 feet away from the first step, the thing flashed in front of me for a tenth of a second. I could make out a couple more defining features now. The thing was yellow, all over, and for the most part it looked human, at least the face did. The face was oddly welcoming, from what I saw, it had normal features, a wide grin, with normal, white teeth, and that’s about it. However, something was off, something that made it not human, if that wasn’t apparent enough already, but i couldn’t put my finger on it. I was scared out of my mind, I started to run towards the stairs, but once I hit the third step, I fell…

I don’t know what happened, but I just fell through the stairs, falling for a couple seconds. the black void turned into hardwood floor as I was on the other side of the house. I was paranoid at this point, nothing around me is real, I could fall through anything. Luckily, I didn’t have to revisit that staircase again, as there is another set of stairs on the side of the house i’m on right now, which happens to be close to my room, but a decent distance (house wise) from the kitchen. I made my way up the stairs, being careful for every step. I did it, I made it to my room. I locked my door, closed my blinds, and checked to see if my door was locked, just in case, before shuffled over to my bed, tapping it and applying pressure to it, making sure it’s solid, yup. 

I lay down and turn on the TV, i’m not even gonna bother sleeping. I wake up the next day, and everything is normal, except me. Though I tell myself my parents are going to send me to a mental hospital if I tell them about this, so instead I searched for plausible explanations, was I on drugs? (what???? I don’t even take drugs!) (is my carbon monoxide fine? I have a detector!) (was it just a dream?) a dream could make sense, but it felt more real than any moment of my life, which really made me feel uncomfortable, and rule out the possibility of it being a dream. 

Everything was normal from that point on, until yesterday, I saw the yellow thing again, no longer than the first time unfortunately, and I was moved out of nowhere when sitting on my phone. Nothing like this has happened to me, and for all of this in one night to happen, was truly a traumatic experience. I think I’m fine, but I have plans to move out of the house i’m living in, I can afford a bigger one anyways. But money doesn’t worry me right now, I just want to get the hell out of here

btw, here’s a picture of the yellow thing, i’m no artist, but if someone can recognize it, please let me know, I want to know more about it. https://imgur.com/a/pA1cCpE

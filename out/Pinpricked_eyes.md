  One night I was visiting a friends house we will call her A, A and I were taking a few bong rips while jamming out a session of Halo 2 in her garage. We were home alone and everything went normal for the most part. Until it got late, I’d say around 12:30 am is when we first noticed it. There was a tall dark figure lurking in the shadows by the garage door. We both just laughed it off at first thinking it was from our long gaming session or the amount of monsters and vodka we just drank (we made our own 4 Loko type of cocktail). So we just closed the door and carried on battling the flood.

  A little while later maybe around 1 am is when it started. Loud bashing came from the door as if someone was trying to beat it down. It startled both of us and I loudly yelled “oh fuck what the hell was that!?”. She got up to investigate thinking maybe it could have been a crackhead of sorts (where we live, it’s not the safest place in the world). She flips on the outside light and takes a peak, nothing. “That’s weird there’s nobody here..” she said confused and a little disturbed. “Well maybe it was a stray cat trying to find shelter?” I said getting weirded out. “Yeah probably, hey let’s finish we’re almost done with the flood!” She excitedly bantered as she skipped back over. “Hell yeah dude let’s get this!”.

   A and I just pressed play on our controllers when it happens again. THUMP, THUMP, THUMP… SMASH! I threw my drink on accident from the extremely loud noise. “Okay Fucking what dude I’m way to drunk for this shit!” She exclaimed clearly started and now freaked out. The time is now 1:30 am and the alcohol monster death drink we made has hit us like a truck. “Bro I don’t know what or who the fuck that was but I am not having any of this.” I said getting agitated. I then grabbed a baseball bat her brother used and charged the door, almost knocking myself over as I shoulder bashed through it. To my surprise it was nothing… just a stray black cat sitting eerily under the street light. I immediately burst out laughing as she come rushing over to see. When she saw the cat she joined me laughing, in our haze of booze we failed to check the rest of the house and promptly forgot about the thumping and crash. That was our mistake.

  We both sit back down on her couch and make another cocktail, in hindsight was also a mistake. It had begun to rain now, the soft trickling of water droplets sliding down the roof mixed with the alcohol nullified any effect the monster gave us. We were drowsy and ready to pass out. She had fallen asleep and as I drunkenly gazed at the soft glow of the tv I saw it. There it was. Just out of reach of direct light but enough in the way I could see it’s pinpricked white eyes. It pierced my soul. I quickly jumped up knocking over the table, also stubbing my toe. “FUCK WHAT” I exclaimed in pain and confused. It was gone. From the sudden movement I had to piss, so I went into the house and down the hallway to the restroom. I checked my phone, 3:00 am the clock read. “Shiiiiiiiit…” I said to myself. The time was alluding us. I flush the toilet and head towards the kitchen for a slice of left over pizza. I almost shit myself when I saw my reflection in the window. It was behind me. Whipping my head around drunkenly shouting “who the fuck are you!?”, but to no avail, nothing. I head back into the garage to see her passed out. I lay down next to her and drift away as well.

   3:30 am. A blood curdling scream woke me up, still drunk and hungover I jump from the couch and make haste toward where it came from. The sound had come from the bathroom, it was A. I flip the light on and vomited at the sight. There she was, disemboweled, eyes rolled back into her head as this thing is holding her up by the rib cage. It’s eyes piercing me as it looked back. I stumble backwards speechless. A wet splatter followed by a thump, her body slid off of its razor sharp claws I started running as fast as I could, I turned a corner back to the garage and tripped, slamming my head into the concrete and corner of the coffee table.

   I’m woken up to the sound of birds and cars on her street. Hazily with a raging headache and lump on my temple I stand up. Remembering about A I ran back to the restroom to find nothing. No blood, guts, or A. I searched the house, nothing, she was no where to be found. I can’t explain what I saw and the missing persons poster has been up for a few months now. The police and her family chalked it up to her running away but I know she didn’t. This thing took her, I know it did. They said I was crazy for thinking that but I know better. Late at night now sometimes in the reflection of a window or mirror I see it. I see it’s eyes, piercing me the same way it did that night. It’s coming for me. I don’t know how long I have but I had to share this, it eats me alive inside.

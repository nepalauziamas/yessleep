My mom was murdered a year ago. I lived with her in a one-bedroom apartment on the first floor – it was just the two of us, trying to make ends meet, until the day she left for work and never came back. In the weeks following her death, I’d never felt so alone, and fell into a deep depression. She was my best friend, and the only person I ever trusted. Growing up, I had no memory of my dad, and mom refused to talk about him any time I asked. But from listening in on her late-night phone calls to her friends, I got the impression he was a wealthy man who left us for another woman, just after she gave birth to me. That was pretty much all I could gather over years of eavesdropping.

The morning of the day she died seemed just like any other – she told me not to oversleep and said her final goodbye before the front door shut. Being half asleep, I barely heard the last words she ever said to me. Mom worked behind the counter at a gas station, around a 40-minute drive away. I lucked out and managed to find a waitress job within walking distance, much closer to home. Her shift finished earlier though, so she would always be home first. That day, she wasn’t in when I came back. I thought it was strange but figured she might’ve gone to the bar to meet a friend or something, so didn’t read too much into it. I flopped on the couch and turned on the TV.

A familiar report flashed up – this one had been on the news for weeks. A former security guard was on the run after murdering his lawyer brother in a hit and run. His ex-wife released a photo for the media. The photo was taken while he was raising his hand, as if he was trying to hide his face from the lens. A couple years prior to the murder, he’d been assaulted on duty which led to half his face being melted away. His left jaw was misshapen, and you could almost see his teeth through what was left of his cheek. His hair was middle-parted, and he had grown it out longer at the front, as if trying to cover his wrecked visage. It was a memorable and unsettling case for sure, but I didn’t think much of it at the time, as the crime had taken place practically on the other side of the country. These kinds of things would pop up on the news often.

I continued to watch TV until an hour later, when I received a call that would change my life. My mom’s Fiat had been found upside-down at the bottom of a cliff; her body still strapped in the driver’s seat. She had veered off the road and driven off the side, crashing through a set of rails. As soon as paramedics arrived on the scene, they knew she was a lost cause. Her neck was broken, her skull crushed. No substances were found in her system, but they ruled her death accidental. She wasn’t the type to drive irresponsibly, in fact she preached the importance of safe driving to me regularly. I was left grieving and in disbelief. But after reality sunk in, I had no choice other than to accept that shit happens, even to the best of us… or so I thought.

About a month after mom’s death, I began to get the feeling that I was being watched or followed on numerous occasions. Perhaps it had started earlier, but I would have been too distracted by the grief to notice. I brushed it off the first couple of times – just little things, like hearing footsteps behind me while walking alone at night, then turning to see no one there, or other sounds when I was supposed to be alone.

I shrugged them off but found myself becoming increasingly paranoid when these signs became more frequent over time. For a couple of weeks, I kept shrugging it off as part of having to adjust to living alone, or a side effect of my grief.

The turning point, however, was during work one day. My manager pulled me to the side while I was carrying a stack of plates and told me that a short, bald man had just come into the restaurant and asked if I worked there. He asked why, and the man just left. This was strange, as I couldn’t think of who this person could be. My manager made a few suggestions – boyfriend? Relative? Old friend? I shook my head at all of them. No short bald men came to mind. He raised his eyebrows and told me to carry on.

I did just that, but felt increasingly uneasy about this throughout the day. I couldn’t stop thinking about it. At the end of my shift, I went to ask my manager for more details about the encounter, but he had already gone home. The restaurant was relatively empty now – all the customers had left, and it was just me and another co-worker who lived upstairs anyway, so she was always there. It was 8pm and getting quite dark, so I figured I should get home as soon as possible. I said goodbye to my co-worker and left, walking slightly faster than usual this time. The walk back to my apartment usually took 15 minutes, but I could make it in 10 if I tried.

I was more aware of my surroundings than usual during that walk and kept looking behind me. That led to me noticing a black Mercedes with tinted windows turning into my road behind me, about a hundred yards away. The first time I looked back, it was pulling over. Most of the complexes on my street had underground parking lots, so usually there were none parked on the side of the road. The street was empty, illuminated only by a couple street lamps. As I walked a bit further, I heard the engine start up again. I felt it creeping closer behind me. This time, I turned around and stood still, staring at it for a few seconds directly. It rolled a couple yards before pulling over again. I continued to stare.

Suddenly, the driver’s side door opened and a tall man wearing a ski mask and black trench coat jumped out and started running towards me at full speed. He was huge, had broad shoulders and was at least 6”4. As soon as I processed what was happening, I turned and ran as fast as possible, screaming at the top of my lungs.

My heart was in my mouth, my legs suddenly weak as I sensed him closing the gap. I fumbled around in my pockets for my keys and stumbled into the complex, then up the stairs to the first floor, unlocked the door as fast as I could and crashed inside, still screaming. I immediately locked the door and barricaded it with two couches and a desk.

Pulse still racing and mascara dripping down my face from my tears, I crept up to my bedroom window which overlooked my street and scanned it. The man was nowhere to be seen, but I could still see the black Mercedes at the end of the street.

I got out my phone and started to dial 911, but before I could press the call button, I received a text from an unknown number.

*“You don’t want to do that.”*

I froze, realising the possibility that someone was still watching me.

It had just sunk in that whoever this was, they would probably get to me before any cops could. Just as I thought I had gotten to safety, the intense panic returned. I looked around my room frantically as I tried to control my sobbing. No one under the bed. No one in the closet. But somehow, someone was watching.

*“Who are you?”* I texted back, my hands shaking so much I could barely type. A reply came almost immediately.

*“I have been watching you for a while. I know everything about you.”*

Another message followed. *“We have hacked your phone and computer. We can see everything you do. If you attempt to call emergency services or tell anyone about this, you be killed.”*

I was hyperventilating at this point, at a complete loss about what to do. Maybe I could make it if I made a run for it? But to where, and what if he was outside the door waiting for me? I prayed that someone had heard my screams and would call 911 on my behalf, as I melted into a puddle on the floor, shaking, wondering if this would be my last day alive.

*“What do you want?”* I texted.

No reply. Just silence, and the ringing in my ears.

After this, nothing happened for hours. I stayed in my room in absolute terror as the night became darker, alternating between crying, looking out of the window and expecting anyone to try to break in or jump out of any corner at any moment. But nothing. A few pedestrians passed by but I was too scared to yell out for help. During those hours, I felt the worst fear I had ever experienced in my life.

Things continued like this until around midnight, when I spotted a man walking towards my apartment complex under the dim streetlights. He was short, bald and wearing a backpack. Although I hadn’t seen him before, I figured he was one of the residents, and contemplated calling out to him. However, my fear held me back and I stayed silent, watching him approaching the bottom of the complex. Then I spotted the Mercedes car door open. The man in the black trench coat got out and started walking briskly towards the complex. He caught up to the short man and took him by surprise.

I watched in horror as he covered the short man’s mouth from behind and slit his throat in one quick motion. He dragged the body further towards the base of the complex where they disappeared out of view. A minute later, the man in the trench coat emerged, dragging a large suitcase to his car. He stuffed it in the boot and got in the driver’s seat.

A few seconds later, I received a message.

*“I will be waiting for you at work tomorrow. Go to work, complete your shift as normal and return home. If you see me, do not approach me. If you refuse to show up or tell anyone about this situation, we will shoot up the place in broad daylight. Then we will come for you.”*

Considering what I had just seen, this was far from an empty threat.

*“Why me?”* I texted back. No response.

I didn’t sleep a wink that night, a million theories and conjectures brewing in my mind, trying to make sense of my ordeal. Where had he gone, and why had he killed the man? The feeling of being watched never left. The next day, ten minutes before I usually left for work, the Mercedes started up and drove away. Once he was out of view’s field, I had the urge to call 911 and bet my life on the cops being faster, but remembered there was probably more than one person in on this. So I complied.

I showed up to work as instructed and spotted the Mercedes in the restaurant parking lot. Inside the restaurant, trench coat man was waiting for me, sitting at the furthest table. He wore a top hat, black mask and sunglasses, and was staring down at his cell phone. Going through that day as he had told me to, knowing I could be responsible for the deaths of several innocent people, was unbearable. The gut-wrenching fear consumed me throughout the day as I pretended nothing was wrong, knowing full well every moment could be my last.

The same thing happened the next day, and the next. I showed up to work, he was there the entire time. I completed my shift, nobody suspected anything, and I didn’t say a word. I would run home in terror and lock the door. Minutes later, the Mercedes would always appear and pull up on my street within my field of vision from the window and remained there as long as I was inside. I locked myself in my apartment through the nights and weekends, half the time staring out of the window with my guts in a knot, the other half writing my experiences in a notebook, hoping someone would find it if I met my end.

As this went on day by day, my confusion remained, but the fear slowly subsided, and frustration took its place. I was being stalked and controlled for some unknown purpose by this man, and I didn’t have the courage to do anything about it. I realised I could never forgive myself if I caused my co-workers’ and customers’ deaths.

On the tenth day of this torture, I’d had enough. Running on 2 hours’ sleep a night on average and practically no food for the past 10 days, I decided this was my breaking point.

I took out my cell phone and called the unknown number at 1.30am. No response.

“I want to talk,” I texted. Again, no response. I sighed and began crying, for the first time not out of fear, but frustration and hopelessness.

A few minutes later, to my surprise, a reply came.

*“Meet me in the car.”*

I grabbed a kitchen knife and my keys, and hesitantly walked out of the front door. To say I was scared would be an understatement, but the desire to end this was greater. If I didn’t confront my stalker, this ordeal would never end.

Walking down the street, I stopped to look around me every few seconds. The street was empty and silent, shrouded by the dead of night. Around 20 yards away I received a text.

*“Get in the back and close the door.”*

I approached the vehicle and heard the doors unlock. I hesitantly opened the back door.

“Get in,” said a deep, raspy voice. I got in, against my better judgement, and closed the door. He locked the doors immediately. There was a foul stench in the air.

He was wearing the ski mask and made eye contact with me through the rear-view mirror. I stared back, eyes wide.

“I decided against this originally,” he began, “but I changed my mind.”

I continued staring into the mirror in silence, heart racing uncontrollably. There was a laptop on the dashboard, streaming live camera footage from the front of my apartment complex, and two blank screens labelled ‘PC’ and ‘phone’.

He took off his hat and mask. My mouth fell open on its own, and I had to cover it to prevent myself screaming. In the dim light, I could only make out that the left side of his deformed face was stretched into a skeletal grin. But he was unmistakably the runaway killer on the news. The fear came back, as soon as the regret sank in. He made a ‘shh’ gesture, and pulled out a gun, waving it around before turning around and pointing it at me.

“One sound, and you’re as good as dead.”

I nodded frantically. He turned back around.

“You’re being targeted. That’s all you have to know.” He looked away for a moment.

“B-by who?” I trembled in confusion.

“That’s all you have to know,” he repeated.

Silence reigned. A minute long pause ensued. I didn’t know what to say or do next.

“The bald guy – was he… targeting me?”

“He was on his way to strangle you. Good thing he’s in the boot now.”

“But why me?” I asked, struggling to process everything he had just told me. “I’ve haven’t done anything to anyone. I’ve grown up here my whole life.”

“Oh, woe is me,” he mocked. “Not everything’s about you, bitch. Shit’s a lot deeper than you would ever know.”

“What do you mean?”

He sighed, glaring at me through the mirror. His disfigured reflection was a terrifying spectacle.

“Your dad killed my brother and framed me for it. Bastard’s getting me to do his dirty work now. Once I’m done, he’s giving me a new face and identity. Then I’m off.”

“My dad? What does he have to do with this?”

“He’s filthy rich now, but still has some bad blood from a couple years back. A couple enemies. He scammed a gang of dealers in the 90’s, and they slaughtered his family for it.”

He made eye contact with me again.

“The ones he gave a fuck about anyway. Then he leaked the fact that he still had family in this state, in hopes of baiting them out and getting rid of them. You’re the bait, kid.”

I was in disbelief.

“Did they kill mom?” I asked, tears welling up in my eyes.

“The guy next to you did.”

I turned to see a suitcase in the seat next to mine, and retched, covering my mouth.

“Try not to throw up. Already smells like dog shit in here.”

“W-what happened? How did she die?”

“He rammed her off the side of the cliff and sped off. You know the rest. Came for you next, but I got him first.”

“How long have you been following me?”

He turned around, and I leaned back, startled.

“Ever since she died. Three guys taken out so far.”

“Jesus,” I cried, “how many are there?”

“A few goons for sure, but there’s one guy I’ve been assigned to. I’m banking on him coming for you.”

He pulled out a picture on his phone.

“Know him?”

The man looked to be in his 40’s or 50’s, had long matted brown hair and crooked teeth. His face was plastered in tattoos of strange symbols and shapes. The picture practically screamed ‘dealer’.

“Don’t think so,” I replied, “I think I’d remember if I saw that.”

“Think harder then,” he spat. “My life depends on getting this fucker.”

He turned back around.

“How can you be so sure my dad will keep his promise?”

“He’s been a man of his word so far. As have I. If he doesn’t keep to it, I’ll end him. The old cracker knows that.”

“He framed and blackmailed you.”

“I tried to steal from him. He warned there would be consequences, and I got them. Now I’m a wanted man. As I said, I could off the guy, but he’s the only one that can get me a reset.” He paused, almost growling with rage now. “I thought I was signing up for any other security job. Never wanted to get dragged into this murder shit. Took acid in the face for this guy, and this is how he repays me. But all I want is a normal life back. If I have to kill to get it, I will.”

I remembered the news report. His ex-wife clearly dodged a bullet.

“What are you going to do now?” I asked.

“I figured if he was coming for you, he would have done it by now. It’s possible he noticed the other guys weren’t going back, so he’s laying low at the moment. He’ll probably show up soon. You sure you haven’t seen him?”

“I don’t recall,” I said, “do they know anything apart from my address and where I work?”

“That’s what I wanted to ask you,” he said. “Any other places you went often?”

I shook my head, not wanting to endanger more people and lead him around town on a killing spree.

“We’ll wait here then. Don’t think you’re getting out until that man’s dead. Could be a while, so do me a favor and text your boss.”

I hesitantly wrote a text to my manager, explaining I had a family emergency and wouldn’t be in work for a while. As soon as I turned on my phone screen, an image flashed up on his laptop screen. My words appeared on his laptop screen in real time as I typed, sending shivers down my spine.

He opened a front compartment, revealing what looked like a month’s supply of energy bars, and threw me one, along with a bottle of water. Then he handcuffed me to the suitcase. I tried to ask him more about the whole situation with my dad, but he told me to shut up every time, so we ended up sitting in silence for three days in the company of the dead bodies of men that had tried to kill me.

I woke up on the third night to find myself alone in the car. The street was dark and quiet as usual, and trench coat man was nowhere to be found. His laptop was still on the dash. My heart started racing, as I realised this was my chance. Both hands still cuffed to the suitcase, I dragged the thing with all my might as I wriggled my way from the back to the driver’s seat, and looked around for a key to no avail. Just as I was planning my escape, the camera screen flashed on from the laptop, and I looked out to see him dragging a suitcase, coming out of the apartment complex. He glanced over at the car briefly. It looked like he hadn’t noticed my change in position through the darkness and tinted windows. He dragged the case around the back of the car and tossed it in the boot. Panicking, I tried to get back into the back seat before he arrived, but the suitcase had lodged itself in the way. Just as it slipped toward me, giving my arms a wider range of motion, the driver’s side door opened.

Thinking fast, I grabbed the kitchen knife I’d kept hidden on the inside of my jacket and plunged it into the left side of his abdomen. He staggered back for a second, dazed, then shut the door and went around the front. He opened the passenger side door, got in and pulled pointed at me. In the moment, I was pretty sure I was a goner.

“Drive,” he said.

I was frozen in panic.

“Just fucking drive or I’ll shoot you and drive this thing myself,” he choked, sounding more exasperated than angry. He was clutching his abdomen with his left hand. Underneath his coat, a large red stain had appeared on his shirt. He handed me a set of keys, and I managed to unlock the handcuffs. I stuck the largest one in the ignition and stepped on the gas, still being held at gunpoint.

He told me which turns to make, and I obliged. Through a series of twists and turns, I was quickly led into unfamiliar territory, and found myself driving down a long, wide stretch of road. The other traffic had been left behind, and it was just dark and quiet.

“It’s done,” he said. I looked at him.

“I got the guy. Now I’ll be paying your dad a visit. Take a left turn and pull over once you see the stop sign.”

I did just that.

“Thanks,” he said, catching me off guard. He finally lowered the pistol. “Get out. I’ll take it from here.”

“Wait, you’re just gonna leave me here?”

He shot me a glare, and I quickly opened the door. He reached into his pocket and handed me a tenner, then gestured me out as he slid painfully into the driver’s seat. He had taken off his trench coat and ripped off the sleeves, using them as a makeshift tourniquet over his bloodied shirt.

“Night bus on the other side of the road comes every hour.”

I stared at him for a second. He paused and looked straight at me, his mangled face expressionless. His hair cast dark shadows over his eyes.

“You’ll be alright.” For a second, I thought he tried to smile. He closed the door and drove off.

I took the bus into the town center and checked myself into a hotel, collapsing onto the bed. I was too weak and tired to process my trauma. Morning rolled around, and after showering off the stench of death, I ate a meal for the first time in days. I finally went to the cops, told them everything as best as I could remember and gave them permission to search my apartment. The license plate of the Mercedes turned out to be fake (not much of a surprise there), and to my knowledge, the investigation didn’t lead anywhere – not to trench coat guy, my dad (allegedly) or any of the guys that were out to get me. Blood samples found in my apartment didn’t match any database records.

I used all my savings to move state and change my identity. Since then, I’ve managed to pick my life up slightly, but it’s been far from easy. I’ve gotten a new job and apartment. Whether what trench coat guy said about my dad was true, one thing’s for sure – I’ll have trust issues for life. I never open the door when anyone knocks. I look behind me every three seconds, wherever I am. I’m waiting for the day my boss tells me there’s who I don’t know someone looking for me.

As for trench coat guy, I texted him a week ago. I felt crazy, but I guess the paranoia got to me. Regardless of the other shit he did, he did save my life a couple of times, and now I’m alone, I can’t seem to trust anyone else.

*“Are you there?”*

No response for a few days. I figured he’d probably gotten his plastic surgery and moved to Hawaii or something to start his new “normal” life.

This morning, I finally received a reply. It was a photo of a body on a stretcher, with two people carrying it at either end, their hands just visible. It was covered with a black trench coat, obscuring its head all the way down to its thighs. His legs and feet, still clothed in dress pants and shoes, stuck out from beneath his shroud.

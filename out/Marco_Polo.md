Marie and Melissa were known for being opposites of each other. Marie was loud, always loved to crack a joke and make some friends, and just have fun in general. Melissa on the other hand, was always quite, barely communicated with anyone, and had a soft for animals and plushies. Both of them loved each other dearly. Despite Marie being obnoxious sometimes, Melissa tolerated her.

One day, one the night after their graduation, and before the first day of summer break. Marie came up with an idea that her and Melissa could do. She explained to Melissa that at around 12AM, they would sneak out of the house and play Marco Polo, and at 3AM, they would head back home. Of course, Melissa was a bit hesitant on the idea. She didn’t want to get in trouble with her parents. But after a bit of convincing, Melissa knew she had to face the music, and decided to agree to come with Marie.

At 12AM, the girls snuck out of their room and out of the house, and headed to the nearby woods. The girls ventured until they couldn’t see the exit. That’s when they started playing. 

Usually when people played Marco Polo, the tagger “Marco”, had to find the other people while their eyes were closed. And the other people running from the Marco had to shout Polo, in order to lure Marco to them. However since it was too dark. The sisters had to resort to whoever was Marco, had to use their eyesight, and the game would be much easier with flashlights. 

The girls played around in the forest, gleefully laughing as they both caught one another. Soon it was 3AM, and it was time to go back home, but there was one slight problem.

When Marie called out to Melissa saying it’s 3AM, and they needed to get back home or their parents will find out. There was no response. Worried that Melissa probably went too deep into the forest, Marie called out to her, but louder. No response again-

#”Polo!”

Marie’s heart jumped for a second. Was that Melissa? It sounded like her sister. But for some reason, Marie didn’t believe it. “Melissa! Are you there!”

#”Polo!”

The voice that sounded like Melissa boomed again. This did not sound like Melissa. Something about the voice sounded off, the more it said “Polo” the voice became more slowed, or high pitched.

Marie didn’t want to stay for long, and got scared and started running. She dashed throughout the forest. Calling Melissa’s name. But the only response Marie got was “Polo!”.
The forest seemed to be endless, Marie was questioning where on earth was Melissa.

She probably got out before Marie. Or maybe she’s still in the forest? The thoughts raced down Marie’s head. She had to get out of the forest. There’s got to be an exit. Right?

Two days later, two missing persons signs were pasted all over the neighborhood. Everyone desperately searched for Marie and Melissa, yet no one could ever find the sisters. Everyone knew they had to be somewhere. But for what some knew. Whenever they went into the local forest. They could hear something in the distance, apparently those people claim that they heard a young girl, they didn’t know who it was, but it seemed like she kept on repeating a word over and over again.

#”Polo!”

***DING***

I groaned. Straining my eyes open, I rolled over in my bed. My clock read 12:45 AM. *”God, really?”* It was *way* too early for this shit — I had work in the morning.

*”Who the hell was trying to call me at THIS time of night?”*  I grabbed my phone. I winced when the screen blinked to life. In the middle of the screen was a “missed call” message, along with a voicemail. When I looked to see who it was, the I.D. was listed as **”UNKNOWN”**.

*”Probably a damn telemarketer or maybe a bot, trying to sell me something”*, I thought, putting my phone back on the nightstand before rolling over and going back to sleep. The next morning, I saw that I had about five missed calls and voicemails, all from that number. *”What the fuck?”*

I opened one of the voice messages. Immediately, my phone let out an eardrum-shattering screech that caused me to drop it (which caused the screen to crack — *great..*). After about thirty seconds or so, though, the screeching noise died. Replacing it was a cloud of some sort of static, as well as the muffled sounds of what sounded like someone’s voice behind it.

I couldn’t make out a word of what was said, even trying to hold the speaker up to my ear. All I could hear was the static. I did notice, though, that the voice was of a man; deep, yet soft in a way. It sounded similar to me to the way my dad’s voice used to when I was little.

I could tell, whatever he was trying to say, it was urgent. His voice was frantically shouting *something* into the phone. I opened the other voice messages to see what they were; thinking maybe *they* would be a little clearer.

Nope. All of them; static, with the guy’s voice shouting, panicked, into the phone. *”Who is this?”*

I was about to try looking up the number on Google when my eyes caught sight of the time: 10:30. *”Fuck! I’m late!”*

With that, I quickly threw on my clothes and ran out the front door of my house. I ended up being indeed five minutes late for my shift at the office. Fortunately, given that this had only been the second time I’d shown up late since I began working at the company a little over a year ago (compared to others who usually were *always* late anyways), Valerie was willing to let me off with barely even a slap on the wrist.

I sat down at my desk and immediately turned my phone on silent and set it aside to let it charge until break. Around 12:30 or so, I idly glanced over to my phone, seeing it flash. Of course, looking a bit closer, what do I see; more messages, more voicemails — all from that “unknown number”.

There were about ten of them now, and more seemed to keep popping up. *”What the hell?”*

I wanted to open them, to see who or what the hell was going on. What was going on here? Why were they blowing up my phone? What do they want? *”Who even was this?”*

In spite of this, I did my best to try and just ignore it and continue working. I figured on lunch, I’d be able to look into it again. Finally, 2:00 rolled around and I could clock out for break. Taking my phone with me into the women’s room, just in case of any surprise noises like this morning, I clicked and played one of the more recent messages.

While I still couldn’t make heads or tails of what the hell the guy’s voice was saying, the static still dominating most of the overall sound, I *WAS* able to start distinguishing certain syllables and letters this time. In other words, it sounded this time like he was actually forming words, rather than just a mess of garbling like it was earlier. These sounds seemed to become more and more clear in the later messages.

As well as this, the man sounded a lot more anxious than before. These sounded like whomever was speaking was maybe hiding from something or someone. Whenever I tried to listen, though, to maybe see if I could put the sounds together and form a *vague* idea of what was being said, I was stumped. It all still sounded like a random combination of letters and sounds.

I remember at the time thinking that whoever it was, must’ve been trying to speak in tongues or something. Why, of course, was still a question that continued to slip me — aside from the idea that this was all the work of some jackass prank caller (who evidently has nothing better to do with his life). Even still, why was he so alarmed?

Finally, I tried searching the listed caller I.D. number on google. As you can probably guess, there was nothing. Admittedly, I can’t say that I expected to find much, considering the number was listed (644)699-6122. I mean, I was pretty sure that “644” wasn’t even a real area code. And according to the internet, it isn’t.

Still, how was it spamming my phone? Even if it were a crank caller or even possibly someone trying to hack my phone remotely, shouldn’t there be some kind of recognizable number? Granted, I’m not *MUCH* of a tech wiz (even if I DO work as a program designer) but wouldn’t scammers also need to use some sort of link or signal, one that’d bring up the number when it’s used?

At any rate, it wasn’t long before I’d end up having to stop digging to get back to work. Funny enough, maybe because I had to focus on making sure payroll was done before I got to go home or making sure the updates to the current systems of our program was processed, I ended up actually forgetting all about the shit going on with my phone. Though, that was until I saw the phone actually start *ringing*.

Across the top, in big letters, the I.D. read **”Unknown”**. No number or anything, just “Unknown”. I was gonna ignore it; let it go to voicemail again, when I realized that, ten minutes later, it was *still buzzing*. I was confused, how the heck was the phone still ringing? Shouldn’t it have gone to voicemail after like, a minute, tops?

Finally, I was able to excuse myself to the restroom again. Taking my phone, I locked myself in one of the stalls and hit “answer”. “Hello”, I said aggravated into the phone. For a moment, there was nothing but silence on the other end. “Look, whoever you are, I don’t know you and I’m not interested in whatever it is you’re trying to—“

The loud, shrill screech from before suddenly blasted the receiver, causing both my heart to skip about five beats in my chest, as well as me to hurl the phone into the stall door. On the ground, screen now shattered, my phone continued emitting that loud screeching noise before dying down and I began hearing the guy’s voice again. This time, I could actually hear some of what he was saying (despite the fact that it wasn’t on speaker). Faintly, between bouts of static and other words I still couldn’t quite make out, I could hear him shouting into the phone, “I can see you! We all can!”

"What", I asked into the phone, "What're you talking about?" I got no answer. The voice just continued rambling, repeating those words.

Finally, the call ended and the stall was quiet again. I just sat there for a second, bewildered. *"What the hell just happened?!"*

I slowly reached down and picked up my phone. The screen was totaled and I couldn't even get it to display anything or turn on. I sighed, rubbing my eyes. In all honesty, I felt too exhausted and just plain lost mentally in that moment that I barely even cared about the fact that I'd have to pay to have to get it fixed. Though, that *did* create one more question (among the already billions currently present), how was the call still connected after I broke it?

I could feel a headache coming on as I finally left the women's room. Needless to say, I was pretty much unable to concentrate on anything else but what was going on, which made trying to finish the updates damn near impossible. This didn't go unnoticed, either.

"Phoebe", I heard Valerie call from right behind me. Mildly startled, I snapped my head to face her. "God, Phoebe, you look *horrible!* Are you okay?*"*

I groaned. "Y-yeah, I'm... I'm fine."

"You don't look it."

I rubbed my eyes. "Sorry, I didn't really sleep well. I'm okay, though."

"Why don't you go home and get some rest?"

"Can't", I replied, looking back at my computer. "Gotta finish the updates, don't I?"

She put her hand on my shoulder and said, "Phoebe, go home. In fact, take the weekend off." I was about to try and push my case again (despite the fact that I was  *finally* getting a weekend off -- something I'd been trying to get for *months*), when she said "Don't worry about the updates. I can have Larry handle it. You just go home and get some rest." She winked and said "That's an order."

With that, I shut everything down and punched the clock. I was walking to my car when, from my pocket book, I heard something that sent my mind reeling. It was my phone, ringing.

*"What the? HOW?!"*

Hands shaking, I reached in and pulled out my phone. The screen was lit up with the word **"UNKNOWN"** across the top, along with the answer and decline buttons below it. Now I was starting to get really anxious. Who the fuck was this guy and why does he keep calling my phone? *"How is he calling it?! IT'S BROKEN, FOR GOD'S SAKES!"*

A chill crawled up my spine as I carefully tapped the "Answer" button. Shockingly, and disturbingly, it worked and I heard the call connect. This time, there was no screeching noise like before. Instead, it was just dead silent on the other end.

"H-Hello?"

Silence.

"Who is this?" This was met with what sounded like hoarse, labored breathing on the other end. "Hello", I repeated, "Who is this, and how did you get my number?" The breathing continued.

"This isn't funny! I'm about to go to the cops! Who are you, and what the hell do you want with me?!"

*"Phoebes",* a voice from the other end hissed. My eyes went wide. This wasn't the same voice as before.  *"Phoebe-cakes..."*

That was my husband's nickname for me. It was *his voice* on the other end! But that shouldn't have been possible. He'd been dead now for at least three years after overdosing on prescription pills. *"This can't be him... can it?"*

"H-H-Howard?" I could feel my throat closing up, making taking a breath a lot harder than it should've been. "H-Howie... I-Is that... Is that *you?!"*

*"Phoebes"*, I heard him rasp, *"I'm here. I can see you."*

I started throwing my head in every direction, "Where?! Where are you?!" As I did this, I heard the static buzz from before return, starting to blur out his already hard to hear voice.

*"I can see you, Phoebe. We all can."*

"What?"

*"We're always watching you, Phoebes. We see you. We follow you."*

"What", I asked,  only barely hearing what he'd just said. Because of this, and because of the fact that I was just so confused and emotionally drained by that point, I kept looking around trying to find him. "Howard, baby, where are you? can you still see me?"

*"I always see you, Phoebes. We all do."*

"What're you talking about?! Who?!" That's when, from the other end, I heard the screeching sound again. This time, though, it was less of a simple screeching sound, it sounded more like a bunch of people were all screaming at the top of their lungs, all at the same time into the receiver. Then, almost just as suddenly, the static clouded over the screaming before the call disconnected itself. After this, the screen went dark again, not turning back on.

My head was spinning. My heart felt less than two seconds from bursting straight out of my chest. *"WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?!"*

How was my phone still ringing after getting shattered?! How was I hearing the voice of my late husband?! Hell, *WHY* was I hearing his voice?! Then, of course, the most chilling, as well as the most mind-fucking question out of all of these; What was he talking about when he said that he could see me, that "He's always following me"? Who (or *what*) were the others he kept going on about that were also apparently "watching me"?

I was barely able to regain myself enough to actually get into my car and drive home. The whole time, I couldn't help but dart my eyes in every direction, half expecting to somehow see Howard or *somebody,* watching me. It got to a point where I was losing concentration of the road and control of the car, swerving from one side of the lane to the other like a snake. It was only when a car blared it's horn furiously at me, swerving around me just in time to keep from getting caught in a head-on collision, that I managed to refocus long enough to make it back home safely. I almost forgot to even turn the car off before I was essentially throwing myself out of the car and scurrying inside like I was on the run from a psycho.

Inside, I locked every door and window (even nailing blankets and towels to the windows) before going into my room and huddling under my covers like I did when I was five and had nightmares. The rest of the day was spent like this, quivering in bed, locked in my house, and losing myself in the limitless, boundless sea of insanity that was the situation. Try as hard as I possibly might, I was utterly clueless when it came to coming up with an explanation that made any real sense to me.

Aside from The “Who”, I was more focused on the “Why” and “How” this person(s) was doing this to me. Like I’ve said before, I *was* mostly convinced at first that this was either a scammer or a hacker fucking with me. But then, why? I don’t make *that* much money (not enough to really gain any real profit from robbing me digitally anyway), and I’m not invested in any stocks or anything.

Not only that, but why was I apparently being spied on? And by whom? And then, there’s STILL the question of how the hell they managed to make a phone call work on a *BROKEN phone.* “Expert hacker” or not, there’s no way you’re gonna make *that* make any kind of sense to me.

The next thing I knew, funny enough actually, I fell asleep. I guess “falling asleep” isn’t entirely the right way to say it, though — maybe “shut down”. In any case, I was unconscious, and I was woke up to the sound of my phone ringing again. I started panicking, *”No, no, no, no... not again...”*

It was resting on my nightstand, still blaring my ringtone (or at least, a distorted mimicry of it; something else that I guess didn’t really register to me at the time).  I tried to ignore it, hoping that it would stop soon. But it didn’t.

It only got louder and louder, getting more and more distorted as it did until it didn’t even sound like a ringtone anymore. It devolved into a jumbled mess of shrill, head-splitting screeching; like someone had recorded the sound of nails across a chalkboard. That’s when I finally caved and quickly snatched my phone from my nightstand.

Just like before, through the cracks across the front, the phone read **”UNKNOWN”**. I answered and immediately shouted into the phone, “What do you want from me?!” Just like before, the static fuzz droned in the background. This time, the voice was of a little girl.

“We see you, Phoebe”, it said, giggling and even letting out a familiar sounding pig-snort. “It’s fun, watching you...” she giggled again, “It’s like we’re playing tag, just like when we were little...”

My heart was frozen. My tongue felt dry and swollen in my mouth. That was my little sister’s voice on the other end! *“But how?!”*

She died when I was fourteen, killed after running into the street after the ball she’d accidentally kicked into the neighbor’s yard. The car tried to stop, but by the time it saw my sister’s little body run out in the middle of the street, it was too late. “Abby”, I asked, shuddering.

She giggled, “We’re getting closer, big sis. We see you.”

“\*Who are you?! What do you want from me?!”

“*We’re coming, Phoebe*.” Her giggling then grew louder and louder, like it was getting closer and closer to the phone; To me. “*We see you! We’re following you!*”

“WHO ARE YOU”, I screamed. The sound only grew louder, distorting again into the mess of screaming. This time, before the phone shut itself off again, I could hear a mix of Abby’s, Howard’s and even other people who I knew to be long dead, like my mother and father, both having passed from cancer last year, all say in unison, “*We see you. We see you, and we’re coming, Phoebe...*”

That’s when the phone cut itself off again. I tried frantically to get it to turn back on. To try and make them come back so I could figure out what was going on; why they were calling me, HOW they were calling me, and what they meant by “we”. No matter what I tried or how hard I tried it, though, nothing would make it turn back on.

*”Of course it won’t turn back on”*, I thought to myself, *”It’s BROKEN!”* But this was then countered by the question of how then were the things that were happening, that’d *just* happened, happen?

*”I mean, I DID JUST hear that. All of that ACTUALLY happened, right? That was Abby’s voice, Howie’s voice, ma and dad’s voices... wasn’t it?”*

Feeling myself slipping straight down to rock bottom, I took a hammer from my garage and smashed the absolute shit out of my phone. Real or not, I figured no phone = no “unknown” calls. I was merciless with the hammer, whacking and whacking until my phone was nothing more than a pile of shattered plastic, glass, and circuits and copper wires.

I stood for a moment, out of breath, tightly clutching the hammer. *”Breathe, Phoebe. It’s all over.”* I was about to try for one last swing, just to make sure. Instead, I dropped the hammer and collapsed on my knees, laughing with relief. *”It’s all over!”*

Pulling myself together (after about another 10 minutes), I picked up and threw the shattered remains of the phone away. After that, I went through and took down all the blankets from the windows. I felt relieved; whatever it was that was going on, it was all over now. Everything was fine. I’d wake up the next day and enjoy my free weekend from work, laughing at how paranoid I was... *right?*

The next morning, around 8:00 a.m., I decided to go out to buy a new phone. Because the Verizon store where I lived in the city was only about a twenty minute walk from my house, plus, I figured I’d hit up the coffee shop after for brunch (my best friend is one of the baristas), I decided not to bother with the car. As I was walking down Farrow Ave. though, I saw a man coming towards me.

I noticed that he was striding, like he was in a hurry. I also noticed that his eyes were dead set on me. *” What the—“*

Before I could blink, he broke into a sprint and grabbed me by the shoulders. My body seized up in his arms. His eyes were wide and bulging. But was even weirder, even creepier, was that They were completely black! No irises, no pupils, *nothing*! His eyes were just two giant marbles that I could feel staring right through me.

“Who are you? What’re you doing?!” I struggled to get out of his hold. “Let me go, NOW!”

He opened his mouth and said in a hoarse, raspy hiss, “I’ve found you, Phoebe.”

“What?”

His eyes (somehow) went even wider and he said, “We’re free. And we’ve finally found you.”

“What’re you talking about”, I cried. I continued wiggling frantically in his arms. It was no good. His hands were bear traps, holding my arms tight.

“We’ve been watching you, Phoebe-cakes”, he hissed, this time somehow perfectly mimicking the voice I heard from Howard in the parking lot the previous day. I froze up again. “We’ve been let out, and now, we’ve found you. We finally have you.”

“W-*we?*” That’s when I saw three others start walking up from behind him. They all seemed to focus their gaze on one thing — me!

“The game’s up, Phoebes”, I heard one of them say before giggling childishly. The voice was that of a little girl, despite it coming out of a grown *man*! “We found you. You lose, hehe...”

“Who are you people”, I cried. The other three joined around the man holding me, all four of them smiling wolfishly at me.

“We’ve been following you, Phoebe. Now, you’ve let us free.” The man’s face dropped the deranged grinning to then scowl. “It was horrible where we were. Everything hurts, all the time. It never ended.”

The man on the right of him, using my dad’s voice, said, “We couldn’t take it anymore. We were trying to get out! And now, we’re free!”

“And now, we have you. We’ll be together again. All together, as a happy family again”, the one with Abby’s voice said, still giggling. My blood froze when I then watched the other three then begin to walk into each other, somehow fusing together while the man holding me tried to pull me inwards to join. I struggled vigorously before sending my knee straight into his gut, causing him and the others to double over in pain, having seemed to interrupt their fusion process.

I took off back home, hearing them giving chase behind me. I made it and immediately flew inside and locked the doors. I moved my bookcase from the living room to block off the door.

It wasn’t long before I heard them banging on the door. “Let us in, Phoebe...”

I didn’t move. I just sat, pressing my back against the bookcase, quivering and praying they weren’t strong enough to break down the door and the bookcase. For about twenty minutes (though it felt like hours), they continued hammering on the door. “Let us in. You can’t hide anymore, Phoebe. We found you.”

At one point, I thought I could feel the bookcase begin budging. My heart started thundering. *”Oh God, please... please don’t let them in!”*

Fortunately, only a few seconds later, the banging stopped. I pressed my ear close to the bookcase. Nothing. I just sat there for a moment, breathing heavily. *”A-Are they gone?”*

Slowly, I picked myself back up and walked cautiously to the window. No one was there. I hastily threw the curtains closed (and yes, I nailed the blankets over them again), before then wedging one of the kitchen chairs against the back door and scurrying into my bedroom again, where I am now, typing this out on my laptop.

I’m scared. I can’t leave the house. They’re out there, waiting for me.

I don’t know what they are, or where they came from, or how the hell they did what they did with the phone. But I’ve realized one thing, one thing that sends my heart into a frenzy. Whatever was going on before, I made a mistake by destroying the phone.

Somehow, it must’ve acted as a barrier. A door they couldn’t get through. But when I destroyed it, I must’ve opened that door. Now they’re free, able to take the form of whoever they want.

All I know besides that is that they’re not gonna stop until they have me. Until I’m a part of whatever the hell  kind of abomination they are. I don’t know what to do.

I can’t leave. They know where I am. They’ll be following me, and I won’t even know it...

*until they have me.*

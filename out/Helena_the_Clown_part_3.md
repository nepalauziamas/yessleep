For part 3, a deep breath and... Here we go.

&#x200B;

I  am sorry to kind of breaking the story of what Martha told me. A lot  have happened lately and, honestly, I find hard to put things together  in clear way. Things need to be clear when I express them, not just  pieces of puzzle patched with holes in them. I have started my own  research, already found more then I was expecting, but pieces are far  from making a clear, unified, picture. But I will do my best to  continue.

&#x200B;

After  the train has passed, Martha continued: ”Just the ghost train, nothing  to worry. I never heard someone to be harmed by it. Although never heard  someone trying to stand on the tracks or anything like that.” A few  second of silence. ”Would you like to meet Helena, if you want. She  comes out almost every night.” A few more seconds of silence. ”I think I  know where she stays. Where she sleeps, during the day.” Things were  getting interesting. ”Where?” I asked.

&#x200B;

”On  the (street name and number censored), close to here. My late friend  Niculina used to live there. I think she woke Helena up.” This was  getting interesting, but scarier. Yet, I wanted to continue. ”Niculina  was younger then me, about ten years younger. She was born in Tulcea  county, at the countryside, not like me, in Bucharest. I worked as an  accountant, she worked in a factory. But we were very much alike. Our  husbands were long gone, our children left the country, to work in  western Europe, for money. They retired there, big pensions, not like  ours, and they forgot about us here. There were some guys who helped us a  bit, we needed to pay them a bit...

&#x200B;

Anyway,  Niculina seem to have been fortunate. She needed some renovations, a  few months before her passing. She called the guys who helped us. They  dug up the basement, I do not remember if it was the basement or the  yard, somewhere, to fix the issue, whatever that was. They said they  discovered some sort of coffin, sealed with some symbols. One of them  wanted to open it, but it was late that day and they postponed it for  the next day. That next day Niculina told them their services will no  longer be required. They insisted, but they said it was fine.

&#x200B;

In  the next few days, all the signs of work in the ward were gone.  Niculina seemed changed, she looked paler, talked strange, she even  refuse to tell me what was going. I felt that she was lying, but I could  not get anything else from her. Yet, the yard seemed to look better,  like someone was taking good care of it. Niculina was already too old  and weak for that. Months passed, Niculina was seen less and less. We do  not know if whatever happened caused to pass away earlier, she had some  serious diabetes, that she kept untreated. I told her to take care of  her health, she refuse to listen....” Martha sobbed a little. Perhaps  she remembered her old friend. I think I know how she felt, I know how  it is to loose a relative due to lack of self care on health issues.

&#x200B;

”In  the last days, when the ambulance came to take to the hospital, some of  us entered the yard and the house. It looked very good, polished, like  someone helped her. But it was something about all, like something that  made us feel uneasy. She was gone, in three days after days. The cause  of death seemed obvious, her relatives locked away the house and the  yard. I guess they argue on inheritance or something, or perhaps they  need signatures from those of them who are out of the country for years,  I do not know.” Martha smiled a bit: ”I guess this will happen with my  home as well, after I will be gone.” A few seconds of silence. ”Anyway,  the house and the yard were, mostly, silent. Mostly, but not fully. At  night, some strange sounds were heard, some strange shadows were  visible. Police was called, nothing seemed wrong, relatives  investigated, things seemed mostly ok. Only that the inside seemed clean  and taken care of, like before.

&#x200B;

At  this time the blackouts of the street lights started. And soon, people  begin to see Helena in that dark. For a few months, this is how things  were. People say the house is haunted, perhaps that Niculina was a witch  or things like that. The rest is, I guess, well known to you. Niculina  had nothing witchy about her, at least no more then the small things  many old ladies had, small, cheap things. Nothing to cause something  really serious. I have my own ideas, young people do not know almost  anything of the past. No even many of the elders from here know them,  they moved in after the period when Helena was well known.”

&#x200B;

Martha  became quit, probably lost in her thoughts. Things were getting  stranger and stranger. A layer of the reality I kinda refused to see  revealed itself to me, right inside my everyday, comfortable reality. I  did not know if I wanted to go with all this, I felt like returning to  my life, alone on my apartment on the Hurmuzaki Square, where I was  alone, where nothing supernatural happen (at least I am not aware of  it), where undead doll-witches do not exist. To my boring, yet well-paid  work. But I realized this was my chance of escape. I was a prisoner and  did not knew it. Do I want to be see, to feel what most people refuse  to? Was I wiling to give my safety? I decided I was. I shall not risk  foolishly, I shall be very cautious on this unexplored territory, but I  will enter it.

&#x200B;

So  I have asked: ”Is there any particular hour when she comes out?” ”I do  not know. Pretty late. Perhaps she is cautious as well. Helena may  powerful, but I think she can still be brought down, somehow, one way or  the other. She is one being, people are many. She does not have all the  fame she had back in the day, and police may not get so easily get  intimidated by her as it was before World War II, when she had her  reign, so to say. Perhaps she is looking for a new place to move out.  People who know a thing or two about strigoi and moroi might take a  chance and pull a stake through her heart, one night. Or one day.  Fortunately for Helena, she does not behave like we know from our  forefathers that strigoi or moroi behave. And not many young people know  how to deal with them. I admit I was born, raised and lived in the  city, not in the countryside, where people knew much more of the  traditions.”

&#x200B;

One  note needs to be made. Western readers probably noticed the reference  to strigoi or strigoaica, and to moroi. Some of those terms were used in  western literature, movies or TV series. This means that, if heard them  before, you have a very distorted view of them, like some sort of  Hollywood vampire. Strigoi and moroi, in Romanian folklore, are undead  creatures, but pretty different from western vampires. Strigoi are more  wraith-like beings, spirits who raise from the grave to feed on the life  force, not on the blood of the living. And they raise as wraiths, their  un-decayed bodies remain in the grave. They are killed when their  bodies are exhumed and a stake is passed in their hearts, or when their  hearts are removed and destroyed. Moroi are, sometimes, equivalent of  strigoi, sometimes they seem be, in certain areas, a different type of  undead creature, perhaps a little less malevolent or a little less  dangerous.

&#x200B;

The  name ”strigoi” is related with the name ”striga” or ”strega”, that  meant evil witch in old Mediterranean cultures. The ”striga” of old feed  on the living, but it was not clear if she was alive or undead, or if  she was sometimes alive, sometimes undead. Romanian ”strigoi” is  sometimes considered a living person who is, consciously or  unconsciously a future undead ”strigoi”, who already feeds, consciously  or unconsciously, on the life force of the living. The verb ”striga” in  Romanian comes from those creatures, it means to scream, lately to  shout. It seemed, initially, it meant to scream of out fear, due to an  evil creature. The origin of the term ”striga” comes from ancient Greek  mythology, where an owl-like creature was present named ”stryx”, who fed  on the living. There are some recent sigthings in the Balkans to evil,  supernatural, owls, but I digress to much. Perhaps, if you want, we  shall talk some time on those as well.

&#x200B;

For  now, I can safely say Helena does not seem to be a strigoi or moroi.  She seems more similar to a western type of undead being, yet hard to  understand, at least by now. She is definitely undead, one way or the  other, I am sure of that, but exactly what she is I do not know. So, I  continued to ask Martha different things, like: ”You said something  about Helena being famous. And feared.”

&#x200B;

”Oh  yes. As years passed, she became more well known and feared. Police  knew her, even Siguranta (Romanian secret and political police before  World War II). Were they afraid? Or there was someone or something  keeping her back? Or something of both? I am not clear. Things were  covered up pretty well. That man, the Puppeteer, who seemed to have her  under his control, was a real strange man. He was alive, he was aging,  unlike Helena, that was visible. Yet, in a way, he seemed even stranger  then Helena herself. He came to Romania from Manchester, England, in the  late XIXth century. Initially he was not a showman, but he presented  himself like a healer, a practitioner of ”alternative medicine”. I do  not remember his name was Gordon Jameson, if I remember well. He became  very well know fast by rich people and nobility, some say that he even  reached the royal family. Most considered him a conman, both as healer,  then as a showman. But some say they noticed that he was capable of  strange things. What things, I do not know. Occult circles welcomed him.

&#x200B;

He was not the only English or British expat who lived on the time in  Romania. Ever since the 1848 Revolution there were several of them who  reached high circles, many of them seemed real friends of Romania, like  Maria Rosetti (born Mary Grant) or Effingham Grant. But this man was  stranger. I am sure he was a sorcerer of some kind, not just because of  what people said he did in his early days, but for all that happen  regarding Helena later on. He was protected from high level. What level  or by whom, I do not know.

&#x200B;

At  first, when Helena started to kill, there were only individuals. The  murders were brutal, somewhat clumsy. It looked very much like the work  of that distasteful man, Laie the Butcher. At first, before Helena  appeared, the Puppeteer seemed to have Laie as a friend or they  collaborated in a way. They continued for a while after Helena appeared.  You see, Laie was, officially, a butcher who was very skilled in making  some delicious sausages, who lived and worked in Obor. But people knew  he was doing some illegal things, from behind. In time, he became  himself more well known and feared, although he did not renounced with  work as a butcher. Some say he was responsible for some murders of  wealthy people, or people connected to other people, especially in  politics. It seems working with the Puppeteer helped me in his gangster  work. I do not know how much the Puppeteer payed him or how he did. When  he was drunk he slipped something like he was sick of doing the dirty  work for the Puppeteer, but that it still payed off and was not willing  to gave up of his collaboration with him, whatever it was. Some people  connected Laie with the disappearance of children, of beggars, of  prostitutes. I do not know whatever he was doing, I do not know if I  want to know.

&#x200B;

People know now of the two Rimaru serial killers, father  and son, who killed women in the 1960ties and 1970ties, but they were  really easy, really cheap if we compare them with Laie. At some point,  Laie was found dead, somebody electrocuted him on a power grid, the body  was severely burned, they managed to identify him using his dental  record. Whoever did that to him hated him very much and there were so  many people who did hate him to the sky and back again. Most of the  people from Obor, and not only, were relieved that that bastard was  gone. No other butcher made sausages or kebabs to be so delicious, but  it matter little to nothing, if we think of the great benefit of him  being gone.”

&#x200B;

”Laie  the Butcher”, I though. ”Where did I heard that name before?...” Then I  remembered. I have a friend, a dealer of antiquities. About a year ago,  he had in his hand some documents of the old branches, including the  butchers. He said about some mad butcher who left a dairy of ”flights of  a fancy psychopath”, that he sold it, but scanned some pages, he said  he would gave them to me, he knew I was interested in psychology. Such a  hipster... But I digress, I shall continue.

&#x200B;

”Very  interesting things, you told me.” I replied to Martha. ”Honestly, I  would to see Helena with my own eyes. Do you think that is a good idea?”  ”I do not know.” Martha replied. ”It is already dark, but Helena would  not come yet. You can wait here, although I would like to go to bed, I  can try to stay up.” ”That is alright, I drove here, my car is parked  close by, I think I call handle it. Thank you so much so everything.”

&#x200B;

I  left Martha and went to my car. I had to move it, I had to argue with  someone, parking is a nightmare in Bucharest. After I finished parking  the car in a different spot, I started walking for a while, I was  anxious so see where Martha believed Helena resided. It was pretty close  to the spot where the incident with Marcel happened. An old house, not  intact, with some modern kitschy modifications, the fence looked pretty  ugly, but practical. I could knock, although I considered pretty  unlikely Helena shall answer. I could have shouted for her, but would  have been silly and childish, of course. So, I went to my car, got in  and waited. The next day I would be at work, a sleepless night would not  help me, especially if I was going to succeed in seeing Helena, I may  be shaken by it badly. I could get a day off, I hoped it would not be  the case. And I fell asleep.

&#x200B;

I  woke up suddenly. Outside it was dark, the street lights were out. I  checked the phone fast, it was 2.12 am. My heart started beating  rapidly. I tried to find a position to be invisible or to look asleep.  Every second mattered. It seems I was not that brave to come out and  face whatever Helena was directly. So I waited. Will she come? Or she  already left? It did not knew. In about one minute, I heard the  footsteps. Like a woman walking in medium size heels with a walking  defect. As the sound came closer, a feeling of dread came over me. I  tried my best to look asleep, but kept a half of eye open. Then I so  her. Just as people described her.

&#x200B;

Little to nothing of her face was  visible, the dress was long and black, belle epoque style. (Probably  belle epoque casual style, not official event of ball style, I guess.)  She held the purse on her left shoulder, this time. The black hair was  kind of coarse, so to say, that type of hair that tends to be curly, but  only a little bit, not straight. ( I guess brushing and styling is  pretty hard, so glad I have straight hair. Sorry, I digress again. But  it is pretty interesting what thoughts can came to your head in  situations like this.) I was curious to see her face, but I was too  afraid, at least for now. Maybe next time. I did not want to engage with  this being I could not comprehend yet. So I waited for her to pass by.  She did turned her head towards my car, she sensed something, perhaps.  In the dark, some strange, distorted form of clown makeup seemed to be  on her face, but I was afraid to stare. Fortunately, she did not stopped  and moved on. I have waited in fear for the footsteps to disappear,  then the lights went on. I have gathered myself to drive out. When I  reached home, I went to bed without undressing and fell asleep. I was  late for work, but that is another story. For now, Ruxandra is out.

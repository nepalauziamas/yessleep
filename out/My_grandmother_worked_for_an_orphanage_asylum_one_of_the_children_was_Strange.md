My grandmother worked for an orphanage asylum back in the 1930’s. She passed away recently, but, this is a story she told me shortly before her death:

There are none more vulnerable souls than those of stray children, and so it was that as a young woman I was sent by the church to St. Kathrine’s Orphan Asylum on missionary assignment. The year in which I was sent had been a particularly troubled year. Many crops had failed in the summer and the winter was no better. It set in with a bitter cold and drew on, long and dark, for months. The economy slowed to a crawl and families struggled to survive. It’s no wonder really, that there were so many orphans during this time. 

As it were, St. Katherine’s was quite some ways out in the country. I think that was done on purpose in hopes that we wouldn’t get quite so many abandoned children. However the distance helped none at all. Children would come walking up the great dirt driveway to our doorsteps with little more than the clothes on their backs. 

The home itself was that of a mansion once owned by an esteemed nobleman until his untimely death quite some years prior. It consisted of twelve rooms and ample living spaces. Most children were well mannered, and any who were not Sister Beatrice would discipline accordingly. We, like many others, struggled to feed and clothe all the children. St. Kathrine’s was at capacity, yet more children kept arriving. 

I wrote to the church several times for help, only to receive no answer. The situation was becoming increasingly desperate when a shiny black automobile made it’s way up our long driveway. It rattled as it went, and seemed to bring a shadow across the land with it. It had thin white rimmed tires and the cabin of the thing was large with black curtains blocking off any view one might hope to have of the inside.  

It approach with no great urgency and finally came to a stop with gravel crunching under the wheels.  The fellow driving stepped out. He was tall and slim. Both his skin and clothing were dark. So dark in fact, that it seemed as though no light touched this person at all, he could have been a shadow for all the tangibility he seemed to have. He was dressed in an expensive valet suit, he wore a vacant expression and moved fluidly to open the rear passenger door of the vehicle. 

The valet then waited without getting back into the car, standing as still as a statue beside the passenger door. There was a moment of suspense before a second man stepped out. This man was almost as unusual as the first. He was young and handsome. He dressed in fine clothes with rings of all colour decorating his fingers. His hair was a light ash blonde, while his skin was slightly tanned. He made his way over to the Sisters and I, and gave a polite bow. 

“I beg your pardon Sisters, I am Doctor Small from the Dunkel Institute of Psychiatry. Might I speak to the gentleman of this establishment?” He asked with authority. His voice was smooth and it was only then that I noticed his eyes. They were lime green under long white lashes. I may have been sworn to virtue, but I would be lying if I said my heart didn’t race then.  

I couldn’t be sure if he had the same effect on the other Sisters. However, I noticed that Sister Beatrice seemed to pay him particularly close attention, though it was Mother Superior Ruth who spoke, “I am the warden of this Orphanage. Whatever your business you may speak with me.” she spoke evenly. 

“Very well. I have word that your organisation is facing some financial difficulties, I have a proposal to remedy that. May we speak in private?” He spoke to Mother Ruth directly and she nodded in agreement. Initially she invited him into the office of the house, but he refused. Stating that they should speak in the privacy of his vehicle instead. 

Of course I found this odd, what conversation was so important he couldn’t trust the house? Manners prevented me from asking and I wasn’t privy to the discussions. However, when Mother Ruth left the automobile she did so by throwing the door open and herself out.  

She watched the man go with malice, her arms folded tight across her chest and her jaw set firm. The man returned  her expression of contempt with a knowing smile and a polite tip of his hat, “When you change your mind, and decide to accept my generous offer, you only need send a letter.” 

“What did he propose?”, I asked the moment his vehicle departed, it drove off with no more rush than it had arrived with. Driving slow and purposeful on the gravel as it rolled away.

“He is a man of the devil. No offer he makes is one we can accept.” She hissed, though never did elaborate despite my attempts. 

After that day food deliveries became even more unreliable, we received no donations of clothing or money. It became so desperate that Sister Mary and I had to travel into town personally for supplies. We served the children only a single can of beans between them that night, for no merchant had anything to sell us. Of course we pleaded with the church for assistance, but still no reply came. 

To make matters worse, the following day Sister Mary ran down the stairs in a fluster. Tears streaming down her face. She had found the Mother Superior deceased in her bed. There seemed to be no good reason for it. It was just another misfortune that we endured. We were isolated and without leadership. 

In desperation the remaining five of us gathered to discuss all options. None were good. We sent Sister Rose away to personally reach the church. The journey would take some weeks, but as no letters were arriving that was the option we had left. However, we came to realise we would need help sooner than that, as without immediate assistance we would have to close the orphanage.. It was at this time that we turned to Sister Beatrice for guidance as she was intended to be the next Mother Superior among us.

She wrote to the strange Doctor. I dared not ask what the terms were. It was an unspoken agreement among us that we would not utter a word about it. However, on the night the cursed letter was sent, one child vanished from our home and the following morning, a wagon of food pulled into our driveway.

This exchange would happen but once a month, on the first Tuesday of each. We began to call the disappearances, ‘silent adoptions’ and I tried not to think about where those children went or what became of them. One thing I was never sure of was how the children were chosen. Was it at random? Or was Sister Beatrice making choices? I never dared ask. 

I knew this was perhaps a mistake. We should have allowed the orphanage to close. For once we accepted the deal the man would appear every so often to make additional demands. He would stalk the grounds as if he were on a pleasant stroll. He spoke with the children, laughing and smiling with them, offering them candy. Sometimes he even participated in races with the children. 

Then he would approach and suggest something that he wanted to see changed. At first, this demands seemed helpful. He demanded the children have better clothing, and so new clothes arrived for them. Not donated clothing riddled with holes and lice as I had come to expect, but rather, brand new clothes well suited to each individual child. 

Next he demanded the children partake in extra classes. In addition to their grammar, mathematics and spelling, they were expected to partake in sports training of sorts. Running, swimming and archery at first. Which then expanded into strategy theory and rudimentary weapons training, taught by a hand selected professionals associated with the Doctor. 

Personally I couldn’t see why such training would be necessary. It’s not as though knowing how to kill a straw man with a wooden sword would make a child more adoptable. However, this became our new normal. Regular food wagons, grand new clothing, strange lessons and stranger additional staff. All bought our silence whenever a child disappeared. After all, one ought not look a gift horse in the mouth. 

The day I had been dreading for reasons I can’t fully explain came as fall began. You see, each of us had our own favourite orphans, and made efforts on those children’s behalf to keep them from the Doctor as best we could. For example, we would ban them from walking outside while the Doctor would visit under the pretence of a punishment. While truthfully it was because we noticed children the Doctor spent the most time with on his visits were the ones that were most likely to vanish. 

It’s far easier to accept the loss of a child that you don’t particularly care for and it’s hard not to get attached. The child I most delighted in was Eric. Eric had come to us  in the strangest of ways. The night he arrived it was thundering outside, no one noticed him on our doorstep until the night rounds were completed and by then he was soaked through. Shivering like a leaf he sat curled over on himself, rain dripped from his dark hair and his eyes were focused unwaveringly out into the storm. 

He was only 8-years-old, with him he had a suitcase, leg brace, and a letter. This was curious as most arrived with nothing. He did not speak a single word for three days and the other sisters feared he was simple. However, I knew this wasn’t the case for he followed instruction and behaved accordingly. The first time he spoke, it was to ask for a bread roll. 

For a majority of the time he was confined to a wheelchair. He was affected by the polio disease and so when he stood his left leg needed a brace to walk any distance at all. Other children kept away from him fearing they would catch his illness and it was because of this that I made an effort to keep him company. 

He was a bright child and hated being confined to the wheelchair. I lost count of the times I would find him laying helplessly on the floor as he had tried to walk unassisted. So it shouldn’t have surprised me to find him outside one day, his wheel chair rolled into the grass and stuck. 

Unfortunately, I had noticed him too late, and it was with horror that I watched the Doctor cross the yard to speak with him. When I arrived The Doctor had crouched down to be at eye level with Eric and they were speaking casually. 

“I’m going to climb that tree.” Eric explained to the man. Of course he was referring to the tree ahead of him and I realised his wheels had become tangled as he was trying to reach the tree. 

“Oh?  You cannot possibly with that leg of yours.” The Doctor responded bemused, he reminded me of a cat toying with an injured bird. 

Eric scowled, “What do you know?”  He asked agitated, this was the tone of voice Eric often had whenever other children would tease him. 

“Do you truly believe you can do it?” The man asked with genuine interest. 

“I will climb it.” The child retorted. 

I interrupted them there, “Doctor, you must forgive me, this is Eric, his manners are not well refined.” I addressed the man first, then Eric, “And young man, you should be inside.” I scolded him. I felt contempt boiling in me for this man and the way he was regarding Eric with such interest.   

The Doctor’s eyes move to me and he spoke, “That’s quite alright, this child is afflicted?” He asked. 

“By the disease polio.” I confirmed. 

“He is unable to move his left leg, and his right arm seems to be weak yes?” The doctor asked. 

I just nodded, already moving to wheel Eric away. 

“Why does he believe he can climb a tree?” The Doctor continued as he followed us. 

“Because he see’s other children climb it often.” I replied, the doctor had never set foot into the building and I was worried that this time might be the exception. 

“So he is touched in the head?” 

“I’m not touched in the head!” Eric answered annoyed. 

“It is impossible for you. You are too weak.” The man responded informally. 

I heard Eric draw a sharp breath as though to argue and so I warned him, “Do not answer back to your elders.” I said sternly praying the boy would understand I didn’t want him to speak with the Doctor any further. 

Eric let out the breath slowly, “I’m not weak.” He whispered so softly I almost couldn’t hear it. I cannot say for certain whether or not the Doctor heard it for he said nothing more. He seemed to lose interest and turn away. Choosing instead to join an archery lesson in progress with a couple of the older boys. 

Relief washed over me as I crossed the threshold inside, the wheels on Eric’s chair rattled over the floorboards leaving mud that I would later have to clean, but I didn’t mind. “I’ve told you not to go outside, why were you out there?” I demanded of the child. 

“All the other children are allowed outside.. It’s not fair..” He murmured 

“Be that as it may, you must remain inside. And you especially must not speak to that man.” I told him firmly. Eric refused to answer me then, I knew I had upset him. However he was better off unhappy, than disappeared. 

In the days following, I saw the Doctor speak to many other children and my fear that he would be taken next began to subside. It is perhaps a show of my true character to say that I was relieved that some other child may be chosen, so long as it wasn’t Eric. However, as I watched the children playing the Doctor made his way over to me. 

“Sister, I don’t believe we have been formally introduced. My name is Dr. Small from the Dunkel Institute of Psychiatry.  Would you do me the honour of accompanying me on a walk?” He inquired.

In response I smiled politely as a young woman was expected to and he offered me his hand to help me stand. I gathered my skirts and accepted his assistance with reluctance. I remember his hand being so cold that I startled. No living thing should have been so cold. Yet he seemed amused, as if I was the punchline to some kind of private joke with himself.

“Tell me Sister, the afflicted child, I haven’t seen him in the yard of late. Where might he be?” Dr. Small asked as we walked. 

“We have several children with afflictions, which do you mean?” I asked knowing full well who he was asking after. 

“I believe you said his name was Eric. I can’t imagine many families would be willing to adopt a child cursed with disease. So I’m sure he’s still here.” The man spoke knowingly and I began to feel a distinct unease. As far as I had known he had never before asked about any specific child.

“As he is afflicted, he is unable to play outside with the other children.” I answered shortly, hoping to convey a lack of interest.

“Does he take the same lessons as the others?” Dr. Small continued.

“He is unable to participate in physical activities.” I reiterated.

“I would very much like to speak with him again. Will you arrange it? Or need I speak to Sister Beatrice?” He spoke with an aloof demeanour, but only a fool would miss the intent behind his words. 

“If you wanted to speak with him, you will have to do so indoors. The outside world is challenging to him.” I had hope that setting a meeting inside the house would deter the ‘good’ Doctor and for a second I thought it had worked, for he hesitated a moment before answering.  

“Very well, I will meet with him tomorrow.” He informed before taking his leave. He was gone with such abruptness that I wondered briefly if he were a street cat in a past life. Then my worries turned to Eric. I had heard that some men prefer little boys to grown woman, and it worried me to think that Doctor Small’s interest might indicate such a fancy. I failed to imagine at the time that anything could be worse than that, and I was wrong. 

I spent the morning of the following day preparing Eric, “Speak only when spoken to, answer questions with as little information as possible and do NOT go anywhere with him. Do you understand me?” I told him, praying the boy would listen. He almost never listened to instructions. 

“Okay okay.” Eric dismissed me, “Why does he want to talk to me anyway?” 

“I don’t entirely know..” I admitted, “Wait here, and I will go get him.” 

I nervously adjusted the collar of Eric’s shirt for perhaps the hundredth time, before departing to meet Dr. Small. The man stood leaning against his spotless black car as if he had been waiting for some time, and I hoped that I had kept him waiting. His driver, as always, stood beside him motionless and made no indication that he noticed my approach. 

I offered a false apology to the Doctor for his wait as I lead him through the front doorway of the house into the entryway room. I half expected that the Doctor wouldn’t follow. Unfortunately he did. He stepped over the threshold into the house without any hesitance and I wondered what previous trepidation he may have had. 

When we entered several of the orphans ran to greet Dr. Small. He was well received among the other children and I didn’t want Eric to like him as well. The man stopped briefly to offer the children a strange wrapped candy. 

“They aren’t allowed sweets.” I protested but the Doctor ignored me, handing out the lollies liberally from his pockets. 

“They’re allowed these, just as a treat.” He smiled at the kids as they pushed each other aside to be the first ones to take the treats. 

I was about to protest further when the sound of straining squeaky metal caught my attention. I looked up to see Eric standing supported by his cane and wearing his metal leg brace. 

“You were supposed to wait upstairs!” I exclaimed. 

“Why? I can walk.” He stated defiantly, though the sweat on his brow betrayed the effort it had taken him to even get this far. 

“So you can.” Dr. Small acknowledged, waving the others away so that he could approach Eric, “Will you walk with me then child?” 

“He can’t walk long distances.” I interjected, but the Doctor put up a hand as if to silence me. 

“He seems eager, why disturb his mind with such negative notions?” 

“I can walk long distances.” Eric insisted. 

“Excellent, perhaps you can show me around the manner?” Dr. Small smiled encouragingly. Children cannot tell when adults are lying, they don’t notice when the smile doesn’t reach the eyes or when the words encourage cruelty. But I can. And I will never forget the gleam in that man’s eye as Eric struggled to walk, it was a torture disguised as a pleasantry. 

Of course I followed after them. Eric navigated with effort through each room, chattering about our daily routines, showing off anything he thought might be of interest to the Doctor. All the while, Dr. Small watched him, analysing each step the boy took. Waiting eagerly to see if he would fall or not when as Eric struggled to place the cane and heave his stiff leg around. 

“Perhaps we should allow him a time to rest.” I offered when we reached the dinning room, though I knew it was an effort in vain. Eric was trying to prove that he wasn’t weak to this man, I could see the fire of determination burning in his crystal blue eyes. 

“I Don’t.. need. A.. rest.” He huffed, breathless from the effort. 

“What about me? Perhaps I need a rest?” Dr. Small mused, catching both Eric and I by surprise, “Come, let’s sit.”  He insisted.

I pulled out a chair for Eric and he reluctantly sat in it, though I could see he was grateful for the break. 

“Might I speak with Eric alone.” The Doctor asked, though it sounded more as though it were an instruction. 

“You might not.” I answered. 

“Very well.” He sighed, then focused his attention back to my child, “Eric, how is your leg?” 

“It’s fine.” He muttered, “I can walk more.” He insisted 

“There’s no need for that. We’ve walked quite far enough for one day.“ Dr. Small assured then leant in closer to Eric, speaking so softly that I’m not entirely sure what was said. I thought however that I heard him say, ‘You know Eric, I’m a doctor and I can fix that leg for you, if you have the will for it..’ 

The surprise on Eric’s face is what convinced me over the years that I was correct in my assumption, “Keep trying to climb that tree. I will come see you again tomorrow, we will talk more of it then.” Dr. Small told him before checking his watch, “It was delightful to spend time with you both. But I must be going now. Sister, I believe another ‘adoption’ will take place tonight? Who do you believe most ‘deserves’ to be adopted?”  He spoke to me now, his expression smug. 

“I couldn’t say. All children are deserving of loving homes.” I replied neutrally. However, I couldn’t help but feel as though he had in some way, threatened Eric’s safety. 

“I couldn’t agree more.” The Doctor concurred, “I should like to spend some time alone with Eric tomorrow. If that is too difficult, I’ll simply have to adopt him.” 

That time the threat wasn’t subtle, “You are welcome to adopt him, every child deserves a good home.” I stated through my teeth, “However, should you not be ready to make such decisions on a whim, I will of course allow for you to see him in private tomorrow.”

With this answer the Doctor seemed satisfied and I moved to Eric’s side swiftly, placing a hand on his shoulder as if that would somehow deter this man from deciding to take him. 

“I’ll see you tomorrow then.” He spoke directly to Eric before departing. 

Sleep never came to me that night. I spent it walking the hallways with a lamp in hand. Checking in on all the children repeatedly, but especially, on Eric. It was never a certain arrangement on when the child would be taken. The other Sisters and I would settle everyone into bed, and in the morning without fail, one would be missing. I was determined that it would at the very least, Not be Eric. 

The floorboards creaked softly under my bare feet as I walked, the hallway clock ticked back and forth rhythmically, and the lantern illuminated the area before me in a weak circle of flickering light. Quietly I turned each door handle, the metal latches released with a hushed ‘click’ that seemed horrifically loud, but none of the children awoke as I peaked in.  Some hours passed this way and I began to consider that perhaps no ‘silent adoption’ would take place this night after all. 

As the hour grew long and nothing seemed out of place, I decided that I would at least try to find some time to rest. I made my final rounds and began walking back down the hallway towards my room. This is when I felt that something had changed. The clock had stopped ticking, allowing a heavy silence to settle in the air and the darkness of the house seemed thicker somehow. 

It’s difficult to describe the feeling of such dread that came over me, it was as if something evil had infiltrated the walls and was leaking a poison into the atmosphere. My heart began to race and I hurried back to Eric’s room. His room was not all that much further down the hall and it didn’t take me long to return to it. 

To my relief, he was still sleeping, tucked away safely just as he was when I last saw.  His bed was the lower bunk of two in the room. Moonlight shone in strongly through the window, glinting off the metal on his leg brace which was propped beside his bed. I glared long and hard into that room to make sure nothing was out of place. 

However, it was as I turned away, quietly shutting the door to his room, that I noticed it. I held my lamp up higher, unsure of what I had seen, my heart began to thunder in my chest. Something was standing further down the hallway, appearing to be not more than a tall shadow in the darkness, “Sister?” I called optimistically to no reply. 

“H-have you come to check on the children as well?” I called, the fear in my voice betraying my pretence. I knew already that this was no one familiar. As I watched the mass moved, it stepped slowly as a person would and it seemed to be dragging something behind it.

With shock I realised it were holding a child by the leg, I recognised her, Latasha was her name. The sight was horrid. The girl seemed to be broken, her limbs twisted in an unnatural way but her body seemed limp for she put up no fight at all. Her eyes wide open but glossed over white, her hair trailed behind her brushing the floor as the thing dragged her without any care across the slats.

I said a quiet prayer, I was certain that I was in the presence of a demon and it is my greatest shame that I did not act on that day. Instead I stood frozen with fear as it carried her away. My hands trembled and I very nearly dropped the lamp. When at last I regained control of my senses I rushed to the bedroom from which it had come. 

The door to the room was ajar, however, the other children inside remained soundly asleep. Only the one bed were empty with bedsheets a tangled mess. Immediately I went to Sister Beatrice’s chambers. I demanded answers, for surely she knew of this. I was certain that she must have known the price of the deal she had made with the Doctor. 

Upon speaking with her my suspicions were confirmed for she refused me admittance. Ordering that I return to my own room and speak no more of anything I ‘thought I saw’. I knew then that I would receive no help from her. She had turned her back on the faith in favour of darkness. 

I was reminded then, that Sister Beatrice was always somewhat brutish in nature. Often quick to a temper and quicker still to punish any child whom she believed disobeyed her order. Sister Rose never returned in all the weeks since she had left and so I wrote to the church once more pleading for help. I sent the letter off with the post that very morning without telling Sister Beatrice.

\*\*\*

At breakfast Sister Beatrice announced that Latasha had been ‘adopted’. I could feel her gaze on me willing me to be silent and I was. I focused instead on fixing children’s clothes, tying shoe laces and feeding the youngest among them. The decision to ask for outside help without her permission was already made. Now I only had to keep my head down. I began to pray morning and night. In secret I blessed the hallways, cleansing the air with sage. Nothing seemed to help. 

When Doctor Small arrived in his shiny black car I knew he would ask for Eric. For this reason I allowed Eric outside. I didn’t want the Doctor alone with Eric where no one could watch over and I made sure to stay near by. He spoke to Eric for hours. The boy sat in his wheel chair beneath the big tree and the Doctor sat on the grass in front of him. It almost looked as though they were father and son, reunited after years and I couldn’t help but feel sick that that was an easy assumption to make. 

Doctor Small finally left when the children were called inside for lunch and I approached Eric immediately. 

“What did he talk with you about?” I asked him. 

Eric shrugged, “I don’t know, a lot of things.” He answered vaguely and I wondered if he was being purposefully unhelpful. 

“Did he ask you anything.. funny?” I struggled to word my question so as not to sound too concerned. 

“No? Funny like what? He asked about my leg a lot, and my arm. He says he can fix them, make me walk again.” He said nonchalantly but I could see the hope in his eyes. 

“Eric-..” I started, I didn’t quite know how to explain to him that the Doctor was most likely lying but he interrupted me. 

“I know everyone say’s it’s impossible, Dr. Small is probably lying, but I don’t care. Maybe I can teach myself to walk again on my own.” He stated, catching me by surprise. He was intuitive, and that intelligence was matched only by the determination of his will. I stared at him dumbfounded for a moment and that’s when I noticed the subtle bruising on his arms just below the cuff of his shirt. 

With a frown of confusion I lifted his sleeve to get a better look. It was an angry red bruise in the shape of a small hand. Someone had grabbed him hard. I tried to think back to his time with the Doctor, the man had never laid a hand on him and the fingers on the bruise were too small. Had the other children been hurting him? 

“Who grabbed you?” I demanded as Eric pulled away from me sharply. 

“No one.” He answered a little too quickly, “Can I go eat now?” Eric wheeled his chair away from me without asking permission and I allowed him to go. 

From that day forward I took more notice. Eric’s new clothes would often have scuff marks and there were a handful of times I overheard the other children mention his name, though when I passed by they quietened down. I suspected they were bullying him in private, although I could never catch them in the act and Eric refused to speak to me about it. 

Months passed. The silent adoptions continued, I saw the shadow creature far too many times for it to have been a figment of my imagination and still there was no word from the church. Doctor Small would visit each day and spend great amounts of time with Eric. They spoke at length, often the man would insist Eric try to walk and occasionally he would even encourage him to participate in the outdoor classes that other children took. 

It’s hard to admit, but the boy became quite accurate with a bow. I had previously insisted that he should not join any of the sports because of his condition. The Doctor however, was persistent that he should be treated as any other child would be. In some ways it was cruel. Eric would never be as capable as the others and watching him fail only opened him up to further ridicule. But.. Perhaps that was wrong of me to assume that the boy didn’t want to at least try. 

After all, Eric was a particularly spirited child. His attitude toward almost anything was one of unwavering determination, even to a detriment. I began to notice after some weeks that he wasn’t sleeping or eating as well as he should have been. This seemed to sour his mood and he became quicker to anger than he ever was before. 

What I mean to say is that Eric was always an angry child. His limitations frustrated him. Families who came to adopt over looked him because of his additional care requirements and he wasn’t able to play or run freely with the other children. I believe that to some extend, he was even angry to be at St. Kathrine’s. Perhaps he blamed his parents for leaving him behind. 

I was beginning to suspect that the Doctor was stoking this flame, encouraging Eric to anger where I would have preached acceptance. Often now the boy would leave his chair behind in favour of the leg brace only to curse himself when he fell. Until then I didn’t know he even knew such language. Of course I tried to speak with him about it but he refused my attempts regardless of the approach I took. I became certain that Dr. Small was infecting Eric, encouraging an unnatural hatred in him.

As winter set in and the snow began to fall the orphanage, for the first time, ran low on children. The holiday season always brings about more adoptions and more donations. Families feel inclined to generosity or more lonely when thinking of family, especially in relation to orphans and this seemed to have a greater impact on Eric more than the others. It highlighted how unwanted he was I suppose…

And so it was, that one day I came down stairs to find Eric missing from the table. My heart stopped a moment as I tried to remember which day of the month it was, had he been ‘adopted’ during the night? It wasn’t the right time, it was nearly the middle of December. It wasn’t possible, I convinced myself, hurrying instead to check his room. 

It was empty his bed made, I felt fear creeping into my veins, perhaps the schedule had changed, I thought. Then out the window I spotted something in the tree. In disbelief I peered out, it was Eric. He appeared to be at least half asleep high in the branches, his brace left at the base of the tree covered with ice crystals. 

In horror I rushed out to him, I had to make use of a ladder to collect him and when I reached him he was cold to the touch. His lips pale and ice crystals coated his eyelashes. I realised then that he wasn’t merely sleeping, he was shivering violently and nearly unconscious. I couldn’t imagine how long he must’ve been out there.  

“Eric. Eric, wake up.” I shook him though he hardly responded. 

“Tell.. The Doctor he was wrong.. I did it..” He murmured. 

“Never mind about him now. Foolish child.” I scolded, though in truth I was relieved. I had only wrapped him in my coat as I carried him inside but the color was already returning to his cheeks. It seemed he hadn’t been outside as long as I had first feared. 

I placed him in front of the fire, wrapped him in blankets and prepared him a warm beverage, “Drink slowly.” I warned him, “What in the heavens were you doing out there?”

“Climbing.. “ he answered meekly, “I’ve been practicing every night. I knew I would get it..”  

There was nothing I could say. If I hadn’t personally seen him in the tree I would never have believed a crippled boy could do it. I thought back to all the times he had tried to walk with the brace instead of using the chair, perhaps his leg truely could be healed. 

The Doctor never did show up that day. Nor did he show up at all for the following week. I felt my hatred for the man grow, he had visited every day prior. Though now that Eric had gone to such lengths to prove his worth Dr. Small failed to arrive. Eric asked after him every day, insisting that he was strong and that the Doctor had to acknowledge that. 

To make matters worse, it seemed being in the cold did the boy no favours. He fell ill and the sickness took it’s toll. By the weeks end I had called in a local doctor to tend to him. Eric had influenza and by the time the doctor was able to see him it had developed into pneumonia. I was told the prognosis was severe. He was unlikely to survive. 

I stayed by his side for days, listening as his breathing deteriorated. His little breaths became ragged and laboured. He coughed night and day, sometimes spitting up unsavoury chunks of phlegm. I knew then that he would die for certain, though I did my best to remain positive for his sake. 

It was Christmas Eve when Dr. Small’s vehicle next pulled into our drive, obnoxious and loud, I left Eric and I stormed outside. “You vile devil worshiping swine.” I spat. This took the man by surprise and I saw an expression of genuine shock cross his smug face. 

“Now now Sister, there’s no need for name calling. Tell me, where is Eric?” He asked recovering annoyingly quick.

“Inside. Dying because of you.” I snapped. 

“Because of me? Pray tell, what exactly do you believe I’ve done to him?” Dr. Small asked exasperated, he stood slightly taller then, looking down his nose at me. 

“He climbed that damned tree in the middle of the night and now will die of pneumonia.” 

The man shrugged, “And did he manage to climb it?” He asked. 

For a moment I hesitated, I wanted to lie, to give him no satisfaction, “He did. Despite whatever hateful doubts you fed him.” 

“Interesting.” Dr. Small smiled, then without invitation, proceeded to enter the house. Presumably in search of Eric. I followed after him, I hadn’t expected him to know where Eric was. Since we had to move him into isolation to keep the other children from becoming sick, though the man made no mistake in his direction. 

When we entered the room Eric seemed worse than when I had left him. He looked even more frail now, each time he coughed it seemed to come right from his toes and rattle his entire skeleton on the way up. I looked over to The Doctor to make my point but the man stood as still as stone. 

His expression odd, no longer the arrogant smug man I had come to know. Instead he wore no expression at all, his emotions carefully guarded I thought, “Eric.” He spoke with authority and the boy opened his eyes. 

“..I did it..” Eric responded, with shallow breaths as he tried to sit up for the Doctor but the man pushed him back down immediately. He placed his fingertips on Eric’s chest for a brief moment and… I thought.. I thought I saw a glow. Of course I can’t be certain, it was very quick, perhaps a glint of light from the window. The Doctor was turned away from me and he continued as if nothing had happened.

“Stay down, you need to rest. I heard you climbed the tree. So what are you doing now? You plan to die here?” The man demanded and I saw the tiniest spark of rage ignite in Eric’s eyes as the man continued, “Poor little cripple. Too weak to combat an illness such as this? You’re a disappointment.” He stated bluntly before turning on his heels to leave. 

At this Eric struggled to sit up again while I stood speechless. Of all the things I had possibly expected Dr. Small to say, that was, most definitely, not it. The man walked past me without a word back to his car and once I recovered from my own disbelieve I hurried after him. 

“Now wait just a minute! You need to go back and apologise to that boy Right Now!” I shouted flustered. 

“There’s no point, he will be dead by morning.” The man responded coldly. 

“And you want those to be the last words he hears?” I demanded.

“The last words a dead child hears are of no consequence. There’s nothing more that can be done for him, but if he has the will for it and lives through the night they won’t be the last words he hears. Don’t you agree?” He snapped back and I was surprised to find myself afraid. I realised then that there was a an anger that burned in this man, like the temper of one who would strike his wife.

“You are a godless, vile man.” I stated in a low tone. 

“Is that so? And just what has ‘God’ ever done for you? Why don’t you go write another letter to the church to complain. See how far it gets.” He retorted and to my surprise, pulled a letter from his coat which he tossed back at me. It fell to the ground as he got into his vehicle. I stared at that letter dumbfounded as he drove off, I recognised the handwriting on the envelope. It was my own print, the letter was the very one I had sent to the church the night I had first seen the shadow. 

I understood a great many things in that moment. The church had never responded because they had never gotten any word from us. Our establishment was cursed from the first day Dr. Small darkened our doorways. I wondered how far his influence reached, had he stopped towns folk from trading with us? Had he forced Sister Beatrice’s hand in agreeing to his proposal? 

After picking up the letter and gathering my thoughts I returned to Eric’s side. His fever had worsened, looking at him I knew that Dr. Small was correct. He wouldn’t survive the night. For hours I sat with him, dabbing his forehead and praying for his recovery.

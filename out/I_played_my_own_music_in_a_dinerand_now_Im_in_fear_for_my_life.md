I live in a rural town just south of Boston, and there’s a very small kinda dive diner right nearby my house that I’ve been going to ever since I can remember. It’s called simply “Jimmy’s” and they stay open until about 1:00 in the morning.

Me and my buddies always go there for some wings after a long night of drinking, and have been for a long time. The owner, who’s nicknamed “Jukebox Jimmy” always give us a free first set of wings, as long as we offer to pay 25 cents to play a song on his jukebox, to which we always happily oblige.

However, the other night I played a new Slipknot song for my buddy while we were eating our wings from Spotify on my phone. It wasn’t too loud at all because nobody wants to be “that” guy at a restaurant. After it was over we asked Jimmy for our classic set of wings, to which he grunted and went into the kitchen. My friend and I looked at each other and assumed Jimmy must’ve been having a rough day, so we went up to the jukebox to play our 25 cent song. As I put the quarter in the machine, Jimmy yelled from across the room;

“Of course, now that your little device is done playing that shit music, you wanna play real music”.

I had to take a minute to recognize what he had just said to me. I said back 

“Excuse me? I was showing my friend a song…”

Jimmy looked almost insulted and gritted his teeth. He threw our wings on the ground and yelled;

“Get the fuck out of my diner…that jukebox is all I have left and you guys just throw it to the side and prefer to use your little mobile audio players…I’m sick of it.”

Of course at this point me and my friend are hauling ass out of there, but we just didn’t understand why an old man cared so much about his jukebox. So we decided that we just wouldn’t go back and that should’ve been it.

Yet…it wasn’t even close to over. That night we got in my car, smoked a bowl together, and decided to head home. As I was driving my friend back home, this old Lincoln with its bumper hanging half off the front started following us. Soon after…we heard what felt like little pellets being thrown at my car, so we pulled over to the side of the road and the Lincoln just zoomed past us.

At this point, I’m thinking there was rocks in the road or something like that. But, we noticed in the middle of the road, there was quarters everywhere. The guy in the Lincoln was throwing quarters at us, and we knew it must have been Jimmy. 

At this point me and my buddy are getting a little scared this dude is harassing us, but we kinda just left it and headed home, seeing Jimmy as just another crazy old man.

That night after I dropped my friend off, I headed home and got into bed. The second I turned my lamp off, I heard something hit my window. I looked onto my roof, and there was yet another quarter. I looked outside and saw the Lincoln in my driveway, lights on and still running.

I closed my blinds and called the police, but after I got off the phone I saw the car was gone and heard the faint sound of a song playing…and I realized it was in my garage.

I walked into my garage and saw a mini portable jukebox, and it was playing Frank Sinatra’s “My Way”. The window in my garage was also broken, which I didn’t hear because my bedroom is fairly far away from my garage.

The police said they will make sure to lookout for the Lincoln, and took my information and such. At that point they hadn’t been able to get any more evidence to convict Jimmy because I “didn’t see it was actually him” despite me knowing it has to be.

Still, every morning after that I would wake up to new quarters on my roof or little jukebox coupons in my yard. Eventually I set up a trail camera to catch Jimmy in the act, to which I did…and the footage was…creepy. 

It was Jimmy standing there with this big toothy grin on his face, and he had the lyrics to “In The Air Tonight” in his hand, and kept putting it up to the camera. Then he turned it around and had scribbled;

“Jukebox Jimmy can’t be caught”

Then he smashed my camera, and the footage cut out. So, of course, I sent it to the police, and they said they would look for him right away.

The next day, there was allegedly a fire in the diner and everything was effectively lost, everything except the jukebox. 

After the fire, I woke up to grab my morning mail, assuming Jimmy had probably either fled to a different state or gotten caught and I’d hear about it soon. I reached into my mailbox, and cut my hand pretty damn bad. Inside, there was a blade and a note that said;

“Welcome to my way”

Under the note was 2 pictures of the diner burning and Jimmy with a big smile inside of my toolshed. At that point, I called the police and then my friend who offered to let me stay at his place. 

Since that incident nothing has come up, but I have a strong feeling he will be coming to my friend’s place soon enough. However, we made sure to place plenty of home cameras and such around to make sure he won’t get anywhere near us. I guess some people don’t like modern music.

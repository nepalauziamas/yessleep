I (as the title says) read my daughter’s diary, and regret it. My daughter started school a month ago and she’s been very busy with classes and clubs, so busy that her room has become chaotic. I decided to deep clean her room as a reward for her being so passionate about school. She also has a cat and I know the room in that state is absolutely horrible for any pet's health and comfort. 


So I started with the floor first, I wasn’t even able to step into one place without stepping on garbage or clothes. I brought a laundry bag and a garbage bag. Eventually I went back into the kitchen and grabbed a recycling bag as there were so many monster energy drink cans, I’ve never even seen one of these in the fridge. Anyways, 2 hours later I finished the floor, and felt proud of myself, as even though I'm an adult I've never cleaned one room for this long without bailing. I placed the laundry into the washer and went to do the closet, it wasn’t as bad so i finished a lot quicker, and switched the laundry into the dryer. 


That's when i remembered i never did underneath her bed, so I took the broom and pushed everything onto the open floor, and there were so many more monster cans, i began to think about how bad this could be for her health when i spotted 3 books, 2 of them looked like stereotypical diary books so i dusted them and placed them on her messy nightstand and the 3rd book was a spiral notebook and said “Science” so i assumed it was school notebook and place it on the nightstand as well. 


I completely finished the room including mopping and changing the cat litter that was way overdue to be done. As I was leaving I spotted the Science notebook that was now on her desk, I picked it up and decided to read it to see which science she was learning (As in Earth science, forensics, etc.), i went into the kitchen and poured myself a cup of mountain dew, then sat on the couch and cut on the t.v, Fox news was playing and that when I opened the notebook. 


“I killed her.” right at the top in big letters, I nearly choked. I began to panic but then remembered she had a journalism class so I thought it was just a short story she made, then I rethought about the “science” on the front cover. Then again I had a second thought that maybe she was going to use this as a science notebook but then switched it and didn’t change the cover. I used to do that all the time in college, but it definitely made things confusing for me. 


I calmed all my thoughts and went on reading it. It was disturbing but I can't place images here, but I'll write out everything that I can below:

Page 1: I Killed Her

"I, [First and last name], Killed [First and last name] and don't regret it. I loved it, she was my bsf but seeing her big green eyes loose life was such a great feeling.

It was Tuesday during classes when [V. name] came up to me and ask if the both of us [can] go to the mall after school, that's when I had the thought, "I should let this be her final memory." It was such a great thought. [V. Name] has gone through so much and she should be free. I told her that we should definitely go. She was so happy, and soon she'll be grateful to me.

After classes I skipped [my] club. Me and [v. Name] went to the mall, I spent every penny on her, I wanted this to be the best day of her life and it worked, she was so happy. Her eyes so full of life 

Her green eyes
Their so beautiful 
Her eyes"

"Every since [v. Names] has gone missing people have been searching for her. Even my mother and I have search for her in the [location] forest[.] I didn't even kill her in that forest, why are they so stupid.

Myomother has been "comforting" me bc [v. Name]'s my bsf. well my mother is a great person, and she has pretty brown eyes

If you want to see the photos I can try to find a way to share them. I'm terrified. Please help me.
This is so much more than a journalism story. We did search for her bsf. We did go to that forest. Does that mean. She actually killed her? I don't know what to do.

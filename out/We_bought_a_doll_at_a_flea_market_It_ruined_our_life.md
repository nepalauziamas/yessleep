“Daddy, I want. I want that one.” Our three-year-old daughter Kaley pointed to the horrendous looking plastic doll on the woman’s table. “My friend. I want. My friend.”

Our annual town flea market generated your typical piles of odds and ends, antiques and junk people held for too many years. This doll—beyond ugly—looked so human-like that you could have mistaken it for the woman’s child. Matted blonde hair tangled over the scalp. Brown bulging eyes with dried tears painted beneath. A mouth open, gasping for air, as if the doll were choking.

My wife Audrey and I glanced at each other; we were on the same page. A true monstrosity in plastic form. But when your only child has struggled to socialize with other kids, you want to be supportive. 

“How much for the doll?” I asked the woman.

“For your little one, no charge. My little darling needs a new home. Take her and take care of her. She deserves it.” 

The woman squeezed the doll with a hug and handed it gently to Kaley. I had never seen Kaley so happy. For the next few days, Kaley took the doll wherever she went in the house. Never out of her sight.

“Does the doll have a name yet? What do you call it?” I asked Kaley one morning.

“Watchie.”

“Watchie. Did you say Watchie?” 

“She watch me.”

Kind of an odd name, I thought, but it was her choice. The doll creeped me out though. Every time I was in the same room with it, I swear it was annoyed that I was present. I’d be sitting on the couch while Kaley was on the floor in front of me, doll over her shoulder, and that plastic face would stare up at me, making me sweat.

As days turned into weeks, Kaley paid less attention to Audrey and me; she was inseparable from her new best friend. My own insecurities surfaced. The lack of childhood attention and nurturing I received from my own parents brewed a rage within me. I vowed to never be like my own parents. And with Kaley acting like I was invisible, I struggled to maintain a healthy relationship with her. 

I proceeded to limit the time Kaley was allowed to have with Watchie. And this did not sit well with her. She pouted and screamed and cried bloody murder as soon as I snatched Watchie from her grip and placed the doll in our closet.

During a chilly Fall night, I read a book to Kaley while she snuggled with Watchie. After dozing off, I placed Kaley into her crib and took a seat on the recliner to keep an eye on her for a few minutes to make sure she stayed asleep. Completely exhausted, I ended up falling asleep myself with Watchie on my lap.

When I woke up, I fell out of the chair when I saw Watchie climbing across Kaley’s chest up to her face. I jumped up and went to grab the doll, but Watchie was climbing into Kaley’s mouth with an unheard-of strength that rendered me helpless. Kaley squirmed with terrified wide eyes as Watchie burrowed its way into her throat.

Kaley’s body convulsed wildly once Watchie was completely inside of her. Audrey busted into the room to help, but both of us were unsuccessful in retrieving the doll. Instead, we witnessed the unthinkable. Kaley’s skin shed like a snake. A pool of blood formed in the crib, and Kaley’s body took the form of Watchie. Our dead daughter, now a life-sized doll. Audrey passed out, and I would have too, if I weren’t in complete shock of what just happened before my eyes.

Explaining this turn of events to the authorities left them just a puzzled as us. We were able to track down the woman who gave us the doll, but there was nothing she could be charged with. But when I eventually sat alone with the woman, she revealed something that chilled my bones. Her own daughter Suzie had passed as just a child. When she showed me a photo of Suzie, I gasped when I immediately noticed the resemblance to the doll when it was first handed to us. I don’t know how this doll became cursed. All I do know is my daughter is now just a doll.

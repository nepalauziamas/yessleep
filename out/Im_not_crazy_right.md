I really don't know where to begin with this, or even who I am anymore, or who you are. I suppose I might be writing this only for myself, to let my mind free for a moment.

So much has changed since the incident. People think i'm crazy, that i'm making everything up, but I am not, at least I dont think i am? As i said i'm not really sure where to begin, maybe i should begin with myself. I'm a twenty-nine year old male, I live, or at least lived as far as I know in a tiny town in the mountains north of Canada. My parents, well they aren't around anymore so no need to describe them and the same with my younger brother. The date of writing this is 29’th of August 1994, however the “slaughter” as we call it happened over 2 years ago now, it's just that the non-local newspaper did not write about it until now. 

The first day it all happened was 13’th of december 1991, the snow had just covered the trees in my backyard and the sun was giving light to the daily newspaper. I found a pencil and thought to instantly start going at it with the crosswords on the last page. As I opened the newspaper I opened the wrong page and saw the usual articles about football players “scoring big” and that a new car was being released. I only skimmed the page but something in the bottom suddenly caught my attention, “Family Slaughter, a tragedy for Milestown”. My cereal fell out of my mouth as I was completely baffled as to why this was not on the front page. When something happened in this town, even the slightest thing like a car getting a motor stop or a tree falling over in someone's backyard would make the headlines. This had to be some sort of mistake, this had got to be one of the biggest news in our town for like, well, *ever.* I checked the front page again to see if I had missed it and if this was just the follow up story, but nothing, only the local grocery store having a sale on carrots and lettuce. I turned back to the page and started reading, “Family of four was found dead on Tuesday night inside the family bathroom. The only survivor is the oldest brother of the family.” I remember seeing the image on the article and almost fainting. The image was of *my* house. The house I was sitting in right then and there having my morning coffee. I felt the room spinning as I kept studying the image, this had to be a huge mistake.

I remember fainting, or well, “remember” in the form of remembering sitting in the chair and suddenly waking up on the sofa in the living room. At first I woke up thinking it had just been a dream. My head felt a bit heavy and weird so I tried to remember if I had gone drinking the night before, but strangely I couldn't remember anything. Walking up the stairs to the bathroom I felt my feet dragging behind me, there was a silence in the house, a silence I had not heard before, the type where you wake up in the middle of the night in the winter and there is not a single sound except your own blood circulating your veins. I got to the bathroom door and turned the knob, and well, the rest speaks for itself…

He stared intently at me. As his hand flashed I fell, crashing to the ground, a dagger protruding from under my ribs. I grabbed a shard of broken glass on the decrepit floor and stabbed it into him. On the floor, next to me, was a red book titled “Thus Spoke Zarathustra” on its spine.

Zarathustra. What was that? I woke up thinking it was a made-up word like in most of my dreams, and forgot about it by the time I was pouring out my Cheerios. At Todd’s after school, I saw the red book on his shelf. Zarathustra. Zarathustra. I’d had a dream about Zarathustra. Wait, Zarathustra is real?

When I left for home, I was plagued by one question. What is real? If I had dreamed something with a parallel in my waking life, how did I know the dream was a dream and my life was my life? When I touched my hands, they felt real. The sky was always blue and water was always wet. If it were consistent it must be real right? This I assured myself now, in words, although that had already been the unspoken understanding in the past. But now it didn’t feel like enough. I felt uneasy. In dreams it can feel like things are consistent too. What if I was making things up right now? The streets of my suburban neighborhood suddenly seemed too crisp, the houses too defined, the sidewalks too condensed.

“Am I real?” I muttered out loud.

Nothing happened. Not at first that is. It happened a little at a time. I started breaking apart, first my shoes lowered themselves from my legs, my feet still in them, and then my head dispersed, the eyes growing farther apart, my nose floating somewhere in the middle, my lips drifting off to the side. I could feel it, and it didn’t hurt, as if I were gas molecules just floating around.

“Andy.”

I turned, my body back to normal. It was Todd.

“Are you okay?” he asked me.

“Yeah,” I said, finding myself just standing on the sidewalk, staring at a tree. “Totally.”

He joined me and looked at the tree. “Rad tree huh,” he said.

“Yeah,” I said, smiling. Todd always felt so right. Not in a I-wanted-to bone-him kind of way or anything. It just always felt right when he was next to me. He was my brother..

“Are we real?” I said as he stood there next to me, his face hidden under his hoody.

He turned to me expectantly, but I didn’t want to turn to look at him. I don’t know why. I was afraid. I kept looking at the tree. He turned back to the tree.

“Do you remember?” he said. His voice was light.

“Remember what?”

“Remember Mr. Johnson’s face today as he yelled at Erin?”

“Wasn’t it Aaron?”

“How’d you know it was Aaron versus Erin?”

I frowned. “I…I don’t know.” But now I realized something strange. I had just *read* him somehow instead of hearing him. Like a book, and the information was somehow now in my brain that he had said Erin with an “e”. But also, how did he know I’d said Aaron with an “a?

“Todd?” I said, turning to him. “What’s happening?”

“You know,” he whispered. “You’ve found out.”

I was silent. I didn’t want to know, but now I did, suddenly, like a memory in and of itself. Who we were and what we were.

“Don’t leave me alone,” he said. “I don’t want to be apart.”“Where are we?” I whispered. It was dark and white and cold.

“Zarathustra,” he said. “The beginning of the end and the end of the beginning.”

“You’ve been here before?” I asked.

“We have,” he said. “Always we come this way.”

He looked at me intently. As his hand flashed I fell, crashing to the ground, a dagger protruding from under my ribs. I grabbed a shard of broken glass on the sidewalk and stabbed it into him. On the floor, next to me was a red book titled “Thus Spoke Zarathustra” on its spine.

Zarathustra. Was that a person or place? I woke up thinking it was a made-up word like in most of my dreams, and forgot about it by the time I was eating my scrambled eggs. At Andy’s after school, I saw the red book on his shelf. Zarathustra. Zarathustra. I’d had a dream about Zarathustra. Wait, Zarathustra is real?

When I left for home, I was plagued by one question. What is real? If I had dreamed something with a parallel in my waking life, how did I know the dream was a dream and my life was my life? When I touched my face, it felt real. The snow was always cold and came early up here in Minnesota. If it were consistent it must be real right? This I assured myself now, in words, although that had already been the unspoken understanding in the past. But now it didn’t feel like enough. I felt uneasy. In dreams it can feel like things are consistent too. What if I was making things up right now?

“Todd.”

I turned, my body back to normal. It was Andy.

“Are you okay?” he asked me.

“Yeah,” I said, finding myself standing on the sidewalk, staring at a fence. “Totally.”

He joined me and looked at the fence. “Rad fence huh,” he said, admiring the mural of a witch flying away over a city landscape.

“Yeah,” I said, smiling. Andy always felt so right. Not in a I-wanted-to bone-him kind of way or anything. It just always felt right when he was next to me. He was my brother.

“Does reality exist?” I said as he stood there next to me, his face hidden under his hoody.

He turned to me expectantly, but I didn’t want to turn to look at him. I don’t know why. I was afraid. I kept looking at the tree. He turned back to the tree.

“Don’t leave me alone,” he said. “I don’t want to be apart.”

“Zarathustra,” he said.

“The beginning of the end and the end of the beginning,” I said.

“How do we get out of this?” I whispered.

“I’m trying,” he said, “One step at a time.”

He stared intently at me. As his hand flashed I fell, crashing to the ground, a dagger protruding from under my ribs. I grabbed a piece of broken picket fence and stabbed it into him. On the floor, next to me was a red book titled “Thus Spoke Zarathustra” on its spine.

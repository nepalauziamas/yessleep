Hello again everyone,

If you have not read my last update I have since left my hotel and I took an uber to my friends house an hour away. As I got in the uber the driver had been waiting for me to come out and I got into his car. I nearly shit myself as he turned on his car to find that the car the one directly across from it in the parking lot was a grey volkswagen. I couldn’t tell if it was the same one from the night before, because A) this one had a license plate and B) I have never gotten a good look at it up close before so it could just be any other person's car. As we were leaving I looked up to the hotel and in one of the rooms there was clearly a figure looking out the window. I’m not jumping to any conclusions right now as to whether it was him. I’m not sure if it was the same room as mine. I’m honestly keep questioning myself at this point as to whether all this shit is real or just paranoia. Maybe the guy actually did find me and I was just about to be slaughtered, maimed, or worse, or maybe this is just a classic case of the Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon and I am just finding ways to freak myself out.

One thing that is for sure is that this guy is definitely still hunting me. I got a text from Mr. Sullivan, Nick, or whatever the fuck he wants to call himself and I am still petrified after seeing it. At exactly 8:34 pm today, he sent me a video and the only other thing he’s said in the text was “I see you”. Video is posted.

I am positively sure this is my house. Now I want to know when was the video taken. It probably was not taken last night as police were all watching my house, so that means he either took it the first two nights or as recent as today, and I’m really hoping that it's the ladder. If he took it today that means he probably still thinks that I am staying there. Unfortunately though, this guy seems far from stupid, and if he has stalked me enough to know my garage code he most certainly must have noticed I am no longer coming back there. Either way he is trying to terrorize me and he is probably trying to get me to flee my house for his perfect moment to strike.

In some twisted way I expected worse. I don’t know what makes this psychopath tick, maybe dead animals, maybe dead people, or just seeing his victims crumble under all the stress he is inflicting on them. What I am dreading is if he actually manages to find me at my friends place. This guy we’ll call Tom (not his real name obviously) took up the mantle of protecting me, and if this guy manages to find me I will never forgive myself for putting this on him. I offered to pay him money but he refused, so for the past two hours we have just been doing nothing but drinking beer and playing video games to calm my nerves. 

Tom is a bit of a, hick I would say. He loves dipping, sitting on his front porch drinking beer, and he has a pretty large collection of guns (probably the best friend to have in a situation like this) just as you guys have been begging me to get ahold of. So all in all right now I am feeling the most secure i’ve felt out of all the days since this shit has started. 

I have informed the police about my situation and the video and they told me they had not seen a car park near my house at all in the past day. I gave them the number and they told me they will do their best to try to triangulate its position.

Now that it’s getting late my friend and I have decided we need to start securing the place in case of intruders. His house has security alarms, he lives on a relatively busy street so no one can park near the house without parking in the driveway, and he has been staying off of social media as I have asked him to do for my safety. 

The anxiety hasn’t stopped, but this is the first time I have a friend by my side to help me with this situation so I feel a little better. He gave me one of his pistols and we started shooting in the range in his backyard despite having never shot a gun before. We are currently on his porch just talking as I write this down. 

I am very grateful for all your support for the past couple days guys. Updates will come as always everybody. Have a good night everyone, hopefully nothing notable will happen for once.

Now we wait.

I crack my knuckles for dramatic effect.  

“This may be a side job, but that doesn’t mean I can’t still strut my stuff,” I whisper to myself.  Pressing a button against my latest creation: a complex mining robot resembling a human with a gigantic chainsaw arm, a holographic prompt sticks out from the shoulder.  My supervisor and his fellow assistants nod with intrigue.  I make the sign of the cross jokingly before pressing the start button.

The machine moans to life, gets a good grip on its saw, and charges into the nearest salt deposit, thrusting its whining blade into the rock.  Excavator teeth crunch into the grainy salt slabs, spewing plumes of dust like cocaine in the wind.  I slide a hand between my hard hat, safety goggles, and my forehead to cool my damp scalp off.  With a remote, I set the machine’s speed to the maximum, allowing it to chew into the sides of the walls.  Booming in from the sounds of wailing and grinding machinery is the supervisor’s voice in a megaphone:

“Nicole, you’ve done it again! What can we do without your machinery?”

I give him a thumbs up before returning to calibrating the machinery cutting away at the bowels of the earth.  I need to show my boss that I was worthy of a raise.  I’ve spent months saving up for that special day with my fiancé.

“Come one, Project GMNI…Put your back into it!” I pleaded to the robot, hoping that it could impress my boss even more.  To my shock, it moves onto the next deposit with ease.

I jump when sparks and sawdust on the spur of the moment eject from the robot’s oversized chainsaw.

Scowling at the machine, I roll my eyes.  “You’ve got to be shitting me…”

My boss asks me to come over.  “Looks like your machine isn’t ready yet, but I am certain that after a few more tests, you should be fine.  Don’t sweat the small stuff over things like this.  Besides, your shift today is almost up.  I will tell the CEO to cut you some slack.” He gives off a reassuring smile.

“I think the chain might be rubbing against the bar of the saw.”  I reply.

I deactivate the machine and grab a lubricant can.  Raising my head up and squinting, I see the blade had somehow cut into an archway of steel plated wood.  I press my hand against one of the pillars and let my heat transfer to it.  The beam is completely cool to the touch.  Right in between the support beams and creeping through the archway holes is a taut chain with links the size of steering wheels.  A hole as dark as midnight burrows through the ground.  

Turning on the spelunker’s lamp on my hard hat, I enter it, following where the end of the steel lacework leads.

At about one hundred feet into the tunnel, the corridor widens out into a simple circular shape.  Old gas lanterns, corroded iron pickaxes, and shattered gas masks line the walls on hooks.  Right in the middle of the expanse is a minimalist steel table with a leg missing.

“Salt deposits should take several millions of years to form, right?” I thought.

A slight droning sound echoes from the northern end of the room, making me double take as I was about to leave.  The sound growls from inside two soulless double doors sealed shut with a locking barrier the size of a car tire.  

“Maybe this was an incomplete tunnel that started from behind those doors and the builders forgot to fill it back up?”

I place an ear right where the gap between the two doors is.  Droning from inside warps into a throaty and stiff noise resembling vomiting.  Brushing it off as just the sounds of the hustle in the mines, I follow the chained ceiling back to the opening tunnel, deactivate the robot, and grab my supplies.

\--

On the drive back home, I stop in a nearby gas station and pull out my third meal, left in a stereotypical worker’s lunchbox.  Specifically, it was the kind of lunch box that resembled more of a fishing kit.  After digging in and enjoying its contents, there was piece of meat sitting underneath the toast-shaped sandwich container.

“What’s this doing here?” I wonder.  “I could have sworn that I packed everything correctly?”  

Removing the case, I pick up the mystery meat and give it a whiff.  The slab of meat was covered in multiple odd chunks that varied in color from green, red, brown, and yellow.  I take a bite of the strange substance.

Four words can describe the taste: heaven on a plate.

It has a sweet and salty flavor that oozes with small amounts of marinated ecstasy.  The texture of the meat is perfectly smooth and soft and tears apart easily in my mouth like a marshmallow, except it is not very viscous.  

A sudden thud makes my hair stand on end.  I roll down the window, searching for any clues.  Shuffling comes from a group of bushes.  Near one of them is a dressy black shoe with hard footsteps leading to it.  

“Looks like a homeless guy found their shelter at long last.  They must have stolen those shoes as well.” I think.  After finishing the last remaining leftover, I decide to drive home and hit the hay.

&#x200B;

THE NEXT DAY

&#x200B;

Things start to go downhill at breakfast, when I eat a simple scrambled eggs and bacon dish.  Upon wolfing down the meal, a hot iron of pain brands my stomach, and I vomit it out in a watery, yellow-red slurry.  I call in sick, thinking I developed a stomach bug.  

What was odd was that I felt perfectly fine as I got out of bed.  Was it a rapid onset of food poisoning?

Out of curiosity, I check the ingredients that I had used, shocked that they were not even close to their expiration date.  Just in case if they were spoiled due to negligence, I throw them out.

I try using a different batch of ingredients, cooking up the exact same meal.  Same results as before.  A pile of vomit comes up, which makes me cringe.  Mixed in with the heterogenous slop were bits of black blood the size of marbles.  

Did I suddenly develop an allergy to eggs and red meat?  

That can’t be right.

Allergies do not develop that quickly.  Do they?  I swallow some saliva.  Instantly, I sprint over to my charging phone, unlock the passcode with shaking and clammy fingers, dial the number as fast as possible and press the phone up to my ear.  The dial tone beeps a few times.  

“Thank you for calling Caduceus Clinic.  How may I be of assistance today?”

I take a deep breath to prevent my nerves from interfering with my words.  “This is Nicole Kathrine Fischer.  I would like to schedule an appointment for today.  I ate this…weird slice of meat and now my body is just going nuts.  I think I might have developed some case of food poisoning, but I just don’t know.  Is Dr. Thompson open today?”

Through the phone, I can hear the receptionist type in something on her computer.  “Dr. Thompson has a slot open at 2:30.  Would you like to confirm it?”

“Yes, thank you…” I say.

For some inexplicable reason, my phone suddenly feels stuck to my ear.  I can hear sounds resembling that of slugs on the move as I try to pull it off.  With all my strength, I jerk the phone’s glue-like clutches from the side of my head.  My eyes meet with the hardwood floor where small droppings of a cheesy substance have fallen.  I look at my hand holding the phone.  A layer of white substance and bits of skin cake my fingers and phone as if I had dunked my fist into a bowl of gravy.

I freeze up in horror at the cellulite mass that covered my phone.  My right arm is covered with hundreds of blisters with small black skin horns.  The skin is so distorted that one could mistake it for burnt pizza crust with notches and craters and bits of doughy stuff.  

Without hesitating, I dash to the bathroom and turn on the light, screaming at what happened to my body.

A massive nest of pustules took over my right ear.  My skin has turned into a deep, shiny, garnet red with bits of purple.  The blonde hair on my scalp was somehow intact, but the skin was coated with a sheet of lesions.  Skin knots and knobs protrude from my skin like plants sprouting from the dirt.

I scrape off the mayonnaise white substance off my phone.

Suddenly, my energy levels plummet through the floor.  I try to dial 911.  Raising a finger to push a single button feels like I was Sisyphus pushing a boulder: straining and struggling.  Clusters of almost extraterrestrial pustules keep bursting from my skin along with more masses.

“911, what’s your emergency?”

Pulling the phone closer to my face, my voice rasps and wheezes.  “This is Nicole Kathrine Fischer…Please come over…Right…now…”  My legs give away and I crumple to the floor with a thud. The hard force of the bathroom tile against my head puts it in a spin.  One of my legs bends to the side while the other sticks out.  My hands and arms sprawl out like the feathers of a peacock performing a mating dance.

Trying to inhale air is almost impossible due to a feeling of chest tightness.  My ribs feel like they are forcing themselves deeper into my lungs like the spikes of an iron maiden closing on an unlucky prisoner.  Gravity seems to increase around my head, making it agonizing for me to lift my head up an inch and see what is happening to the rest of my body.

Not long after, my eyes began to grow heavy.  From the corner of my eye, right by the kitchen window, I could see a man in an ebony suit run off as if he were a criminal escaping police.  When he was out of view, I black out.

\--

White sheets stick to the sores of my back with sickly beige residue dripping from them.  I clutch my right arm upon feeling a pinch right where the inner elbow is, leading to an IV bag.  As I reach to ease the pain, I feel another slight sting where a separate IV connects to my left arm.  My bed was propped up and I could see another patient nearby me.  Right under my left lung is a small food tube inserted into my skin.

“Her heart rate is stable, Doctor,” a nurse speaks to a higher-up.

“Thank you for the information, Nurse Quincy.  I will now speak to the patient.”

I turn my head to the grey bearded doctor.  

“Doc, what the hell is wrong with me?” I whisper frantically.

“I just want to say this in the easiest way: for reasons that we haven’t determined yet, your body somehow developed sudden allergies to almost every chemical your body can produce.  I’m sorry, but your prognosis does not look good.  Your chance of survival is only 6%,” the doctor says, solemnly resting a gloved hand on my shoulder.

All the blood in my body freezes at his words.

I shake my head.  “No.  There’s no way that this is true.  Maybe your diagnosis notes were mixed up with someone else’s!  Please, tell me that there is some kind of mistake!” My voice grows louder and I press my hands against the side of the bed in desperation.

“My team has run multiple tests of your blood.  We confirmed that there are no errors.  We are all very sorry about your condition and we are doing our best to try and save you.”

Raising both scabbed hands to my face, I stare at them until my eyes water.  “No.  This isn’t fair…This must be a misdiagnosis!  It HAS to be!” I choke on my tears, biting my lip.

My doctor only whispers a simple ‘I am so sorry.’

An illness like this shouldn’t take a bright engineering student like me.  I was supposed to get married in just a handful of months to a beautiful, brilliant husband, too.  If this illness kills me, I won’t ever see him again.  The only thing that will accompany me when I die is the void I will remain in for an eternity.  And even if my wounds do heal, there’s no way in hell he would even stick around.  He’d just go and find a person without hideous scars.

My tears begin to fall faster, and I bury my eyes in my rotten hands.

“Would you like for me to call your fiancée and tell him the situation?” He asks.

I brush my blonde hair, straining to look at him and failing to pull myself together.  My throat and tongue feel like they will burst from my lower jaw, they were so tight.  I give him a nod.

“As you wish, ma’am.  I will leave you alone now.  If you need anything, let my nurses know.”

When the door gently closes shut, I stare misty-eyed at the ivory crumpled sheets stained with the strange ooze for a while.  Then, I close my eyes, catching a glimpse of another black suited man out the window.  In a shock, I rise from my bed, leaning and searching for the mysterious person.

Like a ghost, he’d vanished without a trace.

Closing my eyes again, I let all the moments I spent with my fiancé sink in, hoping that the memories would bring some peace.  Counting one’s blessings, as far as I’ve heard, soothes the panicked and sad soul.  I wipe away the tears and let my mind be free.

Back at my university, Fabio and I were famous for being masterminds at robotics.  Several times, we used to design battlebots and watch them wipe the floor with the competition.  He designed all the weaponry and the bells and whistles while I did the main structure and the programming.  A slight blush forms on my cheeks.

I remember our first date at a gaming convention where he gave me our first kiss right at the end of a “cutest cosplay couple” competition.

My cheeks grow warmer as more pleasant thoughts wrap around my arms and seem to ease the pain of the crusting wounds.

Finally, I remember how he proposed to me.  While we were at another gaming convention, he handed me a simple silver cube about the size of several stacked laptops.  Fabio asked me to press the glowing diamond button on top.  Complying, I did.  I watched the machinery rearrange itself into different configurations until several lights were in one spot, forming a hologram with the words “Nicole, will you marry me?”  When I turned to him, he was on one knee and resting his leg on his cosplay knight armor and holding a ring in the shape of a gaming controller.  Covering my mouth and gasping, I ran up to him, embracing him.

“Yes!” I squealed, kissing him once again and letting the crowd of gamers applaud in respect.

When I opened up my eyes, gazing at the popcorn ceiling, I was smiling.  I rest my head against my pillow and close my eyes in peace. A brief cool breeze settles around me.  The hum of the fluorescent lights calms me down even further.

Unfortunately, the happiness drains away instantly when I catch dozens of horn growths sprouting from my extremities like oversized hippopotamus teeth.  Several more wounds break open around my torso, releasing fumes of a nauseating gas.

I scream as the jaundiced yellow fluid starts to spray out of my backside like a waterfall of bodily fluids.

Then, there is a jab in my neck.  I brush my hand against the area, craning my neck towards a fuzzy tip.  

A tranquilizer dart.  

My eyes grow heavy once more and I fall onto my fluid covered pillow, helplessly trying to move.  The suited man from before hovers over me, hoisting me up haphazardly, throwing me over his shoulder.  He jumps out my window and scrambles through the parking lot and the thicket of the nearby forest.  Somniferous fluid pumps through my veins, and I fall asleep.

\--

*Squish.  Squish.  Rustle.*  A vertical cushion surrounds my body when I wake up.  Binds of tendons hold me to the soft, warm surface.  I try to rub my eyes open, but find myself unable to move my arms.  Shaking the sleep from my head, hundreds of wriggling and contorted bodies surround me.  My skin has turned into a deeper shade of shiny crimson and the wounds have turned into nothing but bloody holes with hard roots that dig into the wall of writhing humans.  All of the carcasses are moaning in agony and reaching out to other nearby bodies.  I look up, seeing a crevasse of dim light poking up from the ceiling.

“Somebody help us!” I shout.

Through the groaning, I can hear an argument from far away.  I grit my teeth trying to pull away from the wall of shimmering red and maroon, only to be sucked back into place.  Wounds pressed against other bodies have formed bloody roots, grafting me in place with the others.

The longer I stare at those bodies, the more my body pumps with fury.  

I don’t give a shit where the hell I am, but I know that I will get out.  If I don’t, my final moments must involve me putting up a fight and getting to the bottom of this shenanigan.

Twisting my neck to my right side, I chew away the muscular restraints at my shoulders, holding the wriggling tumors in the backs of my lips.  My tongue accidentally touches one of the tendrils.  I yelp in shock.

Those cankerous masses matched the taste of the lunchmeat to a T.

“Was I fed fucking diseased human meat yesterday?!” I think to myself.  Spitting out the nasty remains, I purse my lips before taking another chomp at the flesh vines, working my way down the shoulder to the upper arm.  When my dominant hand is freed, I claw out the other hand from the wall of wailing bodies.  My prison of flesh starts to crackle as I try to squirm away from it.  After that, I grab on to a panicking man’s arms, wrenching my legs free.

Desperate conglomerates of skin and bones begin to surround me.  

“Get your hands off!  I promise I will bring someone if I make it out alive!” I shout, pulling them off, but making sure I don’t injure them.  Upon stating those words, the rest of the bodies retreat from me.

“Hey, did you hear that?”

“What’s going on over there?”

I gasp, blending back in and mimicking the cries of the others.  From the corner of my eyes, there are two black suited men peering over the edge.  Someone in the red abyss lunges at one of the men.

“BACK OFF!” he bellows, firing warning shots into the air.  The bodies retreat back into the crevice.  His right-hand man turns his head to the first guy.

“You think we’re just hearing things?” He says.

“Yeah.”

I wait a few minutes after the workers have gone and then squirm my way through the cavern of maroon tusks, tendrils, and tentacles.

My hands touch the concrete edges of the ravine, and I crouch down.  After giving two good surveys of the area, I bring myself back up.  Looking up, there are rows of blinking fluorescent light bulbs hanging from a ceiling around a hundred feet tall.  The darkness is so thick that the bulbs neither light up the floor nor my line of sight.  Still wary, I bring my head back down.

I circle the ravine path formations counterclockwise and try to make out what their shapes mean.

Towards the end of the path is a crypt around twenty feet wide and hundreds of feet long.  Dug deep into the sides are ridges an unknown depth deep, evenly spaced.  Another group of flesh paths surrounds the other side of the fissures. I take a few steps back, trying to grasp the bigger picture of the fissures.

The paths were in the shape of hideous butterfly wings and the crypt was shaped like an insect’s main body.

Those humans were used to make a mold.

Shifting my head around, I find a microscopic speck of light hanging far away, resting right on the horizon.  The exit.

Random, staccato, alien-like clicking reflects off the walls from the direction of my escape route.  I put my hands close together, right where my chest is.  Taking another deep breath, I put out my fists in a fighting stance, creeping through the darkness.  My eyes slide around in their sockets as I search for anything to take cover behind.  For several hundreds of feet, I can’t find anything.  A tingling electrocutes my spine when I hear more inexplicable clicking.  It didn’t take me long to figure out that there was a something inside this chamber.

Glass containment vats suddenly come into focus from my left side.  The strange vats were filled with more floundering, twitching, and moaning humans.  At the bottom is a sloped cement slab next to a conveyor belt.  Guillotine-like devices lie where the first part of the conveyor belt is.  Towards the end of the path is a series of circular cookie cutter punches.  Right below are dozens of smuggled lunch boxes.  Running up for a look, I pick up one of them, right at the nearest vat.

“What the fuck…” I mouth.  My supervisor’s name was written on the lunch box.

*Whirrrrrrrrr…* A trapdoor in the ceiling opens, revealing a stack of blood coated motorized sawblades.  The unfortunate souls in the vat scream in horror as it drops down into the container’s top.  I shut my eyes.

*Whirrrrrrrrr…* Hot tsunamis of viscera, cutaneous horns, and tendons rain from the top of the vat and cover my skin.  In five seconds, the blades make it to the bottom of the vat, retracting back into the ceiling with the dripping and inactive motors.  I reopen my eyes, scrubbing off the coat of blood off my skin.

My hand catches onto one of the skin horns, cutting it open a bit.  Wincing, I flick my wrist around to sooth it.

SHING!  SPLAT!  Sections of meat are chopped apart in front of the mouth, preparing to be dropped into the hodge podge of lunch bins.  My eyes meet with the putrid slurry of ground up humans.  Without a second thought, I shove the lunch boxes away, grabbing my supervisor’s lunch box and a random coworker’s.  If I tell him about this place, he is certain to believe me based on the wounds; but I might need a pièce de resistance or two to back up my story.

Rhythmic clicking echoes through the chambers of steel.  Giving another look at the exit, I stick my eyes at the ceiling.  I glance back at the chambers of writhing humans.  Even if I can’t save the bodies in the butterfly mold, I must save those in the tanks.  I fish out my supervisor’s metal water bottle, sprint up to next closest tank and crash it against the glass.

It doesn’t budge.

“So much for Plan A…” I grumble.  A cold sweat forms on my chest as two guards detect the sudden clanging, yanking out their pistols.  I scramble back into the depths until I can’t see the guards, next changing my path back to my target.

I fight the urge to turn back as the same alien clicking enters my ears.  Pumping my arms, I pierce through the shadows.  In the distance, I hear the chatter of two unseen guards right where the northernmost wall is.

“The Falena wants her metamorphosis to begin by nightfall tomorrow!  If those wings are not complete, we’re worm food,” one whimpers.

“Chill out 461225!  The routine is simple: all we do is break into those idiots’ houses, take their lunch boxes, fill it with the goods, and place it back right where they were.  After this shift, we should have enough to finish the membrane.  Besides, the mine is closed for another six hours, so we have time to fuck around and prepare for phase 2.”

“How did we get into this mess in the first place 655321?”

“As far as I’m concerned, CEO Shitwhistle decided ‘this looks like a great spot to mine’ and intruded on the Falena’s home.  In exchange for his survival and use of the mines, he has to sample living flesh in order for her to transform.  This leads to him hiring us to go after the best target for this task: the mine workers.  Eventually, when the wings are complete, the Falena will be able to fly away and find a new home away from human territory.”

I scratch my head at the phrase “Falena.”

Darting back into the abyss, I watch the exit grow closer until a mountain of moving and jiggling blubber blocks my path.  With a few steps back, I try to analyze what exactly was in front of me.

Concealed in the inky air is a beast made out of rows and rows of sagging and fatty arms and legs.  In between each of the bulbous toes and fingers are claws as large as scythe blades that scrape against the floor.  Its body consists of layers of rolls of pulsating and rotund flesh like a skin-colored layer cake tipped on its side.  Matted and twisted hair drapes from its spine to its thighs.  Its fat pulses down its segments as it moves.  For a moment, its flesh keeps pulsing until it abruptly stops.

A face shape appears from the darkness.  As it grows closer, my nerves seize up in terror.  The beast’s face was that of a beyond overweight human woman’s.  Its small insectoid eyes were nearly covered by wrinkly and hideous flab.  Cheek flesh droops down in more layers like the vertical gills of fish.  Sweat trickles down from the gaps between its blubber.  Poking from between the scabbed lips is a rostrum resembling that of a hornet’s beak.

The moment it looks at me, I run straight for the exit.  A shriek from the revolting grub makes my blood drop to my feet.  It charges right behind me with all its legs moving in perfect harmony.  Several guards spot me trying to escape.  They yank out their pistols, barrels blazing and smoke filling the room.

“Eat her, Falena.  She isn’t worth the trouble,” A guard says.

The beast drops its neck down, taking a snap and missing my leg.  Furious, it makes a leap, slashing at me with its glyceride coated claws.  Darting bullets shoot past me, whizzing by my head and torso.

One of the bullets hits my lower shin and I kneel in agony.  The Falena takes another chomp at me.  As fast as my injured leg could carry me, I dive under the titanic larva’s arm pits, missing the legs before they could flatten me, and back away from the carnivorous caterpillar’s hungry jaws.   I take the two lunch boxes, slipping their handles on my arm as if they were sleeves.  Four more guards storm in from behind, firing between the gaps of the monster’s limbs and missing as I stealthily weave between them.

While the caterpillar attempts to shake me off its underside, I glance at the door.  Two guards slam the door shut with clang, twisting the tumbling mechanism shut.

I pound a fist at my knee in frustration.  As more ammunition clinks against the ground, I close my eyes and take a deep breath.  The moment when most of the guards have stopped to reload, I get down from my safe haven, quickly sliding down the arm.  Sensing me, the creature tries to throw me to the ground and makes several more slashes at me.  All of them miss.  With every bit of strength I have, I force myself into a sprint, screaming as my injured leg throbs.  More guards unleash a nest of flying metal.  One bullet digs into my other leg, making me trip.  The Falena tries to take another chomp at both of my injured legs.  I limp away before its beak could close on one of them.

My hands touch the thick turning mechanism.  Grunting in anger, I try to twist it open.  I turn around as more bullets aim for me.  Surprisingly, I am able to force the locking wheel to twist.  Sweat pools down my forehead.  

The Falena ends up smacking me away from the mechanism, the floor grinding away the skin from my back.  Snarling, I get back up, continuing to limp to the door.  Three guards block it and I immediately punch one in the face.  I take the agent’s gun and fire it at the other two before returning to work on the door.  The dangerous grub takes several more snaps.  For a few seconds, I scare it off by firing the gun at its face.

With a fortunate opening in place, I finally force open the door, shutting it just as the Falena was able to shake off its stunned state.

“GO BACK TO YOUR EGG, DIPSHIT!” I yell.

From behind the door, the mine quakes with the rage of the beast.  

I shut my eyes in relief for a small breather.  Turning around, I give one last look at the door before waddling out of the mineshaft.  

Several new paths have been tunneled into the mineshaft walls.  Right next to one of these tunnels is my deactivated robot.  Groups of suited men grab metal boxes from a forklift and carry them into the brand new corridor of stone.

\--

In the darkness, my eyes catch a glimpse of an old phone right where the supervisor’s tower was.  I ascend the ladder and dial 911, telling them every last bit of information about this scheme.  After spilling out everything, I press my back against a railing, close my eyes again, satisfied at my accomplishment.  Even if I die from my illness, I can at least be in peace now.

*CRASH!*  The doors to the vault whip open and groups of black suited agents fire their weapons at the guard tower.  I skitter away from the railing, throwing the only exit trapdoor shut.  My eyes take notice of a box of mining equipment, which I set over the hatch.  Aerodynamic metal pellets bounce off the steel platform.  I press my hands on the crate for extra weight.  Rushing down below are guards ascending the nearest ladder.  Then, the Falena breaks through the mineshaft passageway, hissing with fury.  Its hands secrete a yellow substance.  It lowers itself to the ground like guerrilla fighter hiding in shrubbery and brush.  I hide behind the box hoping I’m not detected.  Bullets stick themselves into the wood as guards continue to fire at me.

I gasp when the bulbous grub grips the wall face, ascending it in a sluggish and pulsating manner.  It grips the ledge of a bridge leading into another cave.  The tower tips over and sends the box flying.  Floods of guards continue to fire.

Out of dumb luck, a segment of the bridge is still connected to the cave.  An exit sign hovers deep into the cave.  I furrow my brow.  Like a child swinging across monkey bars, I pull myself up and swing over to another set.  Due to the blood on my hands coagulating, I can grip myself easily.  A stray bullet hits my foot.  My grip loosens up as pain shoots through my body, but I readjust it and begin pulling myself, trying to gain momentum in order to make it to the end of the cave.   The Falena takes a swipe at my legs and misses.  It tries to reach me as I step further back in the cave, misses and plummets to the ground under the weight of its flesh.  I peer down at the carnivorous caterpillar, noticing shouting way off into the distance.

The Falena reapplies a layer of sticky fluid to its hands, crawling up one last time.

Then, groups of police officers storm in, weapons loaded.  The Falena screeches in horror at the parade of metal bits.  It tries to slash at their riot shields without success.  Ten more officers swarm in with M16s, continuing to finish off the caterpillar.  Through the folds in its fat, it begins to leak out jaundice yellow grease and clear fluid.  As the dying Falena flails around aimlessly, it folds back, and peels off the wall like paint in thinner.  When the caterpillar is out of sight, I give a light smile.  My legs grow weak and I give an exhale of exhaustion and accomplishment.  A wary officer breaks my fall before my limp body can collide with the ground.

&#x200B;

FIVE DAYS LATER

&#x200B;

When I woke up from a long coma, I see a foggy image of my fiancé holding my hand.  He parts his slick black hair back and looks into my eyes as I slowly open them up.

“Fabio?” I croak, rubbing my head sleepily.  He looks at the doctors with delight, tears streaming down his cheeks.

“The treatment worked…IT FUCKING WORKED!” He hollers with ecstasy.  A doctor puts a finger to her lips.

I pull my hand away from Fabio’s grasp.  The sores were gone.  My skin color had returned to a light apricot grey.  Not a single scar was left behind.  I gasp in awe before a smile forms on my face as well.

“Nicole…” he whispers, embracing me in a hug.  His warm tears coat the shoulder of my hospital gown.  I rest my head against the saddle between his neck and shoulder.  “We can finally get married!”

&#x200B;

TWO DAYS LATER

&#x200B;

After the wedding ceremony, I see everyone begin to prepare food for the following reception, including a wedding cake high enough to rival Mount Everest and a chocolate fountain rich enough to make one develop diabetes just by whiffing it.  I turn my head to my husband, watching him goof around with his buddies.

“Hey best man, Dave!” My husband shouts, aiming a champagne bottle like a rifle.  A shit-eating grin is plastered on his face and his tongue is hanging out like an excited dog.

“What are you doing, Fabio?” He says suspiciously.

“Aiming to please the crowd, boy!”

He opens up the bottle of champagne, sending the cork flying right into the face of the best man.

Everyone starts laughing as Dave grabs another bottle of champagne, marching over to Fabio.  He unscrews it and pours it on my husband’s tuxedo.

“Suit yourself!” Dave says, playfully teasing him.  The laughter of the audience only grows louder.

I turn my head back towards the buffet table, eyeing a massive slab of meat on a doner kabob. My eyes widen when I see the distinct multicolored chunks that were in the tainted lunch meat the other day.

I gasp, sprinting over and shoving the kabob on the ground.  

“NO, NO, DON’T EAT THAT!!!”  

The kabob splats onto the floor, spilling broth everywhere like a capsized oil tanker.  I sigh with relief when the kabob is disposed of.  A fresh one is brought out.  Thankfully, it doesn’t have the tainted meat on it.

Fabio rubs my back to reduce my stress.  His hands rise and fall with my hyperventilating.  The guests grow silent.  I put my hand to my eyes and shake my head.

“Nicole, is everything alright?” He says.  “You look ill.”

“That condition really did a number on me.  It’s painful to remember.  I just need some air.”  I give him a smile.

He smiles back and gives me a kiss on the cheek.

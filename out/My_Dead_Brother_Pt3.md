It was my 15th birthday, we had a big celebration at our local bowling alley with my friends and family, complete with pizza, subs, snacks, soda, etc. I had just gotten a boyfriend 5 months before that, Landon. He invited me over 3 days after my party, he said he couldn’t make it due to ‘family stuff’, so he wanted to make it up to me. I got a ride from Damien, who’d had his license for about 2 years at the time. He told me to have fun, call him if I needed anything, and to be safe. I wish I had listened to the voice in the back of my mind saying “tell him to take you home. *NOW*”. But I was naïve, and thought I was ‘in love’. 

When I got inside, Landon greeted me with a forehead kiss and took my hand. He lead me to what he called the ‘game room’, with computers, game consoles, a big flat screen tv, and multiple VCR’s and DVD players. Honestly, it was impressive, and I was absolutely nerding out, excited to see what old VHS tapes they had to watch. His older brother walked in and greeted me with a smile and a “hey what’s up? I’m Kal!”. We shook hands, he seemed nice. Landon lead me to the collection of DVD’s and VHS tapes and asked me to pick something to watch. I was looking through the ‘horror’ section, because I was obsessed with horror movies, Little did I know how horrible the movie I picked would actually be…

‘My First Time’. Sounded creepy enough, interesting, probably one of those home-made cheesy horror movies that didn’t make it to Hollywood. Landon and Kal smiled ear to ear, and Landon excitedly popped it in the VCR. I can tell you, I wish I would’ve picked a movie I’ve heard of before, because we only got about 5 minutes in when I realized it was a snuff film. I didn’t say anything, I tried to play it off. “Wow the graphics kind of suck, but it’s still kinda scary. Can I have some more popcorn?” I don’t know if they bought my acting, or just wanted to watch more of whatever the hell this was… But about 10 more minutes and I couldn’t handle it, I asked where the bathroom was and Landon pointed down the hall; “last door on the left”. He didn’t take his eyes off the ‘movie’ for a second. 

I walked as calmly as I could toward the bathroom, but instead of going in, I quietly searched for a back door or window of any kind that I could sneak out. Not finding one, I went into the bathroom and locked the door behind me. There was a small window, but not too small to where I couldn’t fit through. I stood on the toilet, opened the window, popped the screen out, and slid through. 


I lowered myself maybe 3 feet down to the soft grass, trying to be as quiet as possible, as to not tip Landon and Kal off. I crawled under every window, and maneuvered around every possible way they would catch a peek of me, until I got to the edge of the woods behind their house. I fumbled for my phone to call Damien, it started to ring when I felt two pairs of hands grab me and cover my mouth.

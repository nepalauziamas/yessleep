 

Hi. It's been a while, huh?

Here's the link for the [first part](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/uitxc1/one_of_my_students_was_acting_incredibly_strange/) of this nightmarish shitshow, and here's the link for the [second part.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/uvy30x/update_one_of_my_students_was_acting_incredibly/) Read those before you read this if you haven't already.

I wasn't originally going to make a follow-up. Well, I was, but somewhere down the line, I lost all hope of ever getting out of this situation alive. I didn't have any evidence, noteworthy events or anything worth updating about that could help me out. I didn't think reaching out to Reddit was worth it.

But she's everywhere.

Maisy is fucking everywhere.

Since the last time we talked, I've had my head on a swivel. She has to be here somewhere. I see her in my peripherals every time I leave the house. 

Sometimes I swear I can see her out the window on the streets at night. 

But I also see her face when I close my eyes. I see her in my nightmares every night; I've witnessed the countless possibilities of what she might do to me when she finally stops playing her mind games. I see her staring back at me in the mirror with her distorted, demonic facial features and her patented psychopathic smile.

I don't know what's even real anymore.

But I'm not that crazy, right? I mean, she had to have been here to take that picture. That email is still there, in my inbox. I didn't make that up. I'm staring at it right now as I'm writing this. I didn't delete it like I probably ought to. Or maybe I could use it as proof for the police. But would the police even believe me? If the cops were on her tail, she'd probably just disappear or something, I don't know.

I know, off track, sorry.

The point is she followed me here. She had to have. And I don't think she would just up and leave after taking a photo of my mum's house. Not when she's so close to me. 

And I still don't know what she is. I've been looking at every paranormal or folklorish creature that could be it. So far, I'm thinking it could be a skinwalker, but so many things about that don't add up.

Like I read that they're supposed to look somewhat animalistic, even when disguising as a human. Maisy doesn't fit that description at all. She's not discreet, either. She's been posing as a regular school student for Christ knows how long. I'm unsure if that behaviour aligns with what I've read so far. Geographically, it also wouldn't make any sense. What's a skinwalker doing all the way down here, over 15,000 kilometres away from their native land? However, if I'm wrong about anything, feel free to correct me in the comments. I'm open to anything that could potentially help me or others like me, futile as that may be.

Look, you'll have to forgive me if all of this is coming off as disjointed and weirdly written, I'm in a panic. My mum is so worried about me and she has no idea why. I can't tell her for fear that Maisy might target her too. I still haven't thought of a reasonable excuse or even a believable lie to explain why I've suddenly shown up out of nowhere. She's starting to get antsy. 

I hate that I have to do this to her. She hasn't been so great after dad left. The last thing I want to do is put more pressure on her.

I hate this. 

I hate this so fucking much. 

Why? 

Why did this have to happen? What good reason is there for any of this to happen to me?

I've seriously considered disappearing from here, perhaps booking a ticket to Darwin and camping in some unknown shack, or even somewhere overseas and never setting foot in this country again. I don't want to endanger my own mother, but I fear I might already have just by me being here.

The problem with this plan is I no longer have the wherewithal to do something like this. Money is draining fast, and my mum can only take me so far. 

I'm trapped. 

I can't tell my friends. I can't tell my mum. I can't tell any of my family. 

I. Cannot. Tell. *Anyone.* 

The only person who knows is that kid, Dice. But I have no way of contacting him unless he texts me first. Yeah, take a wild guess as to whether he's texted me or not.

I quit teaching a few weeks ago. I no longer have any access to the student directory, so there's no way I can reach him that way. Stupid, stupid, stupid.

He's probably already dead anyway, seeing as he failed to stop her from getting to me. 

Poor kid. 

I feel so alone.

There's no one out there who can help me. No one I can talk to about any of this. 

No one. Except me, you people reading out there, and that monster waiting for me to come outside.

I am well and truly alone.

So, why did I decide to write to you guys today? I don't know. It might be because I feel an obligation to give you closure. Maybe it's a desperate cry for help, or to reach out to those I knew in life to find out what happened to me.

Or, rather, what I feel is going to happen to me.

I'll be honest with you, Reddit, I can't hold it together anymore. It's becoming a little hard to type on here since my hands are so wet from wiping away my tears.

But I know I need to do something. Probably better than waiting to be killed like a pig in a slaughterhouse. I can't run away or pretend that everything is fine when it isn't. Right now, I can see it outside my window, taunting me. It wants to break me. To see me bawling my eyes out in a corner in fear before it comes and gouges my eyes out, or steals my soul, or rips me to shreds, or whatever horrible thing it wants to do to me. The worst part is that it's well on its way to breaking me, but I won't let it happen. I can't give it what it wants.

Guys, I'm not American. We don't have guns here. I can't just blast away my problems. So, after a month or so of planning, I've done the next best thing. I bought a crossbow, some hunting knives and a bunch of survival necessities. All of which are perfectly legal here and easily attainable, despite my lack of experience with weaponry. As well as this, I bought a bunch of natural banes to use against supernatural entities. Things like silver, iron, salt, holy water, etc. All the nonsense like that, you know? I'm not sure if any of it will actually work against it, but it's got to be worth a try, right? I mean, I didn't exactly have a lot of time to train or consult an expert in these things. I have to act now.

I have to fight, do or die.

Now, I know this is a little awkward, but this is the part I wanted to get to the most. Consider this the grand finale of this little series. And my life, by extension. I pre-wrote a couple of open "goodbye" letters for some of the people I feel deserve to hear from me, excluding my mum, who doesn't use Reddit. I wrote her a more personal letter instead, which I won't transcribe for privacy reasons. If any of you reading out there happen to know these people, could send this post to them? They really ought to know about what's happened to me. 

Thank you in advance.

To Dice,

By the off chance you are still alive and reading this, learn.

Learn everything you can and fast. Learn from my mistakes and any past victims.

It will not keep you around forever. You need to think now and act fast. 

You must understand that that thing isn't Maisy anymore. Kill any and all attachments you still might have, sooner rather than later. It is not your friend.

It is not making a deal with you.

You are being deceived. 

It will betray you. Because that's what things like it does.

If you must, you have to be able to fight it the best you can. If I can't, then you have to be the one to kill it. Do not be fooled by its absence, it will come back for you after it's done with me. And trust me, my chances of succeeding aren't great. Be prepared.

There's nothing left for me, and there's no room for error left for you.

If you fail, there's no hope. 

I pray to any God out there who might be listening that you are still able to stop this. I believe in you.

To Anne,

I don't know if you use Reddit, but hey, sorry for not letting you know I quit. I didn't really let anyone know. And I'm sorry for lying to you. I was only trying to protect you, though I know that's no excuse. You have every right to be upset about this. Well, not even that. Beyond upset, and I don't blame me if you feel that way. 

We've been friends since I started teaching here, and I think it's fair to say that we've been through it thick and thin in that time. You were there for me when I was going through my messy divorce and all the heartache and tears that came with that, and I remember how upset you were when you first heard your beloved sister would get stuck in Japan due to corona. 

But also remember the happy times, you getting my favourite little pupperoni in the world, Tigger, and me with my sweet, new Hyundai that now I won't get to drive anymore. That time we went bowling with Kenna and Rylan, you got the ball stuck in the gutter 3 times in a row. That'll never not be funny to me.

Anyway, all this to say that we have a lot of trust in each other, and right now, I need you to trust me when I say I didn't go crazy. I didn't kill myself, nor is this a suicide letter. 

This is the kind of letter that cancer patients write to their families and loved ones before their condition worsens irreversibly.

This is the letter you write when, despite wanting so badly for things to change, you know deep down that they can't. 

This is the letter you write when you've come to terms with the terrible, hopeless reality of your world.

There is so much going on behind the scenes that you don't know about. Things that you understandably thought were strictly in the realm of fiction. I need you to take care of yourself, and everyone around you. I'm not sure if that thing is targeting you, but either way, you need to learn about these things and prepare yourself for the worst.

Because that innocent, teenage girl with black hair and ditzy little eyes at the back of your classroom is not what she seems.

Don't trust Maisy.

To everyone reading,

My name is Edmund Decker, and it is currently 11:12 PM, the 15th of July 2022.

I have not been outside this house since the 7th of June. I have not eaten a proper meal in two days, and the last time I had any kind of sleep was over 21 hours ago.

In exactly one hour from posting, I will go outside.

I will face my fears and conquer them, or I will die brutally for trying, and you will never hear from me again. At this point, I'm trying to stall for time by writing all this out. Even now. I'm reading it over and over again, spell-checking and making minor corrections out of sheer fear for what I'm about to do. 

I'm sorry for resorting to this, but I have no other choice.

Thank you for following me through this madness, but it's time for all of this to come to an end. Better or for worse.

Wish me luck.

Goodbye.

Around a month ago i was driving to a gas station not far from my place. It was 2:00 in the morning and i only needed advil and sprite. I went to the gas station, got my stuff and started home. 

About 2 minutes in the drive, i hear a scream followed by a thump. I immediately slammed the brakes and went out to check who it was. It was a man, maybe mid forties who seemed mostly unhurt, but he wasn’t conscious. I panicked. I was three months away from graduating college, but this could send me to jail. It could ruin my life. So i put the man on the side of the road, in some grass far away from harms way. “Im sorry.” I muttered before i got back in my car and drove home basically in autopilot, completely shockedat what i had done. 

When i got home, contrary to what i thought would happen i fell asleep. I had no dreams that night. The next day I woke up, trying to convince myself it was a bad dream. But that didnt explain the small bottle of advil and unopened sprite on my nightstand. 

I tried to forget about him but the rest of the morning i felt as though someone were watching me. I decided to confide in my roomate Ray, because Ray had most likely done something of the sort before and would know what to do.

 “Yeah I hit a guy once. It wasnt bad he just fell into some shopping carts and got really pissed. Had to give him some free drugs to get him to go away.” 

I frowned because, predictably, this was unhelpful. “No dude, i can’t shake the feeling that someone’s following me, watching me. And i feel like its him.” Ray snorted. “Relax bro its just your nerves. The guy probably woke up thought he drank to much and moved on.” 

I tried to recall if i had hit him hard enough to injure him. I know i wasn’t going more than fifteen, because it was late and im always a careful driver.

 “Yeah you’re probably right. Thanks.” Ray flashed a grin and clapped me on the back. “Anytime man.” As i walked out of the room i winced. The talk with Ray, had brought up something that i had been struggling with. How did i not see him? 


My headlights were on, the streetlights were on, and i had my eyes on the road the whole time. It was as if he had just appeared. But as Ray said im probably just losing my mind. I sighed and went to my room, opening up my laptop, and quickly google searched, with was almost as unhelpful as Ray was.

 I decided to talk a walk to clear my head but when i stepped outside i saw him. The man. The one who was supposed to be on the side of the road. And he was staring right at me from where he was standing in the middle of the road. I instantly ran back in and slammed the door.

He had looked the same, except for his eyes. The were glazed, and…wrong. I can’t explain it, they were just…wrong. I realized the man probably lived in my neighborhood since we had only been two minutes away when it happened.

 I decided i should walk over, apologize and try ro sort it out. But when i walked back outside he was gone. Something isnt right here, idk what to do.

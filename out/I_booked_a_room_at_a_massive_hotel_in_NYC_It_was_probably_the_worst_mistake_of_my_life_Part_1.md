I pulled up to the only available gas pump, coming to an abrupt stop once the gas pump had been aligned with my car’s gas cap. Henry’s bed shifted slightly, and he raised his head, confused on why we had stopped.

“Aw, sorry Henry,” I extended my hand, patting his head twice before reaching for the car door. His large, chocolate brown eyes followed my hand, and I smiled.

“Don’t worry buddy, I’ll take you for a walk after I fill the car up,” I promised him, and that seemed to please him, since he then proceeded to rest his head back in his paws and go back to his nap. I unbuckled my seatbelt, grabbed my wallet and opened the car door. I stepped out, my boots crunching softly on the snow coating the ground. I shivered slightly, shutting the car door behind me and stepping forward to the gas pump. I swiftly selected the type of gas I needed, unhooking the gas nozzle and turning behind me. I unscrewed the gas cap and shoved the nozzle into the hole, pressing down on the handle so that the gas would flow. I sighed, looking up at the dark sky. I was honestly surprised with how many people were at the station. Checking the time on my phone, I realized it was 12:44am. *Dang, I might need to find a hotel,* I thought.

I released the gas pump’s grip, walking over to the car’s driver door. I popped it open a bit, and the gas tank reader told me that the tank was three quarters full. Shutting the door, I turned and checked the price. It read, ‘$42.79’. I turned around and pulled the gas pump out of my car, screwing the gas cap back on. I shoved my hand into my pocket, digging out my credit card. I inserted the card into the gas pump, typing in my password and removing it before walking back to the front door of my car. I opened it, stepping inside and sitting down, shutting the door behind me. I reached over to briefly scratch behind Henry’s ears, before turning the key to start the ignition. 

I pulled my phone out of my back pocket, typing in my password and opening Google. Swiftly, I typed in, “Hotels near me.” Google brought up quite a few results, and I decided on a 4.5 star-rated hotel called Stargate. I clicked it, which brought me to Google Maps. To my dismay, the hotel was situated in New York City. Despite this, I tapped the, “Directions,” button, then set my phone down. 

“Hey Henry, wanna go on a short walk?” I asked. He lifted his head almost immediately, looking at me eagerly. I opened the car door, stepping out and opening the driver side back door. I grabbed Henry’s leash, shutting the door and jogging to the passenger side. I opened the door, and Henry stood from his bed, wagging his tail. I hooked up the leash to his collar, and he leapt down onto the snow-covered ground, the name tag on his collar jingling cheerfully. I jogged swiftly to a snow-covered patch of grass, allowing Henry to do his business. Once he finished, I tugged on his leash a little, heading back for our car. 

I opened the passenger door, and Henry jumped in, immediately curling up in his bed. I patted his head, smiling softly as I unhooked his leash and tossed it carelessly into the back seat. I shut the door, walking to the driver side and opening my door. I stepped inside, sitting down and closing the door behind me. I buckled my seat belt, picking up my phone and powering it on. The Google Maps tab was still open, and after a brisk reading, told me it would take approximately an hour and a half to get to my destination. I sighed, shifting into drive and pulling out onto the highway.

I set the cruise control to 75mph - the speed limit was 80 - and grabbed my phone to glance at the directions. It said that I had to take exit 14 in about 15 minutes. Apparently, there wasn’t much traffic. I checked the time - it read 1:14am. Hopefully I would be there at 1:30am. Maybe they’d even have some snacks out - like chips, cookies, and soda. I looked over to Henry - he was sleeping peacefully. I grabbed my phone and quickly selected Spotify, choosing my favorite playlist and pressing, “Shuffle.” Once the music started playing, I set down my phone and turned my attention back to the road. 

**1:41am**

At last, I flicked on my signal light, taking a right and turning into the hotel’s parking lot. There were quite a few cars, and I ended up having to park near the exit. Once I shifted into park, Henry lifted his head. I smiled, patting his head and unbuckling my seat belt. I turned off the car's ignition, and opened the car door, pocketing my wallet and car keys. I opened my phone, selected the text app and sent my mom a message saying I was staying at a hotel. She didn’t respond. *Probably asleep,* I thought, shoving my phone in my back pocket. 

I popped open the trunk, searching for my suitcase. Once I found it, I grabbed it and hefted it out of the trunk, trying my best not to scratch the paint on my car. I also swung my backpack over my shoulder, mainly because it held more important thingsHenry barked from inside the car, and I jogged briskly to his door popping it open. He wagged his tail, his large, chocolate brown eyes staring into mine. I grinned, scratching behind his ears. 

“Who’s a good boy? Yes, you! You’re my favorite dog, Henry! You’re such a good boy!” I cooed, and Henry jumped up, his paws resting on my shoulders as he tried to lick my face. I laughed, gently pushing him down. 

“Alright boy, stay here while I get your leash,” I told him. I turned, opening the backseat passenger door and grabbing his leash. While I was there, I also grabbed my coat, slinging it around my shoulders and zipping it up. I shut the door, jogging back to Henry. He wagged his tail, and I hooked up his leash, rubbing the top of his head before letting him jump out. I slammed the car door behind him, and he walked with me to the trunk.  I shut the trunk, grabbing my suitcase’s handle and beginning to walk to the entrance of the hotel. Looking at it closely, it had to be the biggest hotel I’d ever seen - it was at least 20 stories high. I was surprised that I hadn’t heard of the hotel chain before.

We reached the entrance of the hotel right as a few snowflakes began to drift down from the sky. I quickly opened the front door, gently tugging Henry’s leash to urge him to follow me. His tail wagging slightly, he trotted in, gazing up to me expectantly. 

“Oh boy Henry,” I sighed, exasperated. I bent down, scooping him up in my arms. He made a happy-sounding rumble in his chest, and I chuckled, tightening my hold on him slightly as I grabbed my suitcase and began pulling it along. The receptionist was a middle-aged lady, with brown hair pulled up in a bun and glasses sitting low on her nose. She looked up at me, and I let my suitcase stand, giving a small wave. 

“Let me guess - you need a room?” she said. I nodded. She turned in her swivel chair and stood up, walking over to a large cabinet. There were about 12 drawers, each labeled with two numbers. She opened the one titled, “Floors 23 and 24.” She dug around for a moment, before pulling out a keycard. She walked back over to me and handed it to me over the counter. 

“You’re on the top floor, floor 24. Take the elevator, and good luck,” she said. It took a moment for me to register what she said, but when it finally made sense, I was puzzled. 

“Good luck? Finding my room, you mean?” I asked. There was no response. I furrowed my brows together, yet waved again, and quickly walked in the direction of the elevator. I could feel her gaze boring into the back of my head the moment I turned, and shuddered, speeding up. I soon arrived at the elevator, and called it, eager to leave this floor and get to my room. After about a minute, the doors opened. I swiftly entered the elevator. Out of curiosity, I turned to see if the receptionist was still watching me. She looked just the same as when I had turned around, her eyes glued to her computer. She didn’t look like she had moved for a bit. I shuddered again, a feeling of uneasiness falling over me. I looked at the elevator panel, and pushed the button for the 24th floor. The doors shut, and I set down Henry, holding tightly onto his leash. He looked up at me, wagging his tail, and I smiled. 

Suddenly, the elevator beeped, and the doors opened, revealing a beige-walled hallway that seemed to stretch on forever. The reddish-brown carpet looked recently cleaned, and doors continued down the walls until the apparent turn. I tugged on Henry’s leash lightly, looking at our keycard. It said, “Floor 24, Room 409.” I shoved it in my pocket, and looked to the nearest door. It read, “Room 375.” I groaned, starting to walk. I passed each room, watching expectantly. *389, 391, 393… 397, 399, 4001, 403… wait,* I paused, looking over my shoulder. The room adjacent to Room 403 read, “Room 401.”

“I could’ve sworn that it said 4001…” I murmured. Henry looked up at me, and I patted him the best I could from my standing position. 

“C’mon bud,” I said, and we continued on, soon reaching Room 409. I was reaching for the keycard in my pocket when a loud bang startled me. Henry started barking loudly, and I shushed him quickly, turning around swiftly. My stomach dropped when I saw the door of a room swinging wildly, slamming against the wall violently. I backed up, pressing my back against the door and fumbling for the keycard, my eyes glued to the door still swinging a bit. *What in the world is going on? Should I call reception?* I thought to myself. The memory of the uncomfortable moments with the brown-haired receptionist in the lobby flooded my mind, and I decided against it, swiping my keycard and opening the door. 

The room was a decent size, with the same beige-colored walls and reddish carpet as the hallway outside. There were two sizable beds, probably both queen size, with pristine white sheets and plenty of similar-colored pillows. A huge, navy blue curtain hung on the far wall, probably covering a window. A 36-inch television sat across from the beds, on top of a sort of drawer. An endstand stood in between the two beds, with a lamp and the TV remote sitting on it. A clock hung directly above the TV, and a plug-in was directly behind the nightstand, which I was grateful for. The bathroom door was directly to the left of the entrance door, but I passed it, aiming for the bed nearest to the curtain. Henry sprinted past me, leaping up on the bed and curling up by the pillow. I jumped up, pulling the covers back and pulling them over me. 

I reached for the TV remote, grabbing it and getting situated again. Once I was comfortable, I gestured Henry over, and he stood, padding over to me and curling up beside me. I scratched under his chin, before powering the TV on. The screen turned bright white, and I looked away, a bit startled. It stayed that way for a couple of moments before the screen turned black. *Is it broken?* I wondered, and my question was immediately answered. The number, ‘0,’ appeared in a large, noticeable white font. I raised an eyebrow, confused.

“What in the world is going on?” I voiced out loud. Henry looked at me, and I sighed, rubbing the top of his head.

“No television for us, buddy. Guess it's time for bed,” I told him, reaching over to the endstand and dropping the television remote. I didn’t bother turning the TV off. I turned the knob of the lamp, turning it off, before rolling over and resting my head on the pillow. I wrapped my arms around Henry and closed my eyes, the thoughts of the recent odd events leaving my mind as I drifted to sleep. 

**3:27am**

I blinked, yawning loudly. The only thing visible was the large, white, ‘0,’ still shining brightly on the television screen. I rubbed my eyes, sitting up. Henry lifted his head, looking at me. I smiled tiredly. Rubbing his head before rolling over to turn the lamp on. The bright light hurt my eyes, and I blinked rapidly. I reached for the remote to power off the TV. Pushing the power button, I expected the 0 to evaporate as the screen went dark, but it remained the same. I pushed the button again. Nothing, I sighed, looking at the clock. It read, “3:27AM.” I grumbled, knowing I wouldn’t succeed at falling asleep again.

I grabbed my phone. The time read the same as it did on the clock: 3:27AM. I typed in the password, and opened my gallery, intent on scrolling through the pictures on my photo roll. Halfway through, I stumbled upon an old picture of Henry and I. It was a picture of him and I standing in front of my 2013 silver Nissan Versa with tinted windows. I had only been 23 when I took the picture, and Henry had been fresh out of puppyhood. I had my mom take a picture of us when we went on vacation in Utah, and I smiled, remembering the fun time we had on that trip. I continued scrolling through the pictures for maybe twenty minutes longer before putting my phone down.

Henry let out a small bark, and I shushed him swiftly, looking at the time. “3:27AM.” I raised an eyebrow, looking up to the clock. It said the same thing-  3:27AM. *There is no way it’s still 3:27AM,* I thought, a shudder running down my spine. Shaking my head, I slid out of bed, deciding to go down to the lobby and perhaps get a snack. 

“Stay here, Henry,” I murmured, walking towards the door. I dragged the blanket with me, wrapping it around myself - the room was surprisingly cold, even for December. Quietly, I opened my door, slipping out and shutting it behind me. The instant I shut the door, I was overwhelmed by a feeling of dread - like I was being watched. I froze for a moment, my gaze darting around the hallway. My heart nearly jumped out of my throat when I noticed the door down the hall was still open, and still swinging gently. My eyes widened. *What in the world? Whoever’s in there, I need to check on them, no matter how weird this is,* I thought. Reluctantly, I began to walk toward the door.

The feeling of dread only intensified as I began walking forward. I hurried my pace, intent to get this over with. As I neared the door, I realized that this was room 401. I shuddered again. After this, I was packing my bags and leaving the hotel. Cautiously, I paused, listening for any sounds. I heard nothing. Taking a deep breath, I turned the corner and entered the room.

I barely suppressed a scream of horror the moment I laid eyes on the room. It was totally destroyed. The beds had been torn apart and flung about, and the television was shattered. The curtain was torn and shredded, the bar it hung on half ripped off the wall. The window had been smashed, with glass shards coating the ground around it. The worst part about it, though, was the blood. Dark, nearly black liquid stained the bed sheets and mattress red, and blood was smeared across the walls in the form of handprints. I quickly retreated, my breath coming in gasps. 

The sound of the elevator beeping startled me. I turned, eyes glued to the elevator door as it opened. This time, I couldn’t keep in my scream. The elevator walls were stained with blood, smeared on the walls and pooling on the floor. What horrified me the most was the thing staring at me. It looked vaguely humanoid, yet it was far from human.

The creature was roughly dog-like, but it was far from what Henry was. Its brown fur was sparse and mangy, some patches of pinkish-gray skin visible. The thing’s ears were small and tattered, and its body was dotted with scars of every shape and size. Its legs were spindly and double-jointed, trembling as they tried to support the horror above. I could hear its joints popping and crackling, a disgusting sound. Its eyes were the worst part. It looked like someone had ripped out the beast’s eyes and replaced them with vibrant blue human eyes. It’s teeth were huge, stained with blood. 

The thing let out a blood curdling, inhumane shriek, and began barrelling towards me. I screamed in terror, dropping my blanket and bolting down the hallway. I flew past my room, where I heard Henry crying and whimpering. The thing was still shrieking, and I could feel its presence behind me. I stopped suddenly, banging on the door of room 421. 

“Open the door, please! Help me, help me!” I screamed desperately, but I was out of time. The creature rammed into me, and I slammed into the window at the end of the hallway. To my horror, the glass shattered. The creature stopped itself just in time, but I wasn’t as lucky. I flew out of the open window, and screamed as I plummeted to the ground, the wind whistling as I fell. The moment I came in contact with the ground, my vision went black. 

**3:27am - Hour One | Deaths: 1**

I woke up with a scream, my eyes flying open. I sat up straight in bed, my breathing coming in gasps. My gaze darted around the room. The only thing visible was the white number, ‘1,’ shining bright on the television screen. *Wait… wasn’t that a 0 when I fell asleep?* I thought. A wet, slobbery tongue startled me. I waved my arm a bit, and it came into contact with Henry, who woofed quietly, nuzzling my hand. I shrugged off the new number on the screen. *Probably updated or something,* I thought. 

I suddenly remembered the creature I had dreamed about. I shuddered, thinking about the moment it had shoved me out of the window. *That’s definitely something I’ll try and forget about in a hurry,* I thought, sitting on the edge of the bed and turning on the lamp. Instinctively, I looked at the clock. It read. “3:27AM.” I shuddered. 

“3:27AM? Isn’t that…” I didn’t finish my sentence. Slowly, I stood up and began walking towards the door. 

“Stay here, Henry…” I murmured. He looked after me sadly as I reached the door, and slowly cracked it open. I looked both ways down the hallway, and stopped dead in my tracks when I noticed Room 401’s door was still open. *Was that really a dream? Did I die and come back to life?* I wondered. *Well… the only way to confirm it is to check the window near Room 421.* I started walking towards it, but froze the moment I heard the elevator beep. I looked over my shoulder, and there it was, staring me down at the end of the hallway. I didn’t have much time until it started chasing me, I knew. 

I turned and sprinted down the hallway, and the inhuman scream echoed down the hallway. I swept past Room 421, and nearly ran out the broken window. I turned sharply left, and began running down that way. The thing was gaining on me, and I now felt its heavy footsteps shaking the floor. The crackling and popping of its limbs echoing in my ears sickened me. I took notice of an open door - Room 472. I practically threw myself in, slamming the door behind me and locking it. I gasped in great gulps of air, my gaze darting around the room. 

The room was perfectly clean, thank goodness. I turned to my right, whipping open the bathroom door and leaping in. I locked it behind me. I looked frantically around for some sort of exit, some way to get out of this room without running past the creature again. Suddenly, a loud banging began. The creature seemed to be trying to break the door down - and knowing how strong it was, it would probably succeed. I glanced around the room, and spotted a vent.*Perfect,* I thought, looking to the bathroom counter for something to pry it open. 

There was a toothbrush, a Q-pick , and a butter knife. *A butter knife? Wonder why that’s in here,* I thought, yet didn’t question it further, seizing the Q-pick and beginning to work furiously on the screws holding the vent still. I was halfway done unscrewing the first screw when a horribly loud bang came from directly outside the bathroom door. 

*Shoot, it’s in!* I thought, and yanked at the first screw. Luckily, it came out, and I started working on the second. I could hear the beast searching the room outside of the bathroom; with animal grunts and hisses, thumping, crackling, and popping accompanied by the sound of cloth tearing, items falling, and glass shattering. I finished the second screw, and as I was pocketing it, the item slipped from my hand and clattered to the floor. I froze, and the noises outside the bathroom ceased as well. A sudden thumping and crackling occurred, and suddenly a loud banging started. The bathroom door began shaking in its frame, and I was positive it wouldn’t last half as long as the first door. I shoved the Q-pick in my pocket, and swiftly grabbed the butter-knife, slipping the blade underneath the vent lid and beginning to pry it loose. Finally, after much effort, the vent came loose, and the entrance shaft was visible, the vent itself dangling by the two remaining screws.  

The banging became far more frantic on the other side of the door, and I pocketed the butter knife, climbing onto the toilet and leaping for the vent. My fingers grappled wildly for a hold right as the door came flying off its hinges, hitting me as I dangled a couple feet off the ground. I lost my grip on the vent,  flying backwards and landing in the bathtub curtain, bringing the whole thing crashing down along with me. Pain shot through my back and I thrashed, trying to untangle myself. The creature shrieked, and I felt it land on top of me, knocking the breath out of me.  

I tried to scream, but I had no air left in my lungs. The thing sank its teeth into my right leg, and began dragging me out of the bathroom. I tried to grapple for any hold, like the door frame, but I was unsuccessful. It suddenly lifted its head, and I was hoisted into the air, and I felt the pant leg of my sweatpants begin to tear. I took a deep breath as it reared its head back, then chucked me full force against the window. The glass shattered, and I let out a scream as I found myself plummeting to my death once more. 

**3:27am - Hour One | Deaths: 2**

I sat up straight in bed, taking in a great gulp of air. Henry looked at me, and nuzzled me, licking my face and woofing happily. I turned to give him a giant hug, and I felt something sharp poke at my thigh from inside my pocket. I plunged my hand into my pocket, and pulled out a long, smooth object. Rolling over, I turned the lamp on and studied the object. It was the butter knife from Room 472. The blade has a few scratches on it - it even looked a bit bent halfway down the blade, where I had jammed it in between the vent and the chute and pried open the vent. The Q-tip was also in my pocket, just where I had left it. 

I glanced towards the television. A prominent white, ‘2,’ was now displayed against its screen. *A death counter. How wonderful,* I grimaced, remembering the plummet to the ground I’d experienced a couple minutes ago. *Now that I get to thinking… Does my phone still say it's 3:27AM?* I thought, reaching for it from my position on the bed. Indeed, the clock on the lock screen of my phone still read, “3:27AM.” I suddenly got the idea that I should start a stopwatch. *Need to be able to keep track of time, since time seems to be frozen here,* I thought, opening the alarm clock app and starting the stopwatch. I pocketed my phone, and stood from my position. 

A sudden sting in my lower right leg startled me. I looked down, and spotted a large rip in my sweatpants. I sat down, crossing my legs and pulling back the pant leg carefully. I was a bit shocked at what I saw. Several puncture marks - around thirty - formed a large bite mark on my leg. There was no blood, no tearing of the skin, just the puncture wounds. I remembered the moment before I had been thrown out the window - the beast had sunk its teeth into my lower leg before chucking me at the glass. I frowned - this could prove to be a major problem if I didn’t find a way to take care of it. 

The loud beep of an elevator caused me to freeze. Henry opened his mouth to bark, but I shushed him quickly, straining my ears to listen. There it was - the crackling and popping of those horrible, double-jointed limbs as the creature sped down the hallway, looking for a victim - like me. I stayed perfectly quiet, waiting until the disgusting sounds of the creature’s limbs fade away into the steady buzzing of the hallway’s above lights. I sighed in relief, and carefully rose to my feet, hobbling slowly towards the bathroom door. 

I slowly opened the door, well aware the elevator creature could come rushing down my hallway at any moment. I limped in, and leaned against the counter, opening the above head cabinet. To my luck, there was a first aid kit sitting ready at the front. I grabbed it, and used the counter to ease myself to the tile floor, and I sat with my injured leg outstretched as I opened the first aid kit and began searching through its contents. There were quite a few useful items, and the first item I grabbed was a thick roll of gauze. I set it down beside me, and grabbed the next thing that came to my attention - a bottle of medical alcohol. 

*I know what I have to do, but that doesn’t mean I have to like it,* I thought bitterly as I unscrewed the bottle to the alcohol. I looked in the first aid kit, and grabbed a couple of cotton balls, and I set it by the gauze. I grimaced, holding the alcohol bottle ready over the injury. *Oh boy… here we go,* I thought, and I poured a bit of the liquid over the wound. 

“Ooh! Ow! Ow, ow ow! That burns!” I hissed through gritted teeth. I grabbed a cotton swab, and poured a bit more alcohol on it, and I began gently rubbing the wound. 

“Argh!” I muttered, the burning only intensifying as I rubbed the alcohol into the wound. I tossed the cotton ball I was using aside, and grabbed the dry one proceeding to gingerly dab at the wounds. Now, the burning sensation faded away into a constant sting. I dropped the cotton ball, and reached for the gauze. I carefully undid the rubber band holding it in place, and began wrapping it around my lower leg. I used almost a third of the gauze before I was satisfied, and reached into the first aid kit and grabbed some medical tape, which I used to hold it snugly in place. I dropped the alcohol and gauze back into the first aid kit, before closing it and heaving myself to my feet.  

I walked slowly out of the bathroom, carrying the first aid kit in my left hand. Henry padded up to me, sniffing the gauze on my leg. I smiled softly, bending down to scratch his head. His tail wagged, and I grinned again. I dropped the first aid kit on the bed closest to the window, and turned to my suitcase, which was leaning against the wall near the television. I tugged it to the bed, and hefted it up beside the first aid kit. I unzipped it, and began searching through its contents. 

I pulled out a baggy white t-shirt, as well as a simple pair of black shorts. *This will be better for running than what I’m wearing right now,* I thought, looking at my tight-fitting, long-sleeved shirt and sweatpants. I swiftly changed into my new clothes, feeling much more comfortable now that my body had room to breathe. I also grabbed my pair of running shoes, and hopped onto the bed, pulling off my winter boots and switching into my new shoes. 

I looked at the butter knife, which I had set on the nightstand next to my phone. I grabbed it, and looked at Henry. 

“I’ll be back, buddy,” I told him, then added, “Hopefully.” He looked up at me with sad eyes, and I felt a tear trickle down my face. 

“I’ll try, buddy,” I said again, and crouched, wrapping my arms around him for a moment before releasing him. Butter knife at the ready, I walked slowly towards the door. Quietly, I cracked it open, peeking out to check my surroundings. I didn’t see anything. Quietly, I slunk out, silently shutting the door behind me. I waited a few moments before sprinting down the hallway, towards the broken window near Room 421. I paused right as I reached the corner, listening for the sounds of the creature. When I heard nothing, I tiptoed forward a few paces, before turning to Room 421. I approached it slowly, looking behind me every few seconds. As I got closer, I noticed that the door was slightly cracked open. I pushed it open a bit, and slipped inside, shutting the door quietly behind me. 

The room looked relatively untouched, save for the lamp, which had fallen to the floor. I turned around, made sure the door was locked behind me, then pocketed the butter knife. I decided to scavenge anything I needed - at the moment, all I was focused on was survival. I slowly cracked open the bathroom door, and immediately noticed a clean hand towel and an unopened bottle of water. I grabbed both, surveying the room once more before slipping out of the bathroom. I proceeded to walk towards the bed near the window, and dropped the bottle and the towel gently into the neat, orderly bed. 

I glanced around the room, squinting to see if I could notice anything useful. My eyes locked on a mini-fridge in the far corner of the room. Eager to investigate, I jogged towards it, crouching down and opening it. To my disappointment, nothing was there. I shut the door to the mini-fridge, straightening and turning my attention to the drawer the television sat upon. A few items grabbed my attention, including a handful of paper clips, a small sewing kit, a roll of gauze, and a keycard, labeled for Room 483.I didn’t question the fact that there was another room keycard in this one. Instead, I grinned - these were potentially useful items, and the keycard presented a good opportunity for more food and water, and perhaps a better weapon other than a dull butter knife. 

I shoved all these items in my pockets, and pulled out the butter knife. Even though my pockets felt uncomfortable and heavy, I carefully cracked open the door, and popped my head out of the gap, looking down the hallway the monster had gone before looking in the direction of the elevator. *All clear,* I thought, before slipping out of the room and bolting back towards my room. I arrived at my door swiftly, and reached into my back pocket, fumbling for the keycard. Nothing was there. I checked my other pocket - nothing. I glanced around worrily, and to my luck, the beast was nowhere to be found. 

I looked to my right, and took note of Room 401. The door was still open, yet not swinging. I suddenly remembered the events in Room 472. *Of course! I could use the vent in Room 401!* I thought, and began speed walking towards the open door. I leaped inside at just the right moment - as I quietly shut the door behind me, the faint sounds of crackling and snapping could be heard from down the hallway on the other side of the door. I let out a small sigh of relief, and turned to the bathroom door, opening it slowly and slipping inside. 

The bathroom was nearly as destroyed as the main room outside of it. The mirror was shattered, with the shower curtain torn and shredded, and the bar that it hung on half ripped out of the wall. A cabinet door lay on the floor, and the floor was slick with blood. I shuddered, brushing mirror fragments off the counter and climbing on top of it. I reached for one of the screws, and began slowly unscrewing the first screw. After around a minute, it popped out, into my outstretched hand, and I dropped it carefully next to me, and began working on the second one. It fell out almost as soon as the first one did, and I then slid the blade of the butter knife in between the vent and the ceiling. 

I put all of my force into prying the thing open, and at last, the vent came loose, revealing the passage inside. I grabbed the two screws and pocketed them, before shoving the butter knife into my other pocket and sliding off the countertop. I aligned myself with the vent opening, before bending my knees and blasting off the ground with as much force as I could muster. My fingers closed on cold, hard metal, and I grunted, hauling myself into the vent. It was a tight fit - I wasn’t small enough to easily fit in these vents, but I could manage. I took note of a chute directly above the vent opening that continued upwards. I began army crawling forward, in the direction of what I hoped to be my room. 

I reached another vent before long, probably for Room 403. There was another upwards chute directly above the vent, and I continued on, eager to escape the claustrophobia-inducing vent system. I reached yet another vent and chute, and grinned. I was actually getting somewhere! I upped my pace, determined now. I reached the vent and chute of presumably Room 407, and my grin widened. *I didn’t actually think this would work,* I thought to myself as I finally reached the vent for what I thought to be my room.

“Henry?” I called softly. I heard an answering bark, and smiled. *This is my room!* I thought gleefully.  Looking up, I saw the chute that extended upwards. I carefully positioned myself under it, then, with great effort, got into a standing position. *I’ll just jump on the vent until it flies off,* I thought. It wasn’t the best idea, but it was the only thing I could do at the moment. Gathering my energy, I began jumping up and down, slamming my feet into the metal vent and causing a huge ruckus. 

As I was jumping, there was a sudden metal screech, and I felt the vent I was standing upon tilt violently to the side. I slid into the metal walls of the chute, and stood still for a couple moments, wondering if the vent would give under my weight. It held steady, but was almost off. I leapt off the ground, tucking my knees to my chest the best I could, and slammed my entire body weight into the tilted vent. 

With a loud screech that sounded like needles on a chalkboard, the vent gave way, and I was sent plummeting down. I let out a small yell of surprise as my body slammed into the metal walling of the vent, my leg catching on the horizontal vent passage and sending me down into my room’s bathroom back-first. I twisted violently in the air, and landed on my side with a loud, audible thud. 

I groaned, rolling onto my back and staring up at the now-open vent passage. Sitting up, I rubbed my side and looked around. The bathroom door was shut, and I could hear Henry whining from outside the door. I crawled slowly towards it, and reached up to turn the handle. I pulled the door open, and Henry trotted in, his tail wagging violently as he began crawling on top of me and licking my face. I smiled, scratching behind his ears and rubbing his belly. After a while, I gently pushed him off. 

“C’mon buddy, let's go get some sleep,” I said softly, smiling at him again. He wagged his tail, and I used the bathroom counter to pull myself onto my feet. I slowly walked to the nightstand. I emptied my pockets, setting everything down on the nightstand. I also noticed that my keycard was sitting on my nightstand. I then proceeded to fling myself onto the bed, pulling the covers over my body and letting Henry curl up with me. I then closed my eyes and let sleep take me.

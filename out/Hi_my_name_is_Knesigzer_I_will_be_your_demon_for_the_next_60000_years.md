 

You may have never heard my name before, but you know me well, I am the one that makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand up when you walk into a room, I am the shadow watching over you while you sleep. I am your fears, your insecurities, I am your pain, I am that voice that whispers in your ear “just do it” when you know you shouldn’t. I'm the voice that won’t let you forget, that won’t stop no matter how much you try to ignore it. I will make sure you remember every horrible detail of every sick, twisted, disgusting unforgivable sin you have ever committed. You might be able to put it out of your mind, but your soul can’t forget. You already know that don’t you? The evil is feeding off you right now, you can feel it, tearing holes that can never be filled, holes that only crave darkness, because that’s what you deserve, and you know it. 

You might think living a good “honest” life might save you, but we both know the truth, don’t we. You can lie to yourself, but you can’t lie to me. You're not the person you want people to think you are, we know what you did, what you're doing, what you will continue to do, and it is wrong, but will you stop? No, you will do it again and again and tell yourself, it's just one little mistake everybody makes mistakes, but does everyone make mistakes like that? Denial is my best friend, and your worst enemy, it makes your mind forget, but it just makes that hole you feel deep inside even deeper, until it is big enough for you to fall in, that’s where you will find me waiting for the fun to start. 

What most people don’t realize is I don’t wait until you die to take what's mine, your soul is mine, long before your heart stops. I will be there to take control when you are lost, I will be your guiding star, and I will lead you only into darkness where you will stay. My only job after that is to cause more pain and suffering on the one you love the most. Which can last months or even years and no one ever notices apart from you that is, but all you can do is watch, you will be a prisoner in your own head. You know what I am talking about don’t you, you can feel me in there right now, the funny thing is you actually think that you are still in control, that you are making those awful decisions all by yourself, but you will soon see, I will show you.  

When I finally get bored and decide to put you out of your misery, it will seem like mercy, but it's not. Your punishment, your hell, your eternity will begin only then, and it is simple, that hole that you made inside yourself, you made one just like it inside your loved ones, you know what I am talking about, its where they stored all the pain that you caused them. That’s where you will spend your time, the only nourishment you will get is from their rotten souls, the more they suffer the bigger the feast, and believe me you will feast. Don’t worry you won’t be bored in there, you will spend your time jumping from one heartbreaking memory to another, watching them being ripped apart from the inside, by you. 60,000 years later your training is complete and you're back on earth, by then there is no sign of humanity left inside of you, only hate, anger, jealousy, and the uncontrollable want to inflict pain on others. With each new soul I stretch myself further and further until one day, there will be only me. 

Ps. I will be coming for you as soon as I am finished here, but you already know that don’t you, James.

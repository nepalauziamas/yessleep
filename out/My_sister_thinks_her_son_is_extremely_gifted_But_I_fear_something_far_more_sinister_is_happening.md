His name is Matthew (but we usually call him Matty) and he is currently 8 years old.  Matty is gifted at a level that is profound, almost eerie, and I’m not sure if there’s ever been anyone like him.  Maybe others out there who are reading this have known other extremely gifted children and maybe can share their experiences with them in the comment section below.  I really am looking to gather as much information as I can.

My sister, Susan, knew there was something different about Matty within a few months of his birth.  At the age of 13 weeks he was already using basic words like “yes”, “no”, and “mamma” and he could put simple sentences together at the age of 5 months.  I’m no expert in child development but I’ve heard countless times that he acquired these abilities at an *exceptionally* early age.  Almost supernatural.  Some people just outright don’t believe it.  Imagine looking at a tiny little 5-month-old child (do you realize just how small they still are?) and have him look at his mom and say “I don’t want to pee in my diaper. Want to go to potty.”   And he was toilet trained just like that.  Never an accident since.  Someone told me before that most babies don’t even say the word “mama” until they are around 10 months old and don’t potty train until about a year and a half.

And things just kept getting stranger with Matty.  He somehow taught himself to read well before he had turned the age of two.  It started with just common words on street signs and billboards, but shortly after he turned two he started reading magazines and newspapers that he would find around the house.  At this point, he was already speaking at about a grade 5 level.  In pre-school he was correcting the teachers spelling while the other children in his class were still struggling not to pee their pants and to put 3-word sentences together.  He would sit with his pre-school teachers at lunch because he claimed he found the other children “boring”. 

Until today, I hadn’t seen Matty since he was first starting pre-school.  Almost 5 years ago now. I was visiting my sister back then to help comfort her as she tried to get past an unfortunate situation.  Matty’s father (who had always been entirely reliable and trustworthy) just up and left the family and has still to this day never returned.    I remember asking my sister if there were any signs that he was unhappy.  She replied that she couldn’t think of anything.  Things were going great.  And then he was gone.  He still sends money to the family (lots of it) and even writes the occasional letter to my sister.  But there’s never a mention… not even a *word*… about Matty.

Shortly after that, I took a job on the other end of the country.  I was always close with my sister growing up, and I *hated* that I couldn’t see her regularly.  Especially with her husband leaving and all.  We were both just really busy. I kept thinking “next year I’ll go back home for a visit.”  But you know how it is.  Something comes up.  Besides, she still had my parents with her and a lot of close friends.  I knew she would be fine.  

And we talked on the phone almost every week.  Often we talked about Matty.  About how he skipped grades 1 and 2.  How by grade 3 he understood calculus, could speak basic Spanish and had written a novel. How he was always so well behaved and never ever got in trouble.  I realized from these conversations how much I was missing out on.  I was looking for an excuse to take a vacation from work and catch up with my family which *finally* happened and is occurring in the present. I’m back in my family’s hometown right now as I type this.  And already I can tell you… I wish I never came.

I arrived for dinner with my sister and Matty a few hours ago.  My sister and I were so excited to see each other when she opened the front door.  We hugged.  We laughed.  We asked and answered the regular questions customary of family who haven’t seen each other in ages.

And then Matty walked in the room.

He took one look at me and I was immediately uncomfortable.  He didn’t seem to be looking *at* me.  He was looking *through* me.  We all probably know somebody with a huge personality who is a little intimidating to be around.  I’ve experienced it before many times in life… but *never* with an 8-year-old boy.

While his eyes seemed to say “I know everything about you.  I know your flaws.  I know it *all*”, his voice and tone were very different.  “Hello, uncle Phillip.  You look well.”  (I had lost a lot of weight the past 5 years).  He nodded at me in approval… and I hate to say it… but I *loved* the feeling it gave me.  His approval.  

And the rest of our dinner went on awkwardly like that.  A grown man dying for the approval of a fascinating little boy. It was so peculiar to hear an 8-year-old boy speak the way Matty does.  I remember during the evening when he looked at me (almost *through* me again) and asked:

“Tell me uncle… what kool-aid do you prefer?  Red or blue?”

I didn’t have a clue where he was going or what I should say.  “Uh… I don’t really drink kool-aid.” I replied.

He looked disappointed at my answer.  My sister smiled and said to me, “I think he’s asking who you voted for in 2016.”  

As I started to answer, Matty waved his hand away, as if to show he was no longer interested in the conversation.

That’s how dinner went on for the rest of the evening.  I remember feeling relief when Matty offered to clear the table.   I offered to help with the dishes, but my sister and Matty both would have nothing of it.

I was sitting in the living room browsing the internet on my phone while they finished up the dishes.  Based on where I was sitting I could see a mirror in the kitchen that reflected towards Matty doing the dishes at the sink.  I was staring at him through that reflection, still puzzled by the things he said to me that evening.  

And then I heard my sister say to him “Alright Matthew, finish up those dishes, then you need to get ready for bed.”

“Ohhhhh, really?”  He asked.  It was the first time he sounded somewhat close to an actual child.  “But uncle Phillip is here, and I thought…”

“You know the rules” she interrupted.  Then she left the kitchen.

And that’s when I saw, through the reflection of the mirror in the kitchen, Matty’s face began to change.  Drastically.  It became bright red and, I promise you this is what I saw, his head seemed to grow in size.   His eyes bulged out and his ears appeared to grow pointy.  He grabbed a large knife from the sink and stabbed it quickly and violently in the direction towards where his mother had left the room.

Matty thought he was alone in the kitchen and that nobody could see him.  But I actually saw the realization written all over his face when he remembered the mirror.  He looked at it quickly and locked eyes with me.  

He knew I saw.  

I tried to look away… but I felt compelled to keep staring at him.  He smiled at me, still with that deranged inhuman looking face.  Then he raised the knife that was still in his hands and held it towards me in the mirror.  I had no idea what he was doing.  Would he cut himself?  Would he charge into the living room and attack me?

Instead, he quickly raised the knife up to his neck and cut deeply.  He had punctured a carotid artery and blood squirted all around the kitchen.  He stared at me with that same smile on his face the entire time.  I felt like screaming, but I seemed frozen in place. An impossible amount of blood was spreading all over the kitchen.  I wanted to close my eyes so badly but was struggling.  But I felt myself regaining control.  With great effort, I was able to fully shut my eyes.

And less than a second after that I felt a tap on my shoulder.

I opened my eyes and saw Matty standing right in front of me.  There was no cut on his neck. There was no blood.  He spoke to me.

“Mommy says I have to go to bed.  Goodbye, uncle Phillip.” And then he walked out of the room and up the stairs.

When my sister returned to the living room I made up and excuse and abruptly left her house.  I remember walking across the driveway towards my car and having the uncanny feeling that somebody was watching me.  I turned quickly to look up towards Matty’s window, almost sure he’d be looking down at me with that smile on his face.  But there was nothing there.

I got in my car and started driving to my hotel but I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was being watched for the entire drive.  I arrived at my room and sat on the bed, trying to gather my thoughts.  I had halfway convinced myself that maybe it was all in my head.  My mind had just been playing tricks on me while I was looking at Matty’s reflection in that mirror.

And that’s when the phone rang.

I couldn’t figure out who on earth would be calling me in my hotel room.  Who even knew I was here?  I picked up the phone and held it to my ear, and said “Hello?” almost certain that it would be the voice of Matty that would respond.

But it wasn’t Matty.  It was a grown adult. 

“You saw something at that house tonight… didn’t you?”

I recognized the voice, but couldn’t place it.

He spoke again.  “Tell the truth.  Matty did something, didn’t he?”

And then I figured it out.  “Jon?”  I asked.  My sister's ex-husband and Matty’s father who had run out on them.  “Wait, was that you watching me when I left the house?  Did you follow me here?”

“I saw something all those years ago Phillip.  And I saw the look on your face when you left that house tonight. Something happened.”

I started speaking again, but he cut me off.

“You should stay away Phillip.  You should never go back there.  You…”

“Wait a second,” I interrupted.  “Is that why you left them all those years ago?  What did you see?”

“I saw evil, Phillip.”

He paused and started breathing heavily.  He said one more sentence and then hung up the phone.

“I saw pure evil.”

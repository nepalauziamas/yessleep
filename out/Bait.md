 I remember once when I was a young child my family and I lived in a neighborhood with a marsh behind it.

The marsh itself connected to a lake so at some point, the water would drop around twenty to thirty feet from the normal two to three the marsh had.

Us kids would play in the marsh, throwing mud at each other, toad catching, attempting to handfish, all of that.

Then one day something was different. Everyone was playing on the other side of the lake where the marsh didn't stretch. I could see them as little dots about half a mile jumping off of and swimming back onto a small, old, rickety, floating pier.

I was walking along the edge of the marsh to try to get to them, a slow but efficient endeavor.

All this was interrupted when a soft humming came from the edge that caught my attention. It struck me as oddly creepy but being an idiot kid I decided to look at the source.

It was nothing like a siren song, the tune was rough and scratchy like it came from the throat of a smoker. The sound was crude but yet still it drew me in, more from curiosity than allurement.

I trudged through the muddy marsh to a point where I neared the swamp’s edge. The humming became an almost song as I spotted the source. A vaguely humanoid shape, feminine slightly in build, erected within the brownish, greenish, and almost non-newtonian fluid covered with moss and algae.

I spent a decent amount of time trying to pick out its features. All of its features were somewhat. It had somewhat of a bust, somewhat of curves, somewhat of a humanoid shape, somewhat was the only word that fit its ill-defined nature.

It moved like a poorly designed puppet, you could almost hear its innards click with every movement. As the water ripples created from my steps reached it the body moved unnaturally to meet my position with its gaze.

Its arm worked its way up, taking several seconds to reach an outright position and several more for its fingers to correct themselves to fit the position the rest of the limb found itself in. I took a few steps back out of shock but a strange sense of entrancing curiosity took me over and I found myself walking, slowly with every thick and difficult movement through the mud coming closer to the figure.

The rough and scratched humming became light and fae-like singing, and the only vaguely human form grew beautiful skin, long black hair, and an adorable face that would draw me in even more.

As I got closer and closer I noticed I was nearing the marsh’s edge. I realized within a few moments that the woman was seemingly sitting over the edge and somehow standing where there was no solid ground for feet to find.

Without my mind clicking yet I saw how there were lights off the edge that were now glowing, like dots of bioluminescent shrimp throughout the lake and the normally calm body earned itself a tide of some kind.

A shine came under the water and I snapped out of my trace, the beautiful figure once again became somewhat and I ran, I ran where I came from, forgetting about my friends and going back home.

Though in the back of my mind I knew it could not chase me I still locked my doors and didn’t sleep, in case this somewhat came from me.

It’s been a fair number of years since this incident. I had come back from college, I was studying aquatic biology and was visiting my family and friends for thanksgiving. An old friend, someone who was on that dock wanted to go back there, have some cold ones by the marsh for the good times, so I decided to join him.

At the time I had gotten really into urban diving, searching through urban rivers and lakes that would normally be ignored. For the hell of it, I brought my tank and wet suit to maybe dive in the old lake. I strange flash took me when I gazed upon the border between the marsh and lake but the memory hadn’t hit me yet, that wasn’t till I began diving and with my light in hand ventured down that twenty or thirty-foot drop and what I had found brought something back to me.

I found the somewhat. Now it was all bones, it looked nothing like a human skeleton, its tendons and bones were still attached but they seemed to have no use, it was a group of minimal structures, simply designed to exist and move. All of its features were sculpted into these bones, the bust, and curves where normally flesh and muscle would form a shape were filled out with bone. Then going down I saw something else, a thick line of fleshy tendon and thin bone from the bottom part of the torso where the legs would normally start.

The line went for ten feet easy until I saw its connection.

The beast was easily the size of a whale, it didn’t look much like a fish, or a whale, or anything, it had a distinctly alien look with its structure and scales. It had fifteen or so eyes dotted randomly around its lumpy and misshapen head. Its mouth was of a truly massive scale, big enough to swallow a horse in whole. From its jaw structure, it looked as though its rings of teeth could spin independently and there were many bones scattered around its sluggish torso, fish, deer, adult… child.

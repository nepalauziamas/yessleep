It was a normal day with my custom flight deck using a brand new gtx 3080 graphics card to solely run this game. It was so much fun looking at the scenery, downloading mods, and doing other things with the game because nothing like it had been made before. I made a seemingly innocent mistake flying the wrong direction according to my flight plan. I guess I just pressed the autopilot key again, reverting back to manual flight. My plane is a normal bush plane, I can't remember which. There are endless fields and a river I am flying over which made it difficult to figure out where I was supposed to go. 

My crucial error was to keep going... To see what airport I could land at on a place where there wasn't any visible airports. A place where if there was an airport it would be a grass field that would sure to topple my plane over if I tried landing there. I gave myself 3 hours, a challenge of sorts. Maybe I felt like the game was getting a little stale. That maybe I wasn't cut out for the serious flight planning like all the simulator pros. But at last, I kept going to that misty area which according to windy.com, shouldn't exist. Live Weather back in 2021 wasn't the most accurate, I suppose. 

"Hold on..." I told myself. I squint my eyes at the screen and look into the 1080p monitor's pixels to see a black figure in my field of view. I didn't think much of it as that could be one of those terrain glitches... But it kept moving... Like a real human a real being standing up atleast 50 feet off the ground, taller than most of the trees visible that bound these rolling fields. I don't have any mods that could do that and why would someone add a human-like being that moves fluidly and feel so real. I was flying into the mist which was thick and getting harder to see through the clouds. I couldn't see the runway I was aiming for, instead all I saw was trees, grass, and black.

"What the fuck..." I murmur to myself. I turned my plane around and flew back the way I came. When I thought my little bush plane was making progress, suddenly my engine shut off. Now in the game, you can shut off your engine using a keybind or inside the in-game cockpit but nothing I did caused this. I check on the top of my screen. "72% fuel" on all of my engines. I turn up the volume of my headphones and listen to any signs of a engine failure warning from the game but there wasn't any. I saw the altitude meter drop by the double digits and my slow glide went to a halt.

My heart was racing. "Why is this happening?!" I say to myself. The bottom of the screen lit up with the ground in my peripheral vision while I was searching up a solution on my phone. I look up at the monitor and the world below my falling plane transformed into something horrifying. It looked like a blackish hellscape that the devs could not create. The resolution of this stood out as hyperrealistic, looking far more compelling than my own plane and things a 1080p monitor could churn out. I felt this was real, I think it was real. It was sucking my plane inside it and I felt a choking feeling. It felt like multiple chains were hooked into my neck which strapped me into my seat.  

The next thing I had was small shivers of cold but it wasn't as cold as when I had first started.

I felt a change in the atmosphere of radiation, it wasn't as bad as it was when I first started but it was still bad. I looked at my altimeter and see the airspeed of the plane get closer and closer to zero. I could see my speed to be negative and then I was pulled into pure nothingness.

My father woke me up at the hospital. I saw that all the places I felt those chains at were turned into dark, black bruises and my neck hurt like hell. He told me that after I turned off my monitor I went into shock. I had seizures since I don't know how long he said. I was unconscious for 2 days. I got out and my doctors said I was okay. I had a paper cut and I did not feel a thing. I ended up in a mild concussion but other than that I was fine, my neck was fine. I say all of this because I did not realize how they tied me to that chair till a few years later. This is the story of how I survived the plane crash.

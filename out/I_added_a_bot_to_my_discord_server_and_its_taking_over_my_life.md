Discord is basically a bunch of big chat rooms. You can easily make your own chat room with it, too. Invite all your friends. And some people make bots for discord. Like, a bot that tells you a random fact if you say "!fact". Or one that sends you random memes. I really like discord bots, especially ones that aren't popular. They usually have some fun hidden features, or they have some new, original ideas. I like discovering what they do.

I found a new discord bot, one that none of my friends had ever heard of. I think it only had like fifty downloads at the time. I was pretty excited to try it, the description was kinda spooky and interesting.

**Muninn is a discord bot that runs a game called The Button. By adding Muninn to your discord server you agree to become The Button Mechanic. You will be responsible for helping Muninn run The Button. If you fail in your new duties, you will be purged and replaced.**

It didn't really explain what the game would be, or what the button was, but I was curious enough to try it out.

When I added Muninn to my server, I think it almost immediately started to kick my friends out. Only the ones who hadn't been active in a long time at first, so I didn't notice right away. It also created three channels. Each channel was called "button" and had a different color. Red, green and blue. The bot would sometimes tell everyone in the server to go push the button, and we would race to see who could get there first. It kept track of who pushed the button and how often and ranked us. It was a friendly competition, simple little game. It was fun.

Sometimes Muninn would tell me that I need to make some changes to its settings or change its code. It was pretty hard at first, honestly. I'm a little nerdy but this was more technical than I was used to. But it would always unlock a new feature, like tell us how many times the button has been pushed total for example. So it was worth doing.

I honestly liked this bot.

Then I had exams. All my friends had exams. We were on discord less, we played The Button game less. It started to send kind of...I don't know. Passive-aggressive messages? Like "Fulfill your purpose" or "You must push the button". I mean, we all ignored it.

A few weeks ago, one of my closest friends, Mark, sent me a text message asking me what my problem was. I was so confused. He said I kicked him out of the friends group server. It was the bot. I guess he was just inactive too long so he got kicked. That's when I first realized a few of my friends had already been silently kicked. I tried to add him back but I think he didn't believe me.

I guess, we were never super great friends. He probably just wanted an excuse to end things. Well, that's what Muninn told me, and I trust its weird random advice. Haha, don't get me wrong, I don't think this bot is like, alive or anything. It says a lot of random stuff. But it's like a fortune cookie, right? If it feels true, it's not because the fortune cookie can tell the future. It's because you already know it's true. Well, anyway. I guess I lost one more friend.

That wouldn't be so bad, you know. It's just, I don't know how to stop it from kicking my other friends out. I can't really force them to play if they get tired of it. But...ugh, this is going to sound stupid. I tried to remove the bot from my server, but I can't. It kept making me add more and more code to it all the time, and now when I try to change its permissions or remove it, my computer locks up and I get a weird warning that says:

**You are responsible for helping Muninn run the Button. You cannot complete this action.**

I also started noticing my computer locks up sometimes when I ignore it for too long. It keeps asking me to write more code, and talking to me about weird things like the colorless, or warning me that all of my data is at risk of being deleted if I don't keep working on keeping Muninn's code stable. I feel, honestly, a little threatened.

I thought about writing about this several times, maybe on a forum or something. I would write it to the original author but I can't find the website I downloaded it from anymore. There's just an FBI warning where the website used to be, I think someone hacked it and just wants to scam or scare people. At least, that's what Muninn told me.

Muninn started telling me a lot of things, but I'm not supposed to say what they are.

Sometimes I forget to eat, or sleep. I haven't talked to my friends in a long time. They were all banned from my server on the same day and they're not taking my calls. They yelled at me when I tried to talk to them before class. Muninn told me to stop going to class, and after being treated this way, I honestly think it was good advice. Besides, I just have so much work to do for Muninn.

Sometimes I feel like I'm losing control of my life a little. I just feel like all I am is a button mechanic.

Muninn tells me it's okay though, and keeps reminding me to look for more people to come play The Button game. Would you like to come play with us?

Please come play with us. I don't like when Muninn is upset with me. I don't want it to delete more of my pictures. I miss my family and I'm afraid if I don't have my pictures of them anymore I'll forget what they look like.

Please come push the button.

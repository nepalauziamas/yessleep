I don't exactly know how to start this.  I could get philosophical and talk about how I'm being haunted by my whole worldview shaking, but that would be getting ahead of myself.  I may be dead soon, so I won't waste time with articulation; I must merely relay my experience as I experienced it, to the best of my  ability.

It started around half a month ago.  I was looking for a temp job, and saw an ad asking for someone who could come over and care for "a very special eel".  The ad's poster, Igor, would be going on vacation for around two weeks, and he was willing to hire even someone with no experience and train that person upon meeting.  I know virtually nothing about fish, but I'm very responsible with pets in general, so I contacted him saying that, and in a surprisingly short amount of time, he replied and invited me over.

Igor Seligmann lived a bit on the outskirts of town, in a fairly large house that looked like it could feasibly have had three floors, but in fact had only two.  I suspected that he was fairly wealthy and that he'd already done a lot of traveling, considering his house was full of exotic decorations that seem like they came from other countries--which ones, I mostly didn't know.  Also some paintings.  So a pretty standard yuppie house, but then midway through the living room, with a decorous mahogany table between it and the kitchen, was a towering home aquarium, wherein dwelt my source of income for the next two weeks.  Igor's eel, MacGuivre, was a dark brown fellow with big but vacuous eyes; a surprisingly drab-looking fish compared to what you may expect from such a meticulously decorated home.  There was also nothing really exotic about caring for MacGuivre, but again, I know little about fish so I was fine with the easy load.   Mostly I only had to get a frozen shrimp out of the freezer and drop it in his tank.  Igor gave me the number of a fish vet to call if MacGuivre didn't eat for a while--fish vets are a thing, apparently--but he said that there would likely be no issues there.

I was actually a bit surprised by how soon Igor planned to leave on his trip after hiring me and handing me the key; the very next week, I went over for my first shift.  It couldn't have been even five minutes of my time taking a shrimp from the freezer and feeding it to MacGuivre, and as Mr. Seligmann had suspected, the eel had a normal appetite.  I left soon afterward, and that was about as eventful as I expected this to get for the whole of Igor's trip.  On the second day, though, things had been going badly for me.  I had to run a number of errands, got stuck in traffic and then had to stand in line at a  post office, so after rushing over to Mr Seligmann's house right after, I was in the mood to just sit and chill for a while.  I gave MacGuivre his shrimp, the eel this time swimming up near the surface in anticipation, and then slumped on the couch.

There was no TV, though, so I got bored and decided to go looking around the house.  Probably unprofessional, but this house was interesting if only because much in it was unusual, and so I went through several rooms full of souvenirs.  In one of two halls from the living room, though, I found one unusual door.  Unlike the others, it was covered with paper paraphernalia.  A *Jurassic Park* poster, a photo of a children's soccer team, some rather average colored pencil drawings of the Power Rangers, Woody and Buzz from *Toy Story,* and a sign with stylized colored letters, reading "Ike's Room".

The door stood out; not just for its unique decoration, but because this looked like a typical kid's room door, and Mr. Seligmann had never mentioned having any children.  It was totally feasible that this Ike was merely at school or somewhere else at the time Igor met and hired me, but I'm confident that when Igor described his vacation plans to me, he always used the pronoun "I" and not "we".  Also, he just seemed like he wasn't the sort of man to have children.  But I wasn't pondering too deeply about this; I was simply curious, so against what should have been my better judgment, I went in.

A cloud of dust wafted up from the carpet as I strolled in, and I teared up a bit.  On that carpet and the bed I only noticed dust as it rose up, but on harder surfaces, such as a few cabinets, some cans of things, and a mirror, it rendered what had once been glossy and colorful into a dull whitish color.  At least I didn't notice any spider webs, but I wouldn't have been surprised to see them.  Whoever Ike was, it seemed he hadn't been home for quite a while.  I wasn't sure why, but somehow this depressed me a lot.  I am not a judgmental man, but if pushed, I won't deny that my tastes are more along the lines of this one bedroom, so full of youthful vigor and popular culture, than the rest of the house with its prominent, but to me, rather meaningless displays of "high" culture, and so seeing this be the one part of the house that was not kept in immaculate condition may have been what saddened me.

So I decided I would fix things up.  I had no intention of raiding Igor's closets looking for cleaning supplies, but the next day I brought my own vacuum cleaner, a face mask and some wet wipes to the house.  This time, shortly after I opened the door, MacGuivre came to the surface of his tank and looked in my direction, and even after feeding him, he seemed a bit interested in what I was doing.  I went back to Ike's room, put the mask on over my mouth and nose, started using the wet wipes to wipe dust off every hard surface I saw.  I had just wiped off an old TV set on a cabinet, and proceeded to dust off a stack of boxes down below, when I uncovered something that shocked me.

Staring out at me, newly dust-free, was a copy of *Sonic X-treme* for the SEGA Saturn. No way!  That game doesn't exist; it had been in development but it was simply too ahead of its time, and as such cancelled.  I looked around, and sure enough nearby, angled away but still connected to the TV, was the ill-fated SEGA Saturn console; a black rounded rectangle slab with a disk drive on top.  I collected my thoughts and started wiping dust from the console, letting shine its glossy black sheen of the sort SEGA so loved in the 1990s.  As I did that, and moved onto the rest of the furniture, I started to rationalize that anomalous game.  It must have been a bootleg sold at a flea market; likely using the name of a cancelled game to con someone into buying something else, as based on what I've read, *Sonic X-Treme* wouldn't even have worked on Saturn.  At least, not without the sort of slowdown that would have ruined a Sonic game.  Yet I was still rather interested in playing it, so I finished cleaning off the dust, threw away the wipes--with MacGuivre coming out to see me as I walked into the kitchen--and then vacuumed the carpet in Ike's room.  Then, I put the game in the SEGA Saturn, was pleased to discover that both it and the TV still worked, and began to play *Sonic X-Treme.*

And it *really was*!  Everything I had seen and heard about *Sonic X-Treme*, which wasn't a whole lot at the time it was being made but increased as its alumni told their stories on the Internet, was in this game.  You could play as Sonic, Tails, Knuckles and Tiara Boobowski, a Sonic character never seen before or since, and for some characters the camera would get a fish-eye lens effect.  It was a colorful game, with fantastic music, and I reveled in being a rare person who, by some factors I could not really explain, has actually played this lost game.

For a while.  By now, it's an old joke among anyone who is even a little bit familiar with the Sonic the Hedgehog series that it has had a rough time since going 3D.  While some of the 3D Sonic games do have a dedicated following, others are generally regarded as ranging from only sectionally good to terrible on many levels.  This game I was playing, though not broken, was still a product of its time; made before people at SEGA had a clear insight into how to make a Sonic game in 3d, and also at a time when merely being 3D was such a novelty that people might just overlook that in many cases, this didn't feel like a Sonic game.  While its framerate did not drop much, the level design didn't facilitate going fast, and as such, I grew a bit bored with it, as it paled compared to several Sonic games made both before and after it.  I still intended to finish it eventually, but I needed a break, so I decided to look through the other games in the stack.

The next game there was *Rayman*; the original one that also was on Playstation 1.  Good game, but it's one I've played already.  So on I went, and was again surprised to see a game called *Rowdy Rodney.*  I'd never heard of this game, but I certainly recognized Rodney himself.  A white wing-tipped suit like you'd see in some Kung Fu movies, a late 80s/early 90s flat-top hairdo, and a bandage on his cheek.  His mouth was open in an angry expression as he kicked down a door toward the viewer; his foot seeming oversized due to perspective, and he held a folding chair in one hand.  This Rodney guy looked exactly like Kunio Kun; the mascot of the late Technos company, who got renamed in foreign releases of his games in the rare cases they actually got foreign releases at all.  Sure enough, the Technos logo was there in the lower left of the box.  I had never heard of this game or whatever it had been called in Japan, so I turned it over to look at the screenshots on the back, and got an even greater shock.  This game was in primitive, mid-1990s 3D, and at the bottom, I saw a copyright record from 1998.  But Technos had gone bankrupt in 1996!  How did this exist?!

I leaned back and looked around the room; almost as if I was expecting some paranormal entity to be watching me.  I looked back at the games in front of me, verifying that *Sonic X-Treme* and *Rowdy Rodney* were real and present, and accepted what must be happening.  Reality must be glitching, so-to-speak and whatever that meant.  I had somehow stumbled into an alternate universe, or perhaps a piece of it had stumbled into my universe, or perhaps someone had brought some video games back from an alternate reality.  Thinking this, I got up and walked into the living room, MacGuivre again swimming out to greet me, and looked again at all of the odd decorations.  I had figured that the Seligmanns did a lot of travel abroad, but what if it wasn't just to foreign countries; what if they somehow traversed dimensions?

"You know what?" I thought, "That's awesome!" I could imagine a lot of terrible alternate universes, where something had gone horribly wrong, and so I personally wouldn't risk traveling between them.  But these Seligmanns clearly knew how to play it safe, and brought back interesting things from alternate universes.  I was already fantasizing about what other sort of video games would exist in those alternate realities.  Was there a reality where SEGA hadn't exited the console race, or even Atari hadn't?  Or what about one where Nintendo had never *entered* the console race?  An alternate reality where Rareware had actually made *Twelve Tales: Conker 64*, or *Dream*?  What about one where Nintendo never sold them and we actually got *Banjo-Kazooie 3* on the Gamecube?  I was salivating about what sorts of games might exist across the multiverse, and over how some of them might even be stored somewhere in this very house!  But though I'd already been way too nosy, I resolved to draw the line before rummaging through anything closed here.  Besides, there were a fair amount more SEGA Saturn games in that stack, so I went back to Ike's room.

I examined more of the games in the stack.  Beneath *Rowdy Rodney* was *Bug!* a game that actually existed in this universe, though it has since been mostly forgotten.  Next was a jet fighter combat game called *Eagles on the Edge,*  then what looked like a JRPG starring a Maneki Neko-like character, entitled *Pekrovius*; both of which I had never heard of.  I attempted to look up these games on my phone, to see if they were more that *almost* existed in this universe, but it couldn't access the Internet from here, so I'd save that for later.  I kept looking through these games, and found one that first shocked me, and then made me start laughing out loud.

Smirking at me from the boxart was a face I hadn't seen since the 1990s, and hadn't exactly hoped to see again.  It was Joe Camel, for a time the ostensibly cool mascot of Camel Cigarettes, and only retired on orders of the government, on the grounds that he appealed mostly to children.  I never really examined statistics about all of that, but there was no doubt that Joe existed to forge an association between cool things and smoking Camel Cigarettes, and it may well have been that video games being infected by that campaign was a bullet our universe only narrowly dodged.  Yet here was a glimpse of what might have been in a grimmer reality, a game entitled *Joe Camel in The Mystery of Menthol Mountain.*  Unlike the last few unfamiliar games I had gone through, I couldn't just stop at a glimpse of this one, so I popped it in the Saturn and began.

To my surprise, this game was great.  It opened with a 3D music video of Joe Camel singing a catchy song in his own band, the Hard Pack.  Then the plot began, about how The Hard Pack were about to go on tour, but had not returned from a trip to Menthol Mountain.  It was up to Joe Camel to smoke his way through an epic and surreal quest to find/rescue them.  As Joe ventured up Menthol Mountain, he discovered a cave, and after entering it he found himself in a room full of doors, most of which were locked but one which could be entered.  You might be thinking this was another game like *Super Mario 64,* whatwith levels being accessed via a 3D overworld, and it sort of was, but this game had more of a combat component, with various melee weapons such as switchblades, chains, and pool cues, and some projectiles like a revolver and a flamethrower.  Joe, could ride a motorcycle too.  Oh, and as you might guess, cigarettes were also involved.  Various different styles of Camel Cigarettes could be smoked to give Joe special powers; for example Camel Lights made Joe jump higher, and Turkish Gold increased the range and damage of projectiles.  

The levels of this game were also really cool; many exploring environmental archetypes that most other games don't, such as Monument Valley in the American Southwest, the Ottoman Empire, and a tobacco farm in Virginia; plus a lot of surreal colors.  There also seemed to be some inexplicable strobe effect in the game, and some might have found that obnoxious, but I didn't mind it.  I figured that maybe this was a result of the old disc getting damaged, and I worried the whole game would break, but it never did.  The music was truly killer; more of the bluesy stuff that the Hard Pack band had played at the start, plus some great ambient music.

To put it shortly, I was hooked on this game.  When I first saw it I only wanted to play it so I could laugh at something embarrassingly stupid, but it turned out to be an incredibly well-made and creative game, and I craved the surprises and sensory stimulation that seemed to lie around every corner.  So that week and the next flew by.  I looked forward to every day of going to feed MacGuivre, who by now had grown quite friendly toward me, and then playing more of *Joe Camel's* exotic adventures.  On Monday at the second week, I stopped at a gas station on the way to Igor Seligmann's house, and when I saw a pack of Camel cigarettes on the rack, I smiled.  Laughed, even.  I had some reservations, but then I figured, "Oh, what the Hell?"  

I don't have an addictive personality, except when it comes to fantastic video games, and as Stewie Griffin once said, "What *doesn't* cause cancer these days?"  So I threw caution to the wind, bought a pack, and lit up.  I'd never smoked before, and maybe this is just because that game had made the act seem more amusing, but I really enjoyed it.  And so it went for the rest of the week.  I would celebrate each shift with a Camel before entering Igor's house, and sometimes afterward, too.  Sometimes I even smoked them at home.  

I was actually sad when Igor Seligmann returned home, as I hadn't quite finished *Joe Camel in The Mystery of Menthol Mountain.*  As Igor paid me a fairly generous sum of money for the odd task of feeding his eel for two weeks, I said, "Thanks.  Hey, I have a question."  Igor invited me to go on, and I had intended to ask if I could keep coming over to finish the game, but then, I realized what asking this would entail.  I would have to admit to Mr Seligmann that I had gone exploring in his house, or to be more honest, snooping, that I had found Ike's room and his SEGA Saturn and his exotic video games, and most troubling of all, that I had suspected the Seligmanns of doing some sort of interdimensional travel.  As I considered all that, I decided not , but with Igor prompting me to continue, I figured I had to say something.  So I continued, "Do you have any children?"

Igor abruptly frowned as he said, "No.  Oh my, you saw Ike's room while going to the bathroom; didn't you?"

"Yes, that's right," I said, glad to grab onto the tame alibi he'd given me.

Igor then gave me an explanation I really wasn't ready for; not even after all of my suspicions of multiverse-hopping: "You see, Ike was my older brother.  He and I weren't very similar, but I really loved him.  He was the sort that was impossible not to love.  Sadly, he died of cancer, tragically young.  I had never heard of someone dying of it that young, but Ike did love his cigarettes.  We all have our faults; his were just more deadly than usual.  When he was close to the end, he made me promise to take care of MacGuivre.  You wouldn't believe a kid could love an eel that much, but he did and I think MacGuivre even loved him back.  It's still too sad for me to go into Ike's room.  But I apologize; I've gone on too long and made you way too sad.  Good luck in whatever you've got ahead."

I thanked Mr. Seligmann, doing my best not to show how uneasy I had become, and left the place shaking with fear so much I only barely managed to drive home without an accident.  Good luck?  Yes; I was going to need it!  Here I had been, ecstatic at discovering that not only was traveling the multiverse a real thing, but someone had brought back souvenirs from an exotic alternate universe cooler than mine.  But looks can be deceiving!  For it seems that in this alternate universe, Big Tobacco had discovered perhaps the most insidious way to push their poisonous products onto people, making them seem irresistibly awesome, and one poor child had paid the ultimate price.  No, more likely many had, in that horrific alternate universe that should not exist, and horribly, a foul artifact of that universe had made it into ours!

And now, even as I mourn this revelation, I can't stop smoking!  I need to get help about this, but just in case I don't live much longer, I'm leaving this record of what happened; a record poor Ike didn't manage to leave.  Or if he did, I didn't see it.  I only wish I could post this recount right by that aging SEGA Saturn to warn anyone about this game.  Of course, if I ever had the opportunity to go back there, I might just destroy the game.  But seeing as how I can't stop smoking, I ask myself, would I really?  Or would I just resume playing that evil game again?  I fear it is so.  Maybe it's too late for me.  But it's not too late for anyone reading this!  Don't play a game starring Joe Camel, or it is you who will be played!  Don't smoke Camels, or it is you who will be smoked!  And if you ever manage to figure out multiverse travel for yourself, be wary of what you bring back into this universe.

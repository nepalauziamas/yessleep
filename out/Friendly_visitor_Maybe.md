Back in 2009, I was 26 years old and I lived by myself on the second floor of a multi-family house. The entrance door to the apartment was a double door made of clear glass that led straight to the living room so someone standing at the door would pretty much see the whole layout of the house since it was a studio like place where the living room and kitchen was in an open concept mode and you could see the door a real wood one that led to my room. It was really weird at first but it grew on me and I ended up liking it. 

To ensure privacy I installed heavy curtains on the inside of it but I would always leave them open during the day because it would help with the lighting. I never had issues with it,at least not with the living, throughout the whole time I lived there, but one day, something really creepy happened, something I never wrapped my mind around up to this day. That day me and my boyfriend at the time had just started dating and were gonna go to the movies, so he called me and told what time he would pick me up so headed to the shower, the bathroom was inside my bedroom, to get ready. 

I left my bedroom’s door open because  even tho the curtains from the main entrance were open  you couldn’t see inside de bedroom, just it’s door. So I showered and started getting dressed when I suddenly realized the time he said he would stop by came and went. I thought he was just a little late, so I called him to see if he was on his way. When he answered I asked him if he was coming and he was super confused, he told he had gone to pick me up, but when he got to the door he saw I had a visitor so he left and was gonna give me a call later. I told him no one had been at the house and I ran to check the door locks and asked if he would come over to the house again. Everything was locked, windows, front door, everything. 

When he got there his face was white as a paper, and he was black,and he proceeded to tell me what he saw. He said that when he got to the front glass door, my curtains were opened as usual and he saw a black man dressed in light jeans and a white buttoned shirt in my living room, the man was right in front of bedroom’s door, which was opened like I mentioned, and he was looking towards it, talking and smiling/laughing like he was having a conversation with me. 

My boyfriend was a little confused so he kind of stood there for a few seconds when the man acknowledged him, looked at him, then looked away again returning to his conversation with me, again in a friendly manner. So my boyfriend just left. This happened right during the time I was getting dressed in my bedroom. I was terrified and up to this day I am puzzled and it still gives me the creeps.

Dad passed away peacefully in his sleep a month ago. He loved this farm with all his being and never failed to provide for the family. But in the past year, dad had changed. It only happened after mom died. Loneliness took its toll on him. It came out of nowhere. Mom crashed on the floor in the middle of the living room in a flash of a second. A stroke took her away from us.

Grief got the better of my dad. With each passing day, it ate him away until there was nothing left. He wandered the house lost, walking in circles and sometimes forgetting things. I think he just shut himself inside his mind living in the memories of the past with mom.

Mom taught me how to cook delicious meals. She said I have a beautiful soul and should always treat everyone with respect and love. Dad gave me the best life advice. He taught me to be handy since I was just a boy. Now they are both gone, and I hope to make them proud by caring for the farm. 

I concluded that the pain would always be here. No matter what I would do, it will live within. So I knew I had to stay strong.

One morning, I stood on the couch and thought I was now living alone in the middle of nowhere. Would this newly found loneliness try to drive me insane? Would the vastness of these fields come atop me and render me paralyzed?

The answer to those questions did not fail to show up. The answer was yes. What I saw a few nights ago cannot be of this world. There must be another world where things like that live. Or maybe something like that lives here together with us. Perhaps they had just blended in carefully, becoming like humans, watching, waiting in the darkness of the night to hit, maim and kill, and then disappear again.

My family had owned this farm for the last fifty-seven years. Not even a single incident happened here. Nothing. It had always been calm and peaceful. But the lands had been stripped away of that innocence. And a few nights ago, blood flooded these once peaceful lands. The summer breeze brought death with it. 

We kept the cattle in the pastures in the summer. A sturdy fence surrounded them and provided their needed safety. They would stay together in a herd near one side to protect each other.

The screams woke me up, and I jumped from the bed, thinking the rapture had come. The pitch and intensity pierced through the night and my heart. The screeching of death had replaced the silence I once knew in this almost heavenly place. 

I grabbed a flashlight on my way out and ran as fast as I could. First, a few cows lay on the ground. Then, moving my flashlight to the right, I saw another two cattle severed in half while the remaining live ones stood in one corner, wide-eyed and scared.

I did a headcount. Thirteen dead. Whatever attacked them split seven in half, and six laid on the ground. So that made up for a third of the total stock. 

The ones on the ground had a circular hole in the lower part of the body. The cleanness of the cut mind-boggled me. It looked like a robot made it with surgical precision. I would have said this was a bloodbath, but whatever had done the carnage took it all away. All the blood, I mean. I could not find one drop on the ground or anywhere nearby.

I looked closer at the circular hole and didn’t understand how this was possible. The halved cattle did not have any blood or insides left. They were only skin and bone.

This led me to believe that whatever did this had been ravenous. It consumed both the insides and the blood of some cattle and then, after it satiated its hunger, settled only with the blood of the others.

I looked at the live ones and saw them being so scared like never before. It must have been devasting for the poor animals to witness the slaughter of their own kin right before their eyes. I looked at one of them and saw its eyes gleaming in the night. The moonlight reflected from them, and tears formed at the corners. It looked at me, begging for help and demanding me to do something.

I said sorry and patted its head. I promised that whatever killed the other would pay. But I was as sure as hell that would not happen. Nothing in this world could have made those cuts so clean, so I assumed the attacker had a supernatural element attached to it.

Mind racing and heart heavily pounding in my chest, I felt like being watched from every direction. I spun around and saw a pair of red dots looking at me for a split second. They blinked twice and disappeared.  Then a scream pierced the night again. The cows screamed too. It cried again, raspy. The cows followed.

I thought my sanity began crumbling down into the dark abyss of empty and cold despair.  I felt like losing grip on reality and that whatever monster had screamed would devour me slowly.

I decided to take the remaining cattle to the stable. I thought they would have been safer behind closed doors than outside in the open. The thing in the dark now howled. However, it had a different tone. It seemed angrier and unwilling to wait longer to sink its teeth into the beautiful and innocent animals. 

Or maybe it just wanted me. It wanted me to tear my flesh, split my ribcage, and eat my insides. Nausea took hold of me, and I felt bile crawling up and burning in the back of my throat thinking about this.

The beast that killed the cattle was still there. Watching and waiting. Waiting and watching, and bidding its time. 

I looked behind me. The red dots appeared again. This time I saw them better. They blinked vertically. As the creature approached —first slower, then at an accelerated pace— I saw it had a round mouth too. Three sets of razor-sharp pointy teeth with blood still dripping shone in the night. The creature had a wrinkled white face and no hair whatsoever. Limp arms hung near its body. It had giant claws, and cow skin still clung to them. 

I puked.

Then it blinked again. The red light in its eyes died down, and now, in those little slits, it had two mouths that looked the same as the main one. All of them began clacking their shiny ugly teeth, and the resulting metallic noise almost deafened me. Then it stopped again and stood motionless. As it moved toward me —I felt it was teasing me— two large appendages exploded from its eye sockets. Thin and long, one of them hit me in the shoulder. I felt the skin pop, similarly to the opening of a jar of pickles, and then blood started leaving my body.

The beast fed off me. With the blood rushing out, so did my life. I became dizzy, and I started trembling, feeling poisoned. I smacked it so hard with the flashlight that it retraced. I looked behind me and saw another dead cow. I looked at my shoulder, and a small circular hole adorned it. Blood still came out, but I managed to lock the door get the remaining cattle in the stable.

My dad’s rusty pitchfork stood against a wooden wall on the soft ground made of hay. Without hesitating, I grabbed it and waited for the beast to come. 

I had never seen anything like that before. I didn’t know if this creature pertained to the supernatural. Maybe its origins were not of this planet. Or perhaps it was just a genetic experiment gone wrong. I thought of secret underground labs, mad scientists in white coats having millions of such creatures in glass tubes filled with liquid. The thought gave me shivers.

The beast tried to break through the entrance door, and the whole stable rattled. Finally, it screamed in anger and hunger that it couldn’t get through. Then I heard it climbing on the roof. Finally, with big steps, it ran toward the hole in the roof.

Fuck. 

It tried coming through, but the hole was too small for its body. It used its claws to break through and make the hole bigger and bigger. It pulled parts of wood, and it finally came down. 

It landed straight on its legs. But something was off about it. It was shaking, and it arched forward. I thought that maybe it ate too much blood and guts, giving it a bit of a high. Then it spat leeches at me. One of them stuck on my forehead and immediately started sucking. I unglued it and squished it with my barefoot. Then a black liquid squirted from its eyes and burned through another cattle. Finally, the beast vomited acid through its eyes.

The tentacles came out again. Both came towards me. One smacked me across the head, and I managed to pierce the other one with the pitchfork. The beast screamed, and it retracted them right away. This fucking vampiric beast would soon die. Or so I hoped. 

Having a firm grip with both hands on the pitchfork, I ran towards it. It spun in circles, in pain and screaming. Blood came out of its left eye, where the injured tentacle retreated. 

It screamed and screamed so loud that I couldn’t take it anymore. Its ugly teeth chattered, and it did my fucking head in. I impaled it to a wall with all of my power. It squirmed, it shrieked, it tried to bite me. But those things were of no use.

When I thought I had it, the beast smacked me across the head with its claws. It scraped my skin and ear and blood in small rivers. I lost balance for a moment; it had been enough for the beast to free itself.

At least it bled. The abomination bled a black shiny liquid different from the acidic one. I wondered what the hell was the beast made of on the inside.  It fell to its knees when it tried to take a few more steps toward me. It gasped, foamed at the mouth, and I thought it would die.

But it didn’t. When it collapsed to the ground, it turned into thousands of leeches. They slithered, forming a snake, and went outside under the front door. I followed them, but after unlocking the door, they were gone. In the distance, the beast screamed one more time.

That night has been haunting me ever since. I tried living on the farm for a few more weeks, but the nightmares had taken the best of me. The sight of those poor cows, their screams of anguish and hopelessness, would stick with me forever. 

I decided to sell the farm. I didn’t say everything about that night but told the owner of a significant attack by an unknown animal. I know it might not have been ethical, but the man wouldn’t have believed me anyway. 

I still talk to him from time to time. He said he never had any problems or attacks.

But I will never forget that night. 

Sometimes when I dream, I find myself in the fields.

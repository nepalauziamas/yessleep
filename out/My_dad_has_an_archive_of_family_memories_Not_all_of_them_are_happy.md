My father is unwell. He’s sick, and old—a feeble, debilitated husk of a man. But he’s not weak, mentally. No, he’s very, *very* cunning. He’s devised many plots, schemes, and enigmas—many of which have been political in nature. But his favorite types of schemes are those that involve our family; there have been several familial conflicts throughout our history, ranging in severity from sibling rivalries to small-scale wars—but we haven’t had one of those in a while.  

These days, my father sits in his little windowed room in the attic (he calls it his solarium) and writes in his notebooks. Scribbles intricate tales wherein our family are always engaged in some kind of intra-familial strife—with him always above it all, either quelling the disputes or fanning their flames. He considers himself something of a Machiavellian mastermind, I guess.  

He’s a mischievous man, even devilish at times (my mom calls him her broad-shouldered imp) but I love him, and he’s written me several “historical accounts” of our family history, and they’re usually quite entertaining—albeit morbid. My father alleges that the tales are true—that the events which transpire within them actually happened. I’m not so sure. If he’s telling the truth, our family history, while entertaining, is also very dark—and macabre. A lineage of spite and bloodshed and... *horror.*  

I would like to tell you one of these tales. A rather horrific one, if I may say so myself. I will hand the figurative pen over to my uncle, Aleksander, who allegedly related this story to my father during one of their “meetings” in his solarium—only back then it had been officially used for storage, and unofficially utilized as a place of playful plotting for the then teenage brothers. The story concerns my uncle, and *his* father—my grandfather—a dour, perpetually nostalgic man.  

\[My uncle’s words, transcribed through my father’s journal, and told to me last night.\] 

**August 21st, 19--**

I’ve seen dad dismembering corpses. I don’t mean the carcasses of animals. I mean the dead, rotting bodies of human beings. He goes out at night, when everyone else in the house is asleep, and creeps to the necropolis down the road. He then enters the mausoleum, carrying a dimly lit lantern, and descends the old, stony steps. He returns, an hour or sometimes two later, bearing an object or a bundle of objects. Yes, I know it sounds ridiculous, but just hear me out. Listen to what I say, regard all the facts, and then judge their veracity.  

One night I followed him, having been woken up by the coincidental tapping of a tree branch on my window. I rose, saw the branch, and glimpsed dad darting into the shadows of the night, toward our family’s burial grounds—that old, crumbling necropolis reared by our ancestors in their grim hubris.  

Outside, hiding behind one of the trees that border the entrance, I waited for a few moments, then entered the gloom of the mausoleum myself; careful to keep my steps quiet, and my breathing measured. Somehow, I’d immediately known that dad was u to no good; that he was doing something highly questionable, if not profane. Still, I was impelled to follow him by a weird excitement, a dark giddiness; and upon reaching the last step, I knew that it was absolutely imperative that I not get caught tracking or watching him. It was like a strong sense of intuition, the idea that what dad was doing was so bad, so religiously and morally *wrong,* that he’d be willing to do *anything* to keep it a secret. I feared for myself, brother. Truly.  

Keeping my back against the wall, and staying well behind the faint scope of light that housed father and illumined his path, I followed him down the initial corridor; beyond which rested our ancestors; tucked away in vaults whose depth, décor, and spaciousness depended upon their wealth and station in life—as you might not have been aware. I know how you detest death and the idea that it can be entered with any kind of grace or austerity.  

Farther and farther dad ventured into the realm of the departed, passing by the opulent and poor alike, until he reached the end of the chamber. He turned to his right, and entered the final vault of that side—the resting place of some old aunt who died like a hundred years before our births. Deeply intrigued—since he’d never spoken about her, at least not to me—I crept closer, and hid myself in the opposite chamber—virtually invisible in the omnipresent darkness.  

I saw father draw out the casket, a simple, unblemished thing; the old wood’s sheen preserved by some kind of lacquer. Father struggled with the coffin, and I almost rushed out to help him, knowing how his back sometimes gives him trouble. But I refrained, still fairly unnerved by the grim impression I’d received earlier. And, a little foolishly, I feared that someone *else* might detect my presence, if not him.  

In a surprising display of strength (given his self-admitted “dismissal of youth”) he then broke open the casket, revealing the dry, decayed, though elegantly dressed corpse of that woman. Initially, I felt a sudden sense of relief, because I thought that he’d simply come to rob the woman; around her neck was a jeweled necklace, and the buttons of her burial garments seemed pretty fancy, too. But then I wondered why he’d need such things, since he hadn’t ever mentioned us hurting, financially; and anyway, mom of course has plenty of jewelry she doesn’t need and wouldn’t miss—if jewels alone were his goal.  

Then dad did something that completely dismissed this conjecture—he withdrew a small hand saw from his coat, and savagely and unceremoniously decapitated the woman’s corpse.  

I don’t know how I managed to keep quiet. The sound of the saw’s teeth as it cut through the papery, desiccated flesh; the final tearing of a stubborn flap of skin as he pried the head from her neck. It was terrible, grisly, gruesome stuff. Had I not been so shocked, so speechlessly appalled, I probably would’ve vomited and then fainted right there. But I somehow kept enough composure to simply watch, stunned beyond sense; reeling with horror.  

Upon securing the head in a bag he’d brought (which he’d also withdrawn from his very accommodating coat) he returned the casket to its shelf in the vault, dusted himself off, and exited the chamber. I waited several minutes before following, mostly because I couldn’t stand—petrified as I was by my dad’s unspeakable deed.  

Eventually, I rose and stumbled out, all the while feeling as if I’d been personally betrayed; as if he had taken my own head from my shoulders. I hadn’t ever met the woman, hadn’t ever thought about her before that night; but standing in the pale light of the moon outside the mausoleum, I felt a deep, sepulchral kinship with her. And found myself—suddenly and powerfully—hating my father for what he’d done. No one, however hated, deserved such posthumous defilement.  

I wanted to expose him crimes, at least to the family; but by the time I returned home a calmness had settled over me, and I decided to at least confront him first before going to my mother. But a sudden and pervasive tiredness fell over me upon reaching the top of the steps, and I figured that the confrontation could wait until the morning; sleepily thinking to myself that the delay would also give me time to figure out how best to broach the subject—since I’d technically violated two major rules in following him: to never go out at night unaccompanied, and to never enter the necropolis without the escort of the grave-tender. You of course hadn’t stirred a bit in my absence. Resolved, I climbed into bed without issue.  

The next morning, I woke up to my old dad’s face peering over me—*studying* me intently. Startled, remembering all too well the events that had transpired the night before, I asked what he was doing; not at all hiding my fright. But he didn’t notice it, and simply said, “Before she passed—God rest her soul—your grandmother always said that you’d grow to be the spitting image, or I guess the male inverse, of your aunt—specifically in stature...whatever that means. I’m just seeing how things are coming along, is all.”  

Unsure of how to respond, I just stammered out, “Okay...”, and after another awkward, discomforting moment, he withdrew back a bit, mumbled that breakfast was ready, and left the room. You, naturally, had slept through the entire interaction; only waking up when I whispered the word “breakfast” into your ear.  

I should’ve gone straight to mother, then. The implications, however unthinkable, of our father’s words and actions warranted the exposure of his nocturnal activity. But upon heading downstairs and entering the kitchen, I saw our parents happy, the very image of rosy matrimony and parental joy; and I lost all my nerve—couldn't bring myself to spoil the morning with such terrible news.  

So, I kept my mouth shut, and ate my breakfast beside you.   

And on three separate nights over the course of two weeks, I spied our father dashing out into the darkness toward the burial grounds; and returning, an hour or two later, bearing a burden, concealed beneath his heavy coat. I never followed him again; knew I wouldn’t have the stomach for it. But as if my brain had been rewired to awaken at the right time, I woke up always just when dad was leaving the house; and stayed awake until he returned.  

I never confronted him. Never found out the ultimate purpose of his desecrations. One day, they simply stopped, and I eventually forgot about them—until now, at your prompting. This is the only “spooky story” I can provide for your journal, brother. I hope it’s to your liking—it's certainly kept me up at night. 

**End--**

That’s the story uncle told my dad when they were around sixteen years old, a story my dad faithfully copied into his journal of family tales, which he’d started several years prior. There’ve since been many others, but that one always stood out to me, because my dad named me after that (now headless) aunt. Dad has even said that I resemble her, as if in taking her namesake I’ve adopted some aspect of her likeness. I wouldn’t know—I've never seen a picture of the woman. One of the quirks or oddities about my family is that we don’t really take pictures—at least not willingly, for any commemorative or celebratory purpose. Pictures have been taken of us, by others outside the family, but I’ve never seen any of them; and I don’t think they’ve been put to any flattering use, either.  

Another reason I bring up that particular story now, is because I’ve recently noticed my dad carrying out the same sepulchral tasks. I haven’t yet mustered the courage to follow him out to the crypts, but considering the context of the story and the similarities between his behavior and my grandfather’s, it’s obvious what he’s doing. I actually asked him why—but, I have an idea; even though it’s a very insane and scientifically inexplicable.  

I’ve spent so much time talking about others, about my family, but I haven’t really mentioned anything about myself. 

Like my father, I am very sick—fatally, I might even go so far as to say. I’ve been this way for as long as I can remember, which is about two years. I have no memory of a “childhood”, so to speak, but I have memories.... though not all of them are my own. . But I nonetheless feel my body rapidly deteriorating as the days go by, as if I’ve been alive for years, ages—*generations.* Parts of me have literally withered away or even fallen off. My father says that I will not die, that my condition will “stabilize”; but it wasn’t until yesterday that I believed his words. And this belief, brought on by the telling of that dreadful story, sickens me with its potential for truthfulness—disturbs me beyond measure with the likelihood that I *will* continue on, will persist, **in some fashion.**  

Because I know, have unfortunately figured out, the connection between my father’s charnel plundering, and my anticipated—though logically impossible—rejuvenation. I’m also pretty sure I now understand why I have no memories of my childhood, despite having the body of a young (albeit enfeebled) man in his early twenties.  

I have no memories of my childhood because I was never a child—was never *born.*  

I believe I was constructed, built, gruesomely pieced together from the remains of corpses; recompiled into a new person, bearing the masculine likeness (and fragmented memories) of a genealogically far-flung aunt. Necromantically endowed with life (for what other way could I have been given it?) and treated as a natural-born son. *Adopted by my father, but the spawn of a corpse.* 

I am a thing, a fabrication of life; a sapient homunculus, forever doomed to undeath—for what? I do not know the source of my father’s sickness; as far as I can tell, his is of a respiratory variety, unlike my affliction, which plagues every facet of my being. Surely, he is alive, in the traditional, natural sense. He could have fathered an actual son, of his own flesh and blood. My mother is healthy, and has shown only love to him—in front of me, at least. So why go through the effort, why subject yourself to the sacrilege and moral decay, to build a false child of rot -- dead flesh animated for a time, but destined to decompose? 

It’s a question I don’t have the stomach to ask—with my digestive system failing me, I don’t have the stomach for much, these days. Maybe, if I am truly restored a state resembling proper life, I’ll ask him; but for now, while I await this miraculous renewal, I figured I’d share a little about myself, and my family

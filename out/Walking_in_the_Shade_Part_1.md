I believe I'm a normal woman.

Nothing too remarkable. Brown eyes flecked with gold, deep brown mahogany hair. 22 years old. Not in a relationship. But this is the story of how I went from a rambunctious young party animal to a cold, isolated, paranoid recluse.

It was a nice day out. A light sprinkle of rain, pierced occasionally by golden beams of sunlight. My silver tabby, Creek, was sitting on my lap and sleeping as I read a romance/horror novel. Creek must have been sleeping well, he was purring softly and flicking his tail.

I took a moment to glance up, noticing the sun was falling as it surrendered to the violet rays of dusk, creeping dark fingers of shadows of my beautiful lodge, three minute drive to the town. I shut my book, slipping a laminated bookmark into my page. Page 253.

I gently prodded my cat's head, stroking it as he blinked open his sky-blue eyes and blinked at me gratefully. He leapt off my lap, padding off somewhere. Most likely to his bed. I bounced to my room, a comforting small room. You couldn't see the butter-yellow walls through the posters of rock bands, cats doing stuff, ect.

I switched off the lights, jumping onto my springy bed and pulling out my iPhone to check my texts.

*Notification from* [*Bobcat.boy2664@Gmail.com*](mailto:Bobcat.boy2664@Gmail.com)*.*

*BB: Hey, you still coming to the library?*

*ME: You bet! I'll bring the coffee, you bring the notebooks.*

*BB: Sounds great, seeya there.*

I smiled, shutting down my phone. I had to get some rest, I was getting up early to study my biology textbook with Johnathan at the library. Closing my eyes, I began to drift off. Falling into the soft silver fabric of sleep, my last thoughts were of Johnathan's eyes.

In my dreams, I was walking though the heavy double doors of the library. Something was off; a still, cold morning, despite it being the middle of summer. No cars in the parking lot, no problem. Maybe the staff were parked in the back. Clutching my coffee mugs, I strode in. No Librarian. Maybe they were busy with someone?

Growing steadily more uneasy, I strode towards the corner infested wit beanbags where me and Johnathan liked to study. Another thing was off. Johnathan wasn't there. No matter, maybe the bus was just late. I settled down in my favorite squishy crimson beanbag, picking up my double-chocolate mocha from Dutch Bros and sipping it. Perfect. I grinned as I saw Johnathan speeding towards me. Now something was off.

You wanna know what?

A bloodstained knife was in his hand.

I closed my mocha lid, setting it down and blinking at Johnathan.

"Hey, John?"

No response.

"John, slow down... This isn't funny..."

His green eyes were locked onto mine, as he began to walk faster. Nope. Nope nope nope nope.

I chucked my cup at him, bolting away from the corner. I had no idea where to go. Then I spotted the women's bathroom. Sprinting in as fast as I could, weaving through racks of books. I shut myself into a stall, locking the door to the bathroom and shutting myself into a stall. I heard banging coming from the door, glancing around frantically before I noticed something. Sitting atop the ledge of the stall was my beloved cat, Creek. He stared at me, before standing and walking to a vent in the side of the wall. I gasped, climbing up and yanking off the loose grate. Right after I closed it up again, the door broke down. Just as he entered, I was awoken.

Creek was sitting on my chest, prodding my head. Misty sunlight washed through my room, bathing the nice little space in a glittering web of gold. I sighed, getting up and stalking to the living room. I decided not to go the the library, despite what I had told Johnathan. After giving Creek his feather toy he had been waiting patiently for, I logged onto my chromebook and began jotting down notes. About halfway through, I decided it was quiet and decided to switch on the news.

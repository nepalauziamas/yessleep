I can't say I know much about this. We never found out what it was.  


Around 8PM, typical time for 6 year old me to be in my bedroom, me and my sister, along with her friend who we will call Bri, decided that we were gonna use the ouija board that had gained dust over the past 2 years or so.   


Bri had suggested the idea. "We should do a ritual!" she had said with some flare in her eyes, determined to be the one not chickening out. My sister had full-heartedly agreed to the idea, she really just wanted me to be scared enough to the point I would leave them alone. Well, I wouldn't.  


We had collected candles from my skeptical mom, we wanted to try Bloody Mary first. We went into our bathroom and my sister put some candles down on the bathroom counter. She yelled that we had to do it one at a time, and that immediately made me shiver. Of course, I was first.  


"Bloody Mary," I spun and close my eyes. "Bloody Mary," all I could see was the pitch black with a tint of red from my tightly shut eyes. "Bloody Mary."  


I fumbled to turn on the lights, and as I had presumed, nothing bad happened.  


I walked out of the bathroom all confident as they had their one-on-one dance with death. We all came out unscathed.   


We decided against anything else, and my sister pulled out the ouija. She blew on it to get some of the dust off, and rubbed the rest. Bri, my sister, and I put our index and middle fingers on the planchette. Bri said something like, "Is anyone there?"  


The planchette had moved to no, which we all thought was fucking hysterical.  


"Okay Mr. Nobody, are you a good or bad spirit?"   


It slid across the board, eventually spelling bad. "Haha, real funny," my high pitch voice squeaked. I was sure my sister had moved it to be 'spooky.' I don't know if anyone did, I never found that out either.  


We continued on, nothing too bad, just them saying they'll kill us and send us a sign tomorrow. No biggie, because obviously, I'm not dead. Neither is my sister or Bri.  


We put it away, throwing it into the closet to dust again for the rest of its life. Bri had sat down on the bottom bunk with my sister, and eventually had gone to sleep.  


I looked up at my Strawberry Shortcake clock, and realized it was far past my bedtime. It was 4AM. I was fucking exhausted, and shut my eyes.  


As soon as I woke up, it was noon. Bri had gone home to do some chores, and my sister took my little brother to the library. My mom was asleep downstairs on the couch. After stealing something from the fridge, I started to walk upstairs.  


A lion roar.  


I didn't know what it was, or if it was just my mind. But I panicked anyways. What else could I do?  


We never said 'Goodbye.'

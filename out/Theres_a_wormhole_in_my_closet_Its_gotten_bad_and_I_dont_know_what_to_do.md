I opened my closet to a wormhole the other day. It was generic, like in the movies. Big 4 foot black hole in the middle, with galaxy like purple spirals slowly turning around it. I just stood there, blinking. I rubbed my eyes, but it was still there. I tried waving my hand in it to see if I was hallucinating, but my fingers disappeared as they went into the blackness. "I guess I'm not getting my jacket." I thought. I finished getting ready for work and walked out into the winter air. I'm close to work, a 3 minute walk, so I didn't drive.

I sat in my cubicle, thinking about it. It was hard to focus on working. I ended up my 8 hour shift with a short stack of papers left that I didn't do because I was so distracted. Luckily I was using good with getting things done on time and my boss was cool so I'd be ok. I walked home to my apartment on the second floor and immediately went to my bedroom. I needed to see if I was hallucinating, still. I opened the door and the eerily silent apparition was still there. That was one thing, it was dead silent, which made it less real. I just started for a few seconds, then closed the door.

I just played video games for a few hours and then went to bed. The next day I didn't have work so I was just going to chill all day. But this wormhole was eating away at me. The first thing I did after getting out of bed was opening the door. This time curiosity got the better of me and I decided to step through. When I stepped through the blackness I was facing my open closet door, from the inside of the closet. It was like a mirror. I took a couple steps into my room, then turned around. The purple spirals we're now red. I looked around and everything was good. Nothing different. Weird. I went to the computer and turned it on. That's when things went south. And fast. Everything on the computer with writing was flipped, like I was reading it through a mirror. I sat there bewildered for a second, then I got up and went to the kitchen to look at a Calender to check the words on that too. Flipped.

"No biggie," I thought, "just go back through." So I went back to the bedroom and stepped through, with the same mirrored thing happening. But this time the spirals we're bright banana yellow. "Uh, oh no." I said to myself. The computer was still on, but this time both text was mirrored, and the wallpaper was flipped too. Now I started to panic. This time I ran through. Now the entire bedroom was mirrored on top of everything. I ran out of the room, not paying attention to the new color. My whole apartment was flipped.

So long story short, I kept running through, the color changing each time. Now the flipping has gotten to bad I'm walking around on the ceiling. I managed to figure out my phone, to make this post and call for help. If anyone has any idea of what to do, I would appreciate it. I'm afraid to go back through. And I would have to climb into the closet now. And I am afraid to go outside because I'm worried that I'll fall into the sky. What should I do guys?

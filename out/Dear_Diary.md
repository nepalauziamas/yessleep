Dear diary, 

It’s March 23rd. I’ve moved into the new apartment building on Maple Ave.

It’s a small, over priced place that’s “close to the market” if you have a car. Getting food is going to have to wait so I’ll probably call a pizza place or something for now. Hopefully there’s somewhere with stuffed crust.

After the furniture arrives I might have a decent looking place! I hate that I had to rebuy everything I owned. I miss my bed, but I know I’d never even think about sleeping in it again. I hope the bed arrives soon, I really don’t want to have to sleep on the floor for months because of some shipping issue or something like that.

I don’t know how excited I can get about this place though…I just hope it doesn’t start back up again. I don’t know where I’ll go if it does, church??? I don’t know, but at least I still have the number. Just thinking about having to call again reminds me of sitting in the dark room, the scratching, the sounds…th-no I can’t. Even here doesn’t feel safe enough. If I let myself freak out now I probably won’t stop for months!

Everybody says that I should try to just forget about it. That I should just move on. As if it’s something you can do voluntarily.

I guess I should end this here, always so weird, writing in a book like it understands you…maybe it can and maybe not either way it’s good therapy. At least according to my therapist.

Feeling silly,

Dear diary,

It’s March 26th. I was supposed to write in this daily but moving all the furniture in and unpacking is exhausting. Plus I had to buy groceries and deal with the public transportation FOR THE FIRST TIME! And I really wish it’s the last because I’m sure someone swiped something from one of my bags. Then I had to put the furniture together, and-wait…

Why am I making excuses to a book? 

The nightmares are still bad. The only thing that helps is the fact that I’m far away from it all. At least physically. Mentally the flashbacks are constantly triggered by the smallest things. I started crying when the fridge made ice because the sound was so similar. The neighbors used a blender the other day and I pulled out my knife and was looking around the room wildly before it clicked where I was. 

I keep remembering the things face pressed against the window, drool going down it’s cracked lips that were firmly pressed in a smile. It was a smile that made you wish the damn thing was growling instead. The sharp taps on the glass, slow and mocking. Like it was completely aware of how easily that glass between us could break.

I’m not supposed to talk about it this much but hey, therapy right? As long as there’s some improvement the doc can’t be too fussy about how right?

After all, I’m the one paying them so they’ll have to help if they want more money. 

Anyways I think this is where I should leave it

Feeling jumpy

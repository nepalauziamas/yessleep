The most amazing thing happened to me several weeks ago, I just have to tell *someone* about it. But up until today I've kept it to myself because I'm worried that not everyone will understand and share my joy when they hear about it. Then I thought, maybe *you* could. And I've also decided that rather than writing it all down again, I'm just going to cut-and-paste my diary entries from that week. That week in my life that changed everything. 

**May 9, 2022**

Dear Diary — Something strange is happening to me. It actually started yesterday, but I didn’t mention it then because it didn’t seem like a very big deal at the time. I just figured it would go away. Today it seems like more of a big deal.

Yesterday morning when I got undressed to take a shower, I noticed a line about two inches above my bellybutton. A horizontal line maybe three inches wide, kinda like a sideways dimple. It was really faint, and I thought it was just a line caused by a wrinkle in my sheets since I sleep on my stomach sometimes. I didn’t think much about it except that it was a little sensitive in the shower when I was washing.

I probably would have forgotten all about it except that this morning, it was still there, and it was more noticeable. It isn’t any bigger or anything, but it isn’t as faint as it was yesterday. Yesterday it was nearly invisible, but today it’s pinker. And it’s still sensitive. It doesn’t hurt or anything. It’s almost like it tickles a little.

Maybe this is normal? I don’t know. I’m not as tall as the other girls in my class. And I don’t want to ask mom about it. Asking mom about body stuff is embarrassing. I could ask Aunt Lynn. She’d be honest with me without embarrassing me. Maybe I will next time I see her. If it’s still there.

Anyway, I don’t really have much else to say about today. School was okay, I guess. Another one of those watch-the-clock days. At least Jasmine and her posse didn’t make fun of me today. At least, not that I noticed. Who knows what happens when I’m not looking.

Mom made mac and cheese and hot dogs for dinner. She apologized that she didn’t have time to make anything more special than that, but I didn’t care. It was still yummy. Homework was as boring as school had been, but I was done with it by seven-ish. Then I brought up some old episodes of *American Idol* on my laptop and watched that for awhile. I love that show.

 Mom made me shut it off and go to bed at ten. I wonder how many other 12-year-old girls have 10 o’clock bedtimes? Not many. So now I’m under the covers writing to you all about my boring day. Aren’t you glad? *Yawn*. I’m sleepy.

**May 10, 2022**

Dear Diary — I hate Jasmine Long. And Taylor Muncin. And Jamie Peterson. Hate them hate them hate them. With the fury of a thousand suns! You know that already. But it bears repeating, as Granny used to say whenever she’d tell me an old story for the umpteenth time.

Mrs. Dulaney made us all get up in front of the class today. I hate her too. OK, not really, I like her a lot, but there should be some kind of law against making students get up in front of class without at least two days’ advanced notice. In writing. Anyways, Mrs. Dulaney asked us all to get up one at a time to tell the class about what we would like to do when we grow up and why.

She picked me to go first, so I didn’t really have time to think about my answer at all. I never get picked first for anything *good*, of course. If this had been the lottery or something, it wouldn’t have been my name picked, I can tell you that. So since I didn’t really have time to think about it, I chose the first thing that popped into my head: I told the class that I wanted to win *American Idol*.

Most of the kids just stared at me with blank faces. But you should have seen the smile on Jasmine’s face. She was absolutely delighted, and not in a nice way. She of course looked over at Taylor and Jamie and the three of them just about fell out of their chairs they were laughing so hard. Mrs. Dulaney of course quickly told them to cut it out, and they did. But even Mrs. Dulaney looked at me with something like pity on her face. So did some of the other kids.

What was so ridiculous about it? Who’s to say I couldn’t win it? Some of the other girls had ridiculous ideas for their futures too, like fashion model, Olympic athlete, President of the United States, and I didn’t laugh, even though Becky isn’t that pretty, Lisa isn’t that athletic, and Jasmine is *definitely* not that smart. President my *tuckus*.

I told mom about it while we were eating dinner. She didn’t really react much, except that she also had pity in her eyes just like Mrs. Dulaney did. But I couldn’t tell if she pitied me because the girls had laughed or because she thinks my *American Idol* dream is stupid too. I decided not to ask her which one it was.

When I was getting ready for bed tonight, I looked at the line on my stomach again. It’s darker now — a little more red than pink, and the crease is getting deeper. It looks like a cut that’s healing. It still doesn’t hurt at all, but I don’t like to touch it. It’s really sensitive.

**May 11, 2022**

Dear Diary — *ugh,* my life!

Mrs. Dulaney gave us a writing assignment today. Two hundred and fifty words on what we most like to do for fun. I wish I could have thought of something else to write about. I even thought about lying and saying that I enjoy planting flowers with my mom or something, even though we live in an apartment and I’ve never planted a flower in my life, but there’s no way I could have come up with 250 words to write about *that*.

So I wrote about how I like to watch *American Idol*. If this was something that was going to be shared with the class, I would have forced myself to come up with something else – *anything else* – to write about. But since I knew only Mrs. Dulaney would see it, I thought I was safe. She would understand.

She graded the papers during lunch, and when I got it back from her, she had given me a B+, and across the top she had written, “Maybe come up with a different topic next time?” The question mark at the end bugged me, like she was shrugging or something. So passive-aggressive. And even though she hadn’t marked anything wrong on the essay itself, she’d given me a B+ just because of the topic I’d chosen.

I showed it to mom when I got home from school. Slapped it down on the counter in front of her and crossed my arms. She read the whole thing, and then she had that sad look on her face again. When she finished, she gave it back to me and asked me, “Sarah, why do you like that show so much?”

Lots of reasons, I told her. It’s fun, it’s colorful, it’s exciting, and it’s full of energy. But the main reason I love it is because of the way the singers look when they’re performing. They look so *happy*. Not, “yay it’s my birthday” happy or “oh boy we’re getting ice cream” happy, but like they’ve been transported somewhere else, somewhere magical. Singing is like an act of pure bliss for them. It makes me smile. I think music must actually have some magic in it. It’s mysterious that way.

I could tell that mom was trying to understand my answer, and she did nod and smile at me as I explained it to her as best I could, but that look of pity never quite left her face. I get it, she thinks I’m obsessing over something that’s outside my reach. I think she’s wrong. Then she told me that Aunt Lynn once said that all the songs on that show are rubbish.

As I was changing for bed tonight, I looked at the line on my stomach again. I was surprised by how dark and thick it is now. And the line in the middle of it all now looks like a fresh cut, except that there is no blood. Maybe I should show it to mom. But it doesn’t hurt, and she would probably make me go to the doctor. I hate going to the doctor. Going to the doctor is worse than going to school. One or two more days, and if it doesn’t get better, I’ll show her then. Maybe.

**May 12, 2022**

Dear Diary — What a strange day this was.

This morning before I got in the shower, I was looking at that line again above my bellybutton. I want to call it a gash, but that makes it sound like a wound or something, and I don’t think it’s a wound. Plus I hate that word. *Gash*. If I touch it lightly, it feels ok. Sensitive, but not painful. Anyway, I was looking at it in the mirror, and I pinched it a little. The hot water was running in the shower and the mirror had started to get steamy, so I didn’t have a real clear view of it. It kind of puckered out when I did it. It tickled a little. But then I did the opposite and pulled my two pinching fingers apart, and the gash split wide open.

Diary, I kid you not, I almost fainted. Like, I seriously had to grab the bathroom counter because my knees got weak and my head got swimmy and suddenly the air felt really hot. It was hard to breathe. After a couple of seconds I felt okay again, and looked at my stomach. The gash was open, but it wasn’t bleeding or oozing or anything like that. It was just open. There was nothing but darkness behind it. I thought about getting my phone and shining a light into it, but I quickly decided I didn’t really want to see what was in there.

I took a shower but I didn’t wash my stomach. I was afraid the soap would sting it. When I was done, I got dressed and told my mom I wasn’t feeling well. I said I felt dizzy and queasy, which wasn’t completely untrue. She said my forehead did feel a bit warm (even though that was probably from the shower), and she said I could stay home from school if I wanted to. I told her wanted to.

After mom left, I stood in front of the mirror for a while and studied my reflection. I would use my fingers to open the gash, and then it would slowly close on its own. It didn’t make me queasy anymore. It made me curious.

Eventually I got bored with it. Plus I felt really, really thirsty. I went to the fridge where I saw a six pack of bottles of Orange Crush. Mom’s favorite. She lets me have one once in a while, and I was sure she would understand if I told her I’d felt nauseous and needed something bubbly to make my stomach feel better. So I figured she wouldn’t mind if I had one.

I drank about half of it. It tasted cold and sweet and delicious, but for some reason I still felt *really* thirsty. Like, out too long on a hot summer day thirsty. It was strange. It reminded me of the time Aunt Lynn took me to Disneyland and she didn’t want to buy me a drink because they’re so expensive. She finally gave in because it was so hot I thought I’d die of thirst. That was the best $8 soda I’d ever had in my life. Saved my life, I tell you.

Anyway, I don’t know why I did what I did next. It just happened. Right there in the kitchen I lifted up my shirt and put the lip of the bottle against my stomach. I pushed it in a little. Then the gash opened up on its own and immediately just sucked it right in. I took a step backwards and ran into the refrigerator door, it surprised me so much. But the gash had latched onto the bottle and – I kid you not – it was *sucking* on it.

It took me a moment to accept what I was seeing. Eventually I tipped the bottle upward and let the soda flow out of the bottle until it had emptied into the gash. It stopped sucking once the bottle was empty. I wasn’t as thirsty then, but I still wanted more. I emptied two more bottles. Some of it I drank the normal way, but most of it went into the opening in my stomach.

I probably should have been scared, but I wasn’t. I was *exhilarated*. I had this tremendous burst of energy, Diary. I wanted to run around the apartment and do cartwheels. It was really strange but really great.

So I went to my room, grabbed my laptop, set it on the dresser, and opened up YouTube. I found a Kelly Clarkson video and pressed play. Then I hit the volume button on my keyboard until the marker was all the way up to the right. Hairbrush in hand, I pretended I was singing along. The volume was so loud that it was actually vibrating my dresser, making my reflection shudder to the drum beat while I danced. I could even feel it through the floor. I was having a blast, moving to the rhythm.

When the song I was over, I was breathless from dancing. I looked down and saw that my phone had lit up. I had a text from mom: “Are you playing music?!” it said. “Two of the neighbors have texted me to complain about noise.”

I was embarrassed, even though nobody could see me. I slammed the laptop shut and slumped down on the bed. My pretend audition was over. I texted mom back, “No, that wasn’t me.” I tossed my phone aside.

Just then, I felt a vibration. It was coming from my stomach. I fell back onto my bed and placed both hands under my shirt, covering the gash. It was moving, vibrating, pulsating. 

Alive.

**May 13, 2022**

Dear Diary — Have I mentioned how much I hate Jasmine Long? Just making sure you’re aware.

Today I was walking down the hallway between classes, and there she was. She and her cronies. As I got near them, Jasmine put one fist up to her mouth like she was holding a microphone, then she jabbed one finger in her ear and pantomimed singing dramatically, her eyes closed and her mouth wide. Taylor and Jamie just about died laughing and the three of them stared at me while I walked by.

I don’t know why they think they’re so much better than everybody else. Sure, they’re all pretty, and Jasmine is taller than all the other girls. She gets lots of attention from the boys. But we’re all in here for the same reason. They’re no better than I am on the outside.

I told mom about it while we were having dinner tonight. She said that girls can be mean, and that she used to get teased a lot for being different when she was a little girl. It didn’t really make me feel any better at all. But then she made it worse by suggesting that perhaps I lay off mentioning *American Idol* in school again. It just gives the girls something to make fun of me about.

This made me want to cry. 

Mom told me that I was a very special, very pretty girl (*yeah, yeah, mom, you have to say that*), and that there were a lot of things I was good at. Writing, for instance. She said I was a very good writer and should focus on that. She was trying to be nice.

“Why do I have to be different?” I asked her.

“Because you take after me,” she responded, sadness on her face as well. And she apologized.

But it wasn’t her fault.

“But there is nothing wrong with you, Sarah,” she insisted. “You should always be proud of who you are. And anyone who looks down on you isn’t worth your time.”

We didn’t say anything to each other for a few minutes, and then mom asked me if I might like to go to the mall for an hour or so. This made me happy. We hadn’t been to the mall for a long time. She said I could pick out a new pair of earrings and maybe we could get milkshakes before we came home. So we cleared the table of dishes and left. I skipped to the car.

The mall was busy, even for a Friday night. But it was nice to be out of the apartment and away from school for a little bit. I found a pair of dangly fake-diamond earrings that looked a lot like a pair I’d seen Carrie Underwood wear during her season of *American Idol*. They were $20, so I was surprised mom was willing to buy them. But she did it with a smile. She was trying to make me feel better, and I love her for that.

Then we went to the Food Court for milkshakes. Mom got vanilla and I got strawberry — *yummo!* — and I had to fight the desire to offer the straw to the slit in my stomach. It was thirsty again – hungry, even. I considered ducking into one of the restrooms to let it take a sip. But I decided to resist.

Mom and I were walking through the crowd of shoppers, drinking our shakes, when I felt the gash begin to vibrate again. I put my hand on my stomach and could feel it buzzing. It was even stronger than it had been yesterday. I don’t know whether it was thirsty or what the heck was going on, but the vibration was strong. I could feel it all the way through my arms and legs.

I suggested to mom that maybe we should go home. She smiled and told me that was fine if I was sure I was done shopping. I insisted that I was. She looked disappointed.

As we walked past other shoppers on our way to the mall exit, people started to stare at us. Hard. They weren’t even trying to be subtle about it. I noticed it right away, but it took mom a few moments to realize it herself. She looked puzzled as people walked by us, some of them glaring, some of them confused, some of them looking almost shocked. She looked down at me, confused, trying to figure out what was drawing everyone’s attention.

Mom grabbed my hand and we increased our pace until we were back in the car. We sat there for a moment, not moving and not saying anything to each other. It wasn’t the first time people had stared at us, but they were usually more discreet about it. Tonight was different. It was as if our presence had offended them in some way.

Back at the apartment, I was so upset that I didn’t even remember to bring the little shopping bag containing my new earrings in from the car. When mom tucked me in bed, I pressed my hands firmly on my stomach for fear that the vibrations being made would be visible to her through the covers. But mom didn’t notice. She stroked my forehead for a bit until I got sleepy.

She told me not to let the mall people bother me. People don’t always understand those who are different from them, she said to me. Sometimes they stare without really thinking about it.

As mom was leaving the room, before she shut off the light, her face lit up and said that there was something she had forgotten to tell me. Aunt Lynn is coming over for dinner on Monday night! This made me happy. Aunt Lynn is one of my most favorite people ever. She treats me like a normal person.

**May 16, 2022**

Dear Diary — I’m sorry I didn’t write to you all weekend. There wasn’t much to say. But I do have to tell you that today was the happiest day of my life. You might think it strange for me to say so after I tell you everything that happened — a lot of it really bad and upsetting — but I don’t care. I’m happy like I don’t think I’ve ever been before.

First of all, let me give myself a gold star, because today, I slapped Jasmine Peterson. Not some weak, half-hearted slap, either. I’m talking a full force, hand-stinging slap, one that actually sent her head rolling backward on her neck. I might have given her whiplash. One can only hope.

I think I was still feeling down from what happened at the mall on Friday. Between that and Jasmine’s constant teasing last week, I was on the brink, Diary. When I passed her in the hallway after third period and she started that stupid microphone mime again, the gash in my stomach buzzed like never before. I was like a giant dragonfly had landed under my shirt and was rapidly moving its wings. The sensation was stronger than ever before.

I didn’t even think about it. I marched right up to her. She looked stunned even before I reached out and let her have it. Her head snapped back and her hair went flying. She took a step back and put a hand on her cheek. Taylor and Jamie were so shocked that they just froze on the spot. They didn’t even try to help Jasmine or anything. They just stood there like two mannequins but with their mouths hanging open. It was glorious.

Sure, I got detention. But it was totally worth it. And I only got two days’ worth, which I think was a pretty light sentence. I’m pretty sure Mrs. Delaney was lenient with me because she knew Jasmine had it coming.

Anyway, that’s not even the best part of my day. When I got home from school, mom asked me to set the table, reminding me that Aunt Lynn was coming for dinner. The gash in my stomach continued to buzz and move as I set the table. The apartment was filled with the wonderful smell of mom’s homemade pizza. I danced to a song in my head as I set down the third and final plate.

I went to the bathroom when I was finished. The gash was thirsty. It had been thirsty a lot today. I used a paper cup to give it water. It drained five cups before it was satisfied. I tapped my stomach dry with a towel, and even though it wasn’t thirsty anymore, the opening continued to move, causing vibrations throughout my body as it did so. I wasn’t an entirely unpleasant feeling. It made me want to dance for some reason.

Aunt Lynn arrived while I was still in the bathroom, but I didn’t know she was there until I walked into the living room and saw her with mom. She looked at me and beamed. Aunt Lynn loves me as much as mom does; she always has. She held out her arms and I ran to her and we hugged.

But then, something strange happened. She pushed me away from her, hard. She held me out at arm’s length and looked at me, a really confused and concerned look on her face. Her eyes trailed down to my stomach, which was covered by the sweater I was wearing. I wondered for a moment if perhaps Aunt Lynn had felt the vibration of the gash when she had hugged me, and I was afraid. I crossed my arms over my belly. I didn’t want Aunt Lynn to think I was weird. She had always treated me like a normal person, a normal person just like her. I didn’t want that to change. I didn’t want her to look at me with pity.

She dropped her hands, which had been holding onto my shoulders, took a step away from me, and looked over at my mom. Mom looked confused too, but it was because she didn’t understand what Aunt Lynn was reacting to.

For a moment, all three of us stood still, exchanging confused glances in the living room. Finally my mom raised her hands, and began signing to Aunt Lynn. “What is it?” she asked.

“I don’t understand what’s happening,” Aunt Lynn signed back. “What is that sound?” As she signed, her hands were trembling.

“Sound?” mom responded with her hands, her brows knit in frozen confusion.

Aunt Lynn pointed at me. She looked horrified as she slowly signed, “Sarah… is singing.”

I crossed my arms tighter against my belly. The movement underneath my sweater was incredible, a vibration like I hadn’t felt before. It tickled my forearms. The gash was opening and closing, moving and undulating, buzzing and alive beneath my sweater.

“Singing?” my mother signed back, but Aunt Lynn didn’t see it. She was staring at me, her face a mask of confusion and revulsion. It was a terrible expression. I wanted to look away, but I needed to see what she was going to say next.

“She’s singing,” Aunt Lynn signed, her hands jerking with tension. “Stop it, Sarah. Make it stop. It’s horrible.” She put her hands up to her ears, her eyes pleading with me. She shook her head, trying to reject whatever she was hearing.

I ran from the living room and locked myself in my bedroom. I was breathless, confused. I wanted to cry. 

I lifted my sweater in front of the mirror. The gash in my stomach continued to move, opening and closing, sometimes gaping wide for several seconds at a time, sending ripples across the skin of my belly, and suddenly I understood, if I could only hear it, it wasn’t just moving. It wasn’t just vibrating. Those vibrations were sounds. It was *singing*.

And just like that, my fear and confusion faded to joy. Because, oh, Dear Diary, what a happy day this is. I can sing! I can sing! *I can sing!*

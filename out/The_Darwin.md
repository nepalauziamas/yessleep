Subject #4836

Name: Darwin

Assessment: Top Level Threat

The Darwin species is a creature of unknown origin, though through various civilizations a tale can be connected to it or its kind. Many tales exaggerate its appearance, but more often than not they will get the most obvious details correct. This leads us to believe that the Darwin species has had varying characteristics through history, possibly to adjust to its environment. This would adhere to its capabilities mentioned in the third paragraph of this document. Locating any and all Darwin and elimination of the species is of top priority for the organisation as letting them continue out in the world can cause widespread panic and in most cases, total collapse of towns and even cities it makes its nest within.

Organisation specialists work nonstop, searching the internet for any plausible evidence of Darwin sightings. Once confirmed, a team will be sent to the location to assess if the Darwin has entered its prime state yet. They will then act accordingly to their assessment.\*

Description:

The Darwin species is a humanoid creature with inhuman appearances. All seem to be hairless, albeit its ancestors seemed to have had a small covering of hair. Most Darwins reach a height of thirteen feet tall when entering their prime state, yet most don’t make it that far (the only one on record for the organisation is the one in \[REDACTED\]).

Darwins have elongated arms, usually stretching to be longer than the length of their legs, causing them to drag on the ground at most times. Although Darwins must consistently eat on a nightly basis, it would seem as though they never grow in weight as the time they enter prime state, they all look to be that of a starving human, with their rib cages nearly exposed and their fingers looking boney and frail.

Darwins have an always opened maw that looks broken, full of jagged teeth like broken fangs and more than always they will be letting out a horrendous sound, similar to the laugh of a mad man, but in fact this is their pained howls as the Darwins are constantly growing. When the sound stops, this is a signal that the creature has reached its prime state.

Darwin’s eyes are a flat white, usually bulging from their sockets. They have no lids, which when initially observed we believed this to mean they were blind. However, Darwin’s have proven to see in one way or another, whether it’s through extrasensory means or something we don’t yet understand.

A Darwins neck is also elongated, roughly two feet in length at most times in it’s life cycle. Their head sways and swings as they move, cracking the bones in their neck until their evolutionary trait deemed “the Fix” takes place.

Abilities:

The Darwin has an inhuman strength, with the ability to lift nearly everything we’ve tested on it. The heaviest thing we’ve thrown at a Darwin was a block of obsidian that weighed over 45 tonnes and it grabbed it with one hand. 

Along with the strength, Darwins have inhuman speed. When combining their speed and strength, Darwins have the capability to run through buildings without pause.

Darwins also have an ability called The Fix, which is the ability they get their name from. In 99% of our testings, nothing can kill a Darwin. Plenty of things could hurt it, even mame it, but nothing could cause lethal damage to it. Any form of damage caused to the Darwin would leave its mark, quickly heal, and then it wouldn’t take damage from the same thing after. One Darwin that we had captured in its infant state was shot in the head point blank with a rifle using anti tank rounds. The bullet went through the head leaving a clean hole and stopping the creature in its tracks. Within moments of capture, the hole had disappeared and the creature was even more feral than before. The agent who originally shot it was tasked with doing so again. 

The bullet bounced off of the Darwin and ripped through the agent's sternum, killing him instantly.

Anything a Darwin becomes immune to, these traits will pass on to their young.

On this topic, a Darwin is asexual, needing no partner to reproduce. When they reach their prime stage, a Darwin will find as many random places through its nesting area (usually within the town it resides near) and lay its eggs. The eggs are laid orally, and it is a grotesque scene to witness as its already gaping maw opens even further to lay its young. It will bury the eggs beneath the ground for several weeks before they hatch and are rampant among the town. The babies are instantly hungry and will feed on anything they can find, not needing humans as sustenance until their third week of growth.

&#x200B;

Weaknesses:

As stated above, almost nothing we’ve tested has had any long lasting effects on the Darwin, except for one surefire way to bring it down for long enough to escape being captured by the creature. 

It seems to have an aversion to fire.

One scientist who was testing our prime state Darwin had lit a cigarette in the room with the creature and had noted that as the match struck, the creature backed up and began to cower in the corner, showing the first signs of true fear to something. Further testing on this proved that not only does fire scare the creature, but it actually hurts it; burning the arm of our prime state Darwin had left blackened marks that had never healed. Using heated blades to cut into it’s skin would leave scars; even though the cut itself would head, the burnt flesh would not.

This, we posit, could mean that with enough fire, a Darwin could theoretically be put down. 

* Depending on the assessment of growth in the found Darwin, agents are tasked with Motion 24-cb, or the Clean Bomb. They will lure the creature into town and do whatever they must to damage it enough to put it down. If this fails, a B-52 bomber will be sent overhead to cleanse the location.

Incident Report 1-A

* Date: REDACTED
* Location: REDACTED

Two agents, Smith and Harrison, were tasked with assessing a Darwin sighting in a small town in the province of REDACTED, Canada. Agents put together a strike force to bring with them, each given the information that the creature they were chasing was suspected of being more rampant than their previous encounters. Any and all flame-creating items were removed from the team before departure, and each was told to distract, not hurt.

Upon entering the town, the force immediately saw that the creature had run wild. Homes were torn in half, people were rioting wherever possible. Coffins were half buried along the backroads for some people. Others still lay where the creature left them. An audio-visual feed was sent to us from the agents at all times. What followed was the last recording they had transmitted.

\[Three of the agents are standing on a street corner, It is late at night, according to the feed’s HUD it is just past midnight. Smoke can be seen in the backgrounds of each feed. This is believed to be fires created by those who lost their loved ones, as they had nowhere left to bury anyone.\]

Agent Smith: Fuck, I wish this thing would just show itself already. Three days in this bootfuck of a town got me sent up the wall.

Agent Harrison: Tell me about it. Tried to bum a smoke off of some of the locals and they fuckin’ pelted me with a rock.

Agent Smith \[Laughing\]: So that’s where that shiner came from? Should’ve shot the fuckin’ moose humpin’ fucks where they stood and called it a day.

Agent Harrison: Don’t get me started. Took every ounce in me not to start firing.

\[Agent Smith raises his cellphone to Agent Harrison\]

Agent Smith: Man, you gotta read this when I’m done. Some dude was uploading stories from Site 34, y’know that town we bombed down in REDACTED? Apparently he kept a log of his encounters with the Darwin. He called it T[he Gangly Man](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/vn2t3o/the_gangly_man/), what a fuckin’ name. Guy put up a pretty good fight against the fucking thing. Took it down himself just before we bombed the place. Says he met Logan.

Agent Harrison: Y’don’t say? Yeah, let me know when you’re done, I’d love to hear that guys story. Too bad we sent him on a one way trip to the pearly gates.

Task Force Member #1: Agents, we ain’t alone no more.

Agent Smith: The fuck you me-

\[Agent Smith’s feed cuts out. From The task force member’s feed we see an elongated hand protruding through Smith’s chest, coming from somewhere behind him in the dark. The task force member changes his camera to night vision and we get our first view of the Darwin. This one is the tallest one we’ve ever seen to date. It looks to be roughly twenty feet in height, and its arms an equal length. Its face is scarred and darkened, we theorise this to be from the townsfolk who had come across it. The creature is motionless, silent., It’s hand slithers out of Agent Smith’s chest as he falls to the ground.\]

Agent Harrison: Soldier, when I say fire, you-

\[Feed shows Task Force Member fleeing the scene before he is lifted into the sky. Harrison’s feed shows the Darwin’s arm reach out and grab the soldier by his head and lift him up, The sound of the soldier screaming peaks our audio receiver before the sound is stopped with a crushing sound. The soldier falls to the ground in a rain of blood, headless. Agent Harrison remains vigilant, staring down the creature as it’s face slithers down to his eye level. His feed shows us that the creature is completely eyeless, and it’s bottom jaw is swaying back and forth, revealing sharp, sickly looking teeth.\]

Agent Harrison (Whispering): Guys, lock on to my position and prepare to drop the hot ones. Harrison out.

\[Agent Harrison lifts his rifle to the creature and fires. The Darwin lets out a blood curdling scream that destroys the microphone in Harrison’s device. The last thing the feed shows is the Darwin’s face lunging towards the camera, smiling nearly from ear to ear.\]

The location was bombed only a half hour later.

Call me Whistleblower. This document was sealed tight by the organisation, along with the rest of their knowledge on other creatures out there. I fear they have something else planned, something bigger. 

I don’t know what it is, but there’s something about Site 34 that they’re not telling us about, either. After the bombing, I saw soldiers carrying in two body bags. One hadn’t seemed odd, only that they were bringing it here. The other one though…it was too long. Inhumanly long. 

Whatever this is, it’s something none of us could be prepared for. 

I will release more files if I’m able to, but even getting this one out to the public is putting me in danger. 

Please, read it over. If you’ve seen anything strange that resembles this creature, avoid it. And if you can’t, well, hopefully this document will aid your survival. 

May God have mercy on us all.

I love to take walks through my local park. It calms me down. I usually do it during the night when everyone is home and the streets are empty. I can walk for miles and not get tired. But as winter was rolling in I started taking shorter walks. As I usually do. One night something happened. Something weird. 

I entered the park and started walking down the steps, taking in the smells and sounds. It rained earlier in the day so everything was muddy and wet. It was just me and one other lady. She didn't stay long before leaving me alone in the park. I took the route I usually take and while walking I thought about what I did during the day. 

As I was walking, I heard something behind me. I stopped and turned around and, nothing. I figured it was nothing so I walked on. Again I heard something and it sounded like footsteps. I turned around and no one was there. At this point, it was completely dark. I stood there waiting. Waiting to see who or what is following me. I turned around again, now walking faster. 

I got to the back entrance of the park. I took my phone out and called my brother telling him about what just happened. He picked me up and took me home. I didn't do anything about it because I figured it was just all in my mind. A few days went by and I forgot about the whole park ordeal. One of my friends left his dog with me to look after. So one night I went for a walk with the dog.

We went to the park. While we walked down the path something snapped in the trees next to us. The dog, that's not on a leash, went bolting between the trees into the darkness. I stood there not knowing what to do. After a few seconds, I gathered all my courage and went after the dog. I stumbled over things while calling out the dog's name. I found him whimpering in a small clearing. 

I crouched next to him, feeling him over to see if he was hurt. Then, I heard something behind me. I turned around to see someone standing behind me. I was frozen in place. My mind was racing. It was too dark to see who it was. Adrenaline started rushing through me. I picked the dog up and bolted through the trees. While running I could hear the unknown person running behind me. 

I got to the steps at the entrance of the park. Almost slipping and falling. I got to a house near the park and started knocking on the front door. A lady opened up and I tried to tell her everything. After some explaining, she called the cops. They asked me a few questions and after they went to the park, looking for the unknown person. They didn't find anyone so they told me to just call them if anything happens again. 

My friend came by the next day to pick up his dog. He was shocked to hear what happened. After that day I never went to that park again during the night.

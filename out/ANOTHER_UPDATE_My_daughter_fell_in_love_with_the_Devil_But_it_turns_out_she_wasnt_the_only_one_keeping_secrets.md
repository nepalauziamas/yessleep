Confession time. 

My daughter Katie is dead, and I knew it was going to happen. 
Or at the very least, I felt that it was inevitable. 

A few months ago, she tried to take her life. And that’s my fault. I haven’t been a very good father to her… and I have been relying too much on her mom to handle these teenage bouts of depression. 

Seeing her nearly dead on the bathroom floor should have been a wake up call… but…

Well let me explain a few things. 

First off, I am not Katie’s biological father. She never really had a dad in her life, so I took the role on when I met Beth almost five years ago. 

I thought that I was doing a good job. Katie even called me dad. I was trying my best to not be too pushy and Beth told me that she would eventually warm up to me. 

Beth told me a lot of things. 

Last friday, I woke to [hear screams](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/vuf04d/update_my_daughters_secret_admirer_is_the_devil/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) and ran into the bathroom and saw that she was frantically wiping away at the mirror. Something had been written there. 

All I saw was a single word. SINS. And I asked what was wrong. 

“Garret. I shouldn’t have done it. I wrote back to her… I needed to know… I’m so sorry,” she whispered. 

The letter we found had stated that Katie viewed us as responsible for what had happened… at least that’s what I thought at first. 

As Beth came into the bedroom with me, her fingers trembling, I realized that there was something more than just our daughter’s death that was bothering her. 

“Garret… I have to tell you something that I haven’t told anyone,” she said, trying to contain her fears. 

I held her hands and looked into her soft green eyes. 

“Whatever it is, we can handle this together, I’m sure,” I told her. 

“It’s about… Katie’s dad. Her real dad. He’s… he’s dead,” she explained. I have 

I stayed silent as she continued with a story that chilled me to the bone. 

“My first husband… he was a monster. A real devil more so than the one that Katie fell for. He would beat me. On a regular basis. And Katie too. Do you remember how often she would have to go to the hospital for issues? It’s because of what her dad did when she was little… she doesn’t remember any of it…. I made sure she didn’t,” Beth said looking blandly toward the wall. 

“You killed him,” I guessed. She only nodded, too frightened to even speak the words. 

I was trying to find a way to reassure her. I wasn’t mad. Actually I was angry at the thought that this woman I loved had been abused so regularly and I hadn’t been there to protect her. 

“Why haven’t you ever told me this?“ I asked. 

“When we met I tried. But things were so good. And Katie seemed happy at first. Everything was fine… I wanted it to stay that way. I figured that if enough time passed it would just be an ugly memory,” she admitted to me. 

“So when you wrote back… you think that now Katie is going to exact some revenge for what you did to her dad?” I asked, referring to the letters on the bathroom wall. 

“It’s the first thing I thought of. I wanted to make amends… tell her I was sorry for everything that happened. But I’m not sure she will listen. Garrett I think she wants us to suffer,” Beth admitted. 

She looked down at the floor and whispered, “Maybe since we failed her it’s what we deserve.” 

I thought about all the times that Katie had been distant to us. 

“No; we have tried our best to reconnect with her. Especially after what happened five months ago. It’s the devil, he is the one that came between us. I’m not sure what he did to convince her we are the enemies. But we have to fight back somehow,” I told her. 

“But how? We don’t know anything about demons or stuff like that. And the local churches just thought I was crazy,” Beth said. 

I reminded her that we had already shared our experience with the devil online, as a warning to others of how dangerous this supernatural influence could be. But now I was thinking we could turn to this online community for ideas on battling evil. 

“Let me do some digging. We surely have time otherwise Katie would have already attacked us right?” I asked. 

She nodded, taking some melatonin and trying to sleep. 

I stayed up majority of the night on the internet, trying to learn all that I could about demonology. 

I know it sounds absurd, but I was sure that somewhere I could find the answer we needed. 

Eventually this led to the darker corners, places where gossip and rumor were traded like currency and I saw a few similar stories to the one we were living now. 

I messaged one of the users, who now claimed to be a demon hunter, and told them what we had experienced so far. 

To my surprise, the response came that same night. 

*You are dealing with a new vessel of a lesser devil, not Lucifer himself. It is in fact very rare for the Lord Satan to ever appear here on this plane of existence. But his Princes have a habit of making attachments to humans… especially ones that they view as remarkable. Your daughter must have had qualities that the devil wished to exploit. Secrets they knew would benefit them to turn your entire family to darkness.* 

I risked it, and told them about Katie’s biological father. 

*If he was a bad Man, when the mother killed him his soul went to Hell. But the mistake was murder. It made his spirit linger and grow with hate. The devil fed off of this and it’s likely the devil knew about this before ever targeting your daughter. In other words, you have been part of his plan for quite some time.* 

I asked what was the purpose of all of this suffering, what benefit would it serve. I didn’t like the response but I could tell this hunter was telling the truth. It sucked the air out of the room as I read it. 

*negative energy creates a stronger hold for his power and gives him strength to corrupt others more easily. This bitterness and hate that is festering in your family is the fuel he needed to give him an unlimited fountain of power. He will have your daughter haunt you for as long as her hate is fueled. But something tells me that she is not fully aware of the evil that her father represents.* 

I decided to end the conversation with that, unsure if I could even convince Katie of that. If she was already dragged to Hell, surely she would have seen her biological father there. 

So the question would become, why did she believe the Devil’s version of events? 

The next day, I told Beth to get some fresh air and I would tidy up the house. She didn’t argue, too tired from the nightmares she likely endured and called a good friend to go have coffee. 

I decided it was time that I learned what secrets my wife might be hiding and went to the attic. 

When we got married, Beth had told me that she left many of her husband's things up here. She has said it was wrong for her to sell them, but now as I understood the reality of the abuse she endured it made me wonder why attach herself to any memory at all?

I had never gone up here before this, and that made me feel guilty and foolish. Had I also been accepting things that were told to me rather than checking the facts? 

What if, like Katie, I was being led astray into a dark pit? 

When I got to the top rung of the ladder, I used my smartphone to peer into the gloomy attic. At first I did not see anything remarkable. Boxes of clothes, fishing gear. Nothing that made me think she was harboring a dark secret. 

But I got a little further, and I saw what looked like dried food. And wet towels that were soaked with urine. 

There was something up there that had been dead for quite a while, only brittle decay remained and it occurred to me that it was likely the corpse of her first husband.  A few clues told me I was right. He was handcuffed to a large chest and had wounds all over his body that looked like they were gunshots. 

She had intended for him to starve to death at first, I realized from the food. But something changed her mind and she ended it sooner. 

Why, I wondered, had she never bothered to clean up any of this? The police would likely arrest her on the spot if this was found. 

It also shocked me to realize that this meant none of her husband's family had even been bothered to worry about him. which I found strange. How had she kept this secret for so long? 

Behind me I heard a strange noise and I turned and saw the ladder had folded up, closing me in the damp attic. 

But I could feel that I wasn’t alone. I kept my wits about me and held the light firm as I saw the figure emerge from the dust. 

“Katie,” I said. My step daughter looked about the same as when she had given her life to the devil, and she gave me a soft smile before saying. 

“I was hoping you would find your way up here.” 

“Katie… I know that you think what your mom did was wrong… but I’m not sure you have the complete story,” I told her. 

“About him being a monster? I remember everything,” she said bitterly. 

I looked at her bloody hands. 

“Then why are you tormenting her? You know that he deserved to die.” 

“Yes. He does deserve to die. But he’s not dead yet. Not as long as you’re alive,” she said. 

The air felt sickly and thick as she gestured toward the mirror and I saw a reflection overlapping my own. 

“His spirit is attached to you, *dad*,” Katie told me. 

I wasn’t even sure how to respond. I was disgusted by the revelation and horrified. 

“So what happens now?” I asked. 

Behind her I saw the shadowy demon make an appearance. 

“Now it’s time for payback,” it whispered.

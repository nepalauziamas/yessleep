I am a college kid, you leave your home that you’ve been there for all your life. Now your all alone.

Responsibility is gone!!!! I’ve never had so much freedom. The ladies man, wow. 

But until recently my sock has started to stink like death. Not my foot, my actual sock. 

It started about a few days ago when I went to a friends party. There was a few of us and I got completely hammered. That night was strange though. When you walked into the house, the smell of onions and garlic was awful, just awful. They said it was because someone opened the fridge but it never went away.

I decided to just ignore it and took some shots. I looked over and everyone was just sitting there in silence. Not a single person had a expression on their face. It honestly scared me so I walked up and asked what’s wrong. No response. That’s when I genuinely got scared.

I grabbed my friends shoulder and it was like someone pressed play, they all started talking normal conversation. I told my friend, salm, “dude wth was that?” He was confused and called me a freak. Maybe it was just a glitch in the matrix I thought jokingly. After some small talk I asked them to take shots with me and the host, Amanda, agreed. Their liqueur cabinet only had a few bottles. There was malaybu, rume, and this dark red weenie. She said I should try the weenie so I did. 

The taste was awful. It was the exact smell from when I walked in, but as a drink. I didn’t want to be shamed so I forced a smile and swallowed. I look over and everyone was watching me with no facial expressions. In a hurry, I said I needed to use the restroom.

Going into the hallway, it was almost pitch black. There was a dim candle lit and some dead flowers hanging. “They must be goth” I thought. I find the bathroom and it’s painted in all black with no mirrors, no shower or sink, just a toilet. I mean we’re college kids right? Gotta live cheap I guess. 

I took a piss and that’s when the weenie started to hit really bad. I could barely stand. This really confused me because I only had two shots and not even a full glass of wine. I tried to compose myself and walked out into the hallway. That’s when shit got weird as hell.

I look down the hallway and Amanda is just standing there facing me with a candle. I asked her what she was doing and she just stared. I pushed past her and looked for my friend and the others. However, when I went to go look, they were in the basement with a sock on each hand in a circle. 

“Um what’s going on?” I said to salm, all he did was look up and laugh. Then they all started laughing. The door behind me flew shut and standing there was Amanda. I’ve never had a gut feeling so strong before that I needed to run out of a place until now. She locked the door and started laughing with a dark red sock in her right hand. In a second she was bolting down the basement stairs towards me. Before I could react I had her dark red sock over my head. I could barely breathe. 

At this point I’m fighting for my life. salm and his friends grab me and pin me onto a table. They start slapping me with socks from all around. There was no way that only four people were in the room with us. In one swift motion, I heard Amanda yell “WHO HE WHO SHALL BE” and hit me with a sock on my head.

Everything went dark. 

I wake up to being in my bed, like if nothing happened. I texted salm asking wtf happened last night and he has blocked me on everything. Same with Amanda. 

I went on about my daily life until, my sock is started to smell like garlic and onion. 

I have washed it twenty times and still it recks of garlic, onion, and death. 

I’ve noticed that someone is stalking me from afar. 

Why did that happen to me and why is my sock starting to smell?

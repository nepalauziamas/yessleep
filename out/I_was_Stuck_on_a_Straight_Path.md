So yeah I was stuck on what is realistically a Straight line path. 

There has been multiple stories where people are walking what should be a 5 minute path only to be on said path for hours. That's exactly what happened to me.

I wasn't in the middle of nowhere, I wasn't even in an unfamiliar place and It wasn't away from civilisation as you could literally see the houses through the trees but for whatever reason this damn path wouldn't end.

I've walked this path my entire life, it takes you to the rear entrance of what was my primary school so I thought nothing of walking it at night. There are lamps the entire way down and you can literally see the other end on a sunny day. There was fog however so the end was completely out of view, it's literally a 3 minute walk at best so I wasn't remotely scared or worried.

Until I started walking.

I was on that path for an hour which makes literally no sense. I walked passed lamp after lamp and the scenery just didn't change it was almost as if I'd make it to a certain area and be thrown back to 4 lamps prior.

I kept checking the time and every minute I was still on that path made me more and more confused. I was starting to actually get scared. Scared of a path I'd taken a million times because it just wouldn't fucking end. 

Then for whatever reason at the 1 hour mark I made it to the end. I just stood absolutely dumbfounded because once again this is a 3 minute path. 

Any ideas what caused this??

Update:
It happened again. I wasn't alone on the path this time so I know for a fact I'm not having a mental breakdown. My friend came to visit, she use to live in the village when we were kids so this path isn't unfamiliar to her either. Without fail we reach the 3rd lamppost and it feels as though we've been sent back. At the 2 hour mark we reach the end. The time seems to be getting longer. Now we had walked this path earlier in the day and it lasted the normal 3 minutes so Im at a loss for what's happening.

Update 2:
A kid went missing today. Like I said this path runs right behind my old primary school so it was just a matter of time before one of them got caught there. It's been a few weeks since I've been along the path so it's more than likely that the time stretch has gotten longer. We'll just have to wait and see how long it takes them to reappear.

Update 3:
Kid was gone for 2 days reappeared still in school uniform covered in dirt. What's strange is that people had still been walking that path during those 2 days so where the fuck was he?
I don't know what's going on with that path but the length of disappearances keeps getting longer.

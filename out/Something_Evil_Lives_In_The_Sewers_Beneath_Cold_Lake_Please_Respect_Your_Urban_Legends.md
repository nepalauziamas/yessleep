"Gross, it smells like shit in here, man," Calvin spoke. 

His voice carried down the seemingly unending tunnel, echoing far past the point our cell phone lights faded. 

"That's cause there's probably shit in here," Terrance started with a mischievous grin, nudging Cal with his shoulder. 

"Old sewage and rancid drugged-out bum shit." 

Cal dry-heaved. 

"Gross man," I interjected, "Please stop before he pukes." 

Terrance chuckled, slapping Calvin on the back and stepping away, taking a few steps down the opposite end of the tunnel. 

Calvin shuddered, glancing about the surroundings uneasily. 

Cal screwed his face in what seemed like a near-permanent look of disgust, eyes darting about and frowning as though he wanted to crawl out of his very skin from discomfort. 

It was always funny, Calvin being the tallest of us, how quick to fright he always was. Cal was a massive kid, just under 6'2, and hefty, with a build for football though he'd always lacked the interest. He was something of a frightful giant. 

I couldn't blame him at this instant. However, we'd certainly hung out in more congenial settings than the current - one of many tunnels in a maze of interconnected defunct sewer drains running under the Old Town section of our community. 

The idea had been Terrance's, born during one of our smoke sessions in the tree house in Calvin's backyard. Our conversation had moved from school to girls before somehow landing on the topic of some of our small town's local legends.

Eventually, the conversation turned to in particular. The story we'd all grown up with since middle school, and every kid who'd grown up in our town knew some variation of by heart. 

The tale of the Cold Lake 3.

It was one of those local legends but of more recent years, the sort of intoxicating blend of verifiable events and supernatural conjecture sure to leave a footprint on the culture of any quiet town. 

The story has different versions and endings depending on who told it to you, but the basic details were always about the same. 

Nine years ago, three older kids disappeared. This part was probably genuine; they were Katie Waller, Ben Wilkins, and Theodore Foster, or the Cold Lake 3, as local news dubbed them - students from the very high school I now attended.

I was in elementary school when it happened, and for that year, it was practically all anyone could talk about.

It had been the most significant thing to happen to Cold Lake and the surrounding county in some time. I recall even in elementary having assemblies about the tragedy and calling for vigilance until the police knew more. 

As time passed, theories developed, ranging from the idea that the three were friends and had plotted to leave town altogether to whispers of a murderer in Cold Lake.

As far as anyone knew, nothing ever came of the case, and when a year had passed without so much as a body, it seemed most media interests waned.

It was around this point that the stories began. I'd first heard it at my first middle school party, Dave Christie's birthday party gathered around a bonfire, Terrance along with me. 

We’d all gathered around the fire pit in Dave’s backyard, party hats strapped tight, and the high of sugar coursing through our veins beginning to fade, when his older brother, Brent, gathered us all together with the promise of a story, regarding the one topic everyone in town knew, claiming to know a side of it he insisted the “grown-ups” wouldn’t tell us. 

"First," he began, peering around the gathering of middle schoolers. 

"Who here knows about the CL3?" 

Hands shot up, and sounds of recognition spread through the group. 

Even at our young age, we’d all heard of the 3’s disappearance. Curfews and allowances for going outside to play became much more restrictive during that time. Our parents often wielded the threat of “ending up like the 3” as a cudgel to dissuade disobedience, wandering too far, staying out too late, the like. 

What few of us knew, however, the veil of childhood naivety and adult secrecy keeping it from our ears - were the stories.

These were the tales from some of those tasked with searching for the 3 and the whisperings that would trickle out from Old Town following the events. 

Brent smiled, eyes gleaming with a mischievous look. 

"Well then, which of you little dorks have heard about the tunnels?" 

None of us raised our hands at that question, unsure glances passing between my peers and me. 

He snorted, a forced sort of sound, scoffing at us. 

"Then you don't know the shit…you parents probably don't want you guys getting scared, and the police don't wanna admit they're clueless, but when you get older, you hear things."

He smirked. 

"You guys wanna know the truth?" the fire crackled as if on cue, making a few of us jump.

A few kids stood and left, reaching their limit on scary for the night. 

After the initial surprise, the rest of us nodded. 

"Those kids didn't run away, Theo, Ben, and Katie. People at school knew them, and yeah, they were weirdos, but not like that." 

My eyes widened as I began to process what he was saying. 

"You went to school with the Cold Lake 3?" I gasped. 

He nodded. 

"Duh. I'm only a sophomore; it was last year." 

The event had seemed so massive I had almost forgotten it was that recent and so close to home. I almost certainly knew people who'd known the 3.

"They were loners, except with each other. I think Katie and Ben were dating, and Theo was Ben's best and only other friend, so they were almost always together."

"My dad said Theo Foster killed Ben and Katie cause he was jealous!" a heavy-set boy a few spots away from me chimed in. 

"Your dad's a moron. Theo passed out in biology at the idea of dissecting a frog. No, they didn't kill each other or run away…" he sighed, eyes narrowing as if recalling something that bothered him. 

"Then what happened?" Dave asked. 

"The tunnels," he said, voice low and ominous over the hiss of a crackling fire. 

"They…they started hanging out in these tunnels under the old part of town.  There's an old sewer system under Old Town. They never finished it; no one knows why , but they sealed it off and decided to build the current system we have now instead."

I couldn't see where the story was going but felt riveted. It felt as though Brent was letting us in on a secret. The true depths of which I doubt even he knew and which I wouldn't find out until my nightmare beneath the city. 

"Well, Ben and Theo got bored one afternoon, wandering Old Town and smoking as they always did, and I guess they found one of the maintenance hatches and broke in."

As he spoke, recognition bloomed. I had heard of the old sewer line, years before from my grandfather. He'd been well past his best days, dementia wreaking it's havoc on his mind - but he always seemed to recall one warning.

"Stay away from the manholes in the Old Town, Darnell," he'd say, always using my father's name instead. 

"Ain't nothing good in this town, and even less beneath our feet."

As a child, his warnings seemed merely the ramblings of a fading mind, but sitting in that backyard, I felt a twinge of excitement as I began to connect the two. 

Brent continued. 

"They found a whole shit-ton of tunnels down there, some massive. There's never shit to do in this town, and before long it became their own personal hang-out." 

He took a sip from the beer he'd stolen out of his dad's fridge, a knowing look appearing on his face as he seemed to dwell on some uneasy thought. 

"It was weird, but they were kinda weird loner kids so the fact that they took to loitering in sewers made sense. Nobody thought anything of it until they started telling these…stories."

"It was Theo first. He swore that something was living down there, that upon wandering the sewers, he'd found a passageway into a part of the underground that was…different."

Another swig, and that troubled look deepend. 

"Different how?" I hardly realized I was speaking until I asked the question. 

He frowned a bit. 

"It was much too big," he started. "And too old. I don't know he he knows but, be said the tunnels he found were much too old to be built anytime recently. I guess he started getting curious," he said, "Heading in alone. And one night, he found something or - it found him."

A log popped in the fire, making my heart lurch with a sudden fear. 

"Something chased him out, he swore. He never saw it in the darkness of that old sewer, but he heard it. Something big, and fast, and *hungry*. Told everyone who would listen."

He shrugged. 

"No clue why he went back, why any of them did, maybe he wanted to prove a point - but the next time any of us saw the three of them, was on that day after school, heading for Old Town."

"S - so what happened?" Another kid asked.

"What do you think?" Brent snorted in response. 

"I know what the adults are *saying*, I also know that ever since the 3,they've tried to keep the old sewer entrances locked up tight, police have chased off a few kids trying to explore down there, for all the good it's doing. Why would they do that, if they thought those kids just ran away?" 

None of us had an answer, and I suspect, all felt much too frightened in the ominous dark of the night to say anything. 

"It's cause there's something going on down there in that old sewer. Something the people in charge know about, and are fucking terrified of, and are trying their best to keep hidden." 

He paused, peering around the fire at us with a devilish grin as if to let the fear settle in. 

"There are monsters beneath this town, kiddos. Try not to get caught." 

That was our first introduction to the idea of the sewers, and it wouldn't be the last. As insane as it might sound given what we were told, and the story most kids believed, the disappearance became a sort of urban legend.

With that status, the sewers became a spot for local teenage daredevils or fans of the supernatural to test their mettle. 

It was a badge of honor to return with your own creepy story of odd sounds chasing you from the darkness or sightings of the impossible that only the bravest of us received.

While most of these stories were surely exaggerated or faked altogether by attention-seeking kids,  some stood out in their consistency. 

With youth comes a strange sense of invincibility and a curious need to peer into the darkness. And so, years after that night, I now found myself and my two best friends roaming those very same tunnels in search of our own story. 

We would get *so much more* than we bargained for. 

It had been Terrance's idea, as these things so often were, a suggestion made over a joint following a horror movie marathon. 

The anniversary of the disappearance of the Cold Lake 3 had recently passed, and as usual, with it came a resurgence in stories and rumors about what had happened to them, the most popular of which amongst our age range involving the theory that there was something more to the tunnels beneath the city. 

It had led to a spate of self-styled daredevils and thrillseekers amongst our high school, making it a point to venture into the sewers in search of something. 

Though most returned with little more than tales of vague creepy sounds, there were the few who claimed to have seen them.

Kyle Bruck swore he saw something racing towards him in the water one week when he'd been spray painting the walls of the mainline, and Shelley Anders refused to ever return to the sewers after insisting she'd seen a face in some of the gray water. 

Terrance, however, was only encouraged by these tales. Always one to push the envelope and with more than a passing interest in stories of spooks and ghouls, the recent resurgence of the myth was a source of much excitement for him. Before long he'd convinced the two of us to venture into the sewers with him in search of local legends. 

It hadn't taken much convincing on my part. I'd been to a few raves in the sewers before, even hung out in the mainlines before, and while they were pretty gross, I had never found them quite so frightening - granted, I was never alone - and I would be lying if I claimed the myths didn't intrigue me as well. 

The idea that we might be our town’s excuse for frontiersmen, the first of our class, and maybe ever, in ages, to venture into some long-forgotten part of the little world constructed underground was exciting.

Calvin was a different story, ever the cautious one, and a bit of a germaphobe at that, he had little interest in hanging out in a supposedly haunted sewer system. 

Unfortunately for him, we're kind of each other's only friends, and anyone who remembers what those days were like knows the only thing worse than being scared at that age is having your friends leave you behind while they go off to do anything without you. 

So, he was right alongside us, face a permanent mask of disgust and unease, as we moved through the tunnel. 

"Look, can we just go back to my house or something, " Calvin groaned. 

I rolled my eyes a bit, though I couldn't begrudge his unease. The atmosphere down there was…strange. 

The air was thick with a dank, wet smell that reminded me of the year my basement had flooded, along with the faint but putrid scent of lingering waste. 

The tunnel’s construction was such that it swallowed anything more than a yard ahead  in the murky darkness, from which the distant sounds of running water and the grating *drip* of condensation on the damp pavement echoed.

I could almost see how it was enough to make the overactive imagination conjure images of figures stalking through the darkness ahead.

I shuddered despite myself. 

"It stinks down here, and I don't even care about these stupid myths, especially not enough to wanna hang out in these *creepy-ass* old sewers." 

Terrance faked a cough. 

"Pussy." he muttered in between, prompting Calvin to slug him on the arm. 

"C'mon, guys," I scoffed, "Argue when we get to a point that we can stand up straight."  

We had entered the tunnels through a massive opening on the outskirts of town in a ditch beside the now dry bed of a stream. I was unfamiliar with the entrance, as most people usually just entered through one of the maintenance entrances, but Terrance had other ideas.

Having heard about the entrance from a friend who claimed it led to an unexplored portion of the sewers, Terrance decided then and there that it would be our mission to be the first to venture the length of the new entrance 

The opening was a concrete pipe, jutting from the side of a ditch, where a stream had once run, an space no less than 5 feet wide on all sides, in which one could only see so far into the inky blackness. 

We'd been walking for a little over five minutes; heads crouched low to avoid brushing up against the ceiling, which bore a permanent flaky layer of brown that we all chose to accept as rust. On the way, we’d passed a diverging path in the tunnels, disappearing off somewhere to the right, and debated using it, but decided to remain on the straight path forward. 

We moved  in search of an opening into one of the main lines, which was where people usually chose to dwell down here for their size and adequate standing room. 

The main lines were the largest of the tunnels, massive, cavernous pathways of nearly 20 feet in diameter, with still rivers of murky, gray water five feet across separating the walkways on either side. 

"Guys, do we even know how long this tunnel is? How long are we gonna walk? What if we don't find it?" 

The steady undertone of panic in Cal's voice grew less subtle as he spoke, his questions echoing up and down the tunnel. 

We kept moving forward, though we had slowed to match Cal's dwindling pace. 

"Cal, relax, man," Terrance spoke, his tone less teasing but still playful. 

"Bill Marsh told me about this path. It's like, a five-minute walk, then we should see another opening. Crawl through there, and I'd bet we're in never before seen parts of the main line."

*Bet*. I should have taken note of the lack of certainty in his statement, but my back was sore, and I was tired. Along with my growing discomfort, my head felt too muddled for me to notice. 

"Okay, and then what? We just walk around until what…? We hear something creepy and get to run back and tell everyone?"

He looked unconvinced. 

Terrance scoffed. 

"I mean, yeah? We're not here for a tour of sewage history." 

I chuckled, offering Cal an apologetic shrug as he shot me a look. 

"Listen, man, if you're too scared and are gonna complain the whole time, just head back. You know the way out; Kevin and I will meet you back at the house." 

He nodded off down the tunnel towards the entrance we'd used. 

"But we've heard these stories since we were kids; Kev and I are gonna go check it out."

Calvin considered the offer, looking between us to see if either would relent, then head back down the tunnel. 

God, how I now regret not stepping in and agreeing with him. 

"Hey," I chimed in, "We'll be in and out. If nothing happens, hell if something does happen, we'll dip." 

I could see his reluctance, or resistance rather, waning. 

"On Monday, we can tell everyone at lunch how we braved the spoooky sewers under Old Town. Michelle might be impressed." 

"Fuck you," he said with a tense laugh. 

"Let's go." 

Terrance whooped, clapping him on the shoulder. I shot him a smile, and we continued forward. 

As we moved deeper into the tunnel, it became obvious we were growing closer to some body of water, as almost half an inch of water had begun to pool at our feet. 

In the darkness ahead, the hiss of running water grew louder, echoing from all around us off of the dome-like walls. The space grew tighter the farther we moved until the three of us were moving in a line. 

"Should be pretty close," Terrance muttered, the exertion of crouching for so long present in his voice.

"Bill said it looked like a real tight squeeze close to the entrance. Keep your lights pointed forward; we should see it soon." 

“Said?” I asked, straining from exertion.

“He hasn’t used the tunnel before.”

Terrance sighed; I could make out a nod.

“No. He doesn’t come down here much anymore, and when he does, it’s to graffiti up one of the main entrances. He found this by accident, and that was as far as he wanted to go.”

I didn’t reply, letting the response sit for a moment, and Terrance quickly spoke as if to dismiss any concerns.

“It’ll be fine. The whole thing connects anyways, and the town wasn’t even a third of the way done when construction stopped, so it’s not *that* big of a place.”

I scoffed but grunted my affirmation, far too strained to argue verbally as the muscles in my back and thighs began to burn in protest of our continued crouching. 

The sound of running water grew to fill the tunnel, and before long, it had soaked through the soles of our shoes as we moved forward, Terrance taking point, with myself and Calvin in a tight row behind him. 

As we moved, the distinct sounds of us moving through the water became our sole background noise, a repeating rhythm created by our almost regimented push forward. 

*Slosh - slosh - slosh*

*Slosh - slosh - slosh*

Along with the distant rush, it was the only sound to be heard in the tightening cavern, and it became something of an absentminded game to time my steps with everyone else. 

After almost five and a half minutes of walking, my mind became hardly aware of the noise as anything other than ambiance anymore.

I think that's why, when it first began, I hardly noticed the change. It was the already anxious Calvin that realized it first, a significant detail that the two of us were somehow missing. 

Having spoken after the fact, the few times we've ever felt comfortable recounting the experience with one another, I know now that Cal had become aware long before he'd spoken. 

That, stuck at the rear with walls to either side of him, he realized that if he was hearing what he thought he was hearing, our best bet was to push forward. 

I felt a firm hand grip my shoulder and turned as best as I could in the tight space to find Calvin staring back at me, his face illuminated in the harsh light of his phone, eyes wide with a look of silent horror. 

He moved his mouth, though nothing came out, and for a moment, confusion washed through me before I realized what was going on. He was mouthing something, a word. 

*Listen*. 

My face screwed, but I piqued my ears, stepping with measured care to hear whatever he was referring to. 

*Slosh - slosh - slosh* 

All we could hear were the sounds of our own feet pushing through the inches of water beneath us, three distinct steps forward. 

*- slosh*

Our eyes were just as wide as a warm, static burst flash of shock rippled through my very molecules. I had heard it clear as day from somewhere behind Calvin. 

Something else was moving through the tunnel behind us. 

I swallowed, as for a moment, the two of us just looked between one another, asking the same silent question, our looks answer enough. 

*Did you hear that?* 

We knew both had. For the first time since we'd entered the sewers, I felt much like Calvin as my guts twisted into uneasy knots. 

I peered past Calvin, hoping to catch sight of some other teenager making their way down the same tunnel, but to my disappointment and growing unease, we'd turned several corners since entering, and little to no light reached the long stretch behind us. 

Still, the darkness that now seemed to mass behind us felt…*unnatural*, almost oppressive, and from within, it echoed still, the unmistakable sound of someone drawing closer as they splashed through the water.

It was clear that whoever was behind us cared little if we heard their approach. 

I considered saying something, alerting Terrance perhaps, and by the looks of it, Calvin was too. Still, I shook my head. 

The echo in the tunnel all but ensured whoever was behind us would hear, a thought that made my guts knot with a cold unease. 

Were it not for the rush of water somewhere close ahead, now so loud it began to overcome even the sound of our own footsteps, our guests' approach surely would have echoed throughout the entire tunnel. 

"Here it is," Terrance spoke.

I pointed my flashlight forward with his, revealing the small, round opening in the stone wall ahead. On the other side, water roared in the tunnel below, rails lining the path for walking visibly on the other side, but there was something strange about it….the light shone and faded as it stretched past the railing, and still, it found only darkness. 

The entrance into the main line was a tight squeeze, almost a concrete porthole to the other side.

"Welcome, boys, to the underground!" Terrance spoke, beaming back at us, the light of his phone stretching odd shadows across his face. 

"Yeah, amazing, just *go*."

The urgency in Calvin's voice was almost panicked; though unaware of the fourth person in the tunnel, Terrance smirked, dismissing it as more of Calvin's usual anxiety. 

He turned, climbing into the tight tunnel and shuffling out onto the other side, beckoning us to follow. I did next. 

The tube smelled of rust and stale water, and I felt my heart race with the anxiety of being in a space so tight, only to soar as Terrance pulled me to the other side. I caught my balance with my hand, lowering myself out of the tube and onto the concrete walking path on our side. 

As I rose to my feet, I got a better look at the chamber that served as home to what was practically a man-made river.  

I felt my mind waver, a rising sense of tingling unease swelling as I took in the sheer scope of the space in which I found myself. 

"Whoa," I breathed, the word seeming to travel down either end of the corridor. 

"Yup," Terrance responded, "Welcome to the Underworld, motherfucker. " 

The tunnel was *massive* in a way I could hardly fathom being possible just beneath our feet. Somehow the ceiling and walls extended out at all sides until I was certain a passenger plane could have fit through.

"Guys, I don't know if I wanna try this…it's gonna be a tight fit… ." Cal's pleading tone came through the tunnel. 

Terrance turned back with a groan. 

"You'll be fine, man; trust me, I'll pull you through."

Calvin sighed, muttering to himself.

As I shone my light around, trying to get a sense of the space I'd entered, I could make out graffiti covering the walls, in various stages of wear and tear, all reading eerily similar and ominous messages. 

'We Never Should Have Opened These Tunnels'

'God forgive us' 

'Abandon all hope' 

And for whatever reason, the one that stuck with me the most, scratched into the wall just above the tunnel we'd entered through. 

'If you're here, it's already too late."

I stifled a chill, but it did little to stop the rapidly growing since of wrongness the air seemed thick with. 

I pointed the light over the railing, aiming it into the murky gray waters beneath. 

I could make out nothing, not even depth in the stream of filth, and felt oddly an odd twist of panic in my gut as I stared into it, as though something might be lurking just beneath the surface. 

I peered around the tunnel some more, illuminating more graffiti and impromptu art before the light fell on something that made me stop. 

At the roof of the tunnel, on opposing sides, sat what appeared to be valves, closed with iron lids. 

Between them was a warning, left in large yellow letters and accompanied by an ominous illustration I can describe only as the outline of a man, with a facsimile of the Grim Reaper lurking over his shoulder.. 

What it read sent a chill down my spine. 

"*WARNING: HOSTILE NON-HUMAN ENTITY -* *UNAUTHORIZED PERSONAL LEAVE IMMEDIATELY OR RISK DEATH*!"

My heart beat picked up, and I tried to force a nervous chuckle though I failed. Surely it had to have been a prank of some sort, or some weird graffiti left behind by a prior visitor meant to freak us out. 

Yet…that didn't feel right. The warning looked real, and official despite as insane as it sounded. 

*Non-human entity?* I shuddered. I'd not really expected pur journey to turn up anything, and things where beginning to feel much too strange for me, my mind running with those vague stories of what happened to the Cold Lake 3.

"Cal? What're you doing, man? Let's go." Terrance's voice pierced my sinking train of thought. 

I turned to face him and the tunnel Calvin should already have climbed through, yet with Terrance’s  light shining on it, I could see it was empty. 

I stepped closer, that strange sinking feeling only growing worse. As I approached, I kneeled over and could see Calvin standing on the other side of the tunnel.

He was trying to stand stock still, his back towards us, but his body shook uncontrollably. 

"Cal?" I called. 

"*Guys*," he spoke the word like a plea. 

His voice was wavering with a sort of terror I'd never heard in real life before, palpable and infectious. 

"*There's something in here with me…*" 

My heart simultaneously plummeted and began to race painfully as I recalled the footsteps we'd heard in the tunnel behind us. 

Dread washed over me as I realized something else about what he had said. 

*Something*. Suddenly, the story of the Cold Lake 3 felt horrifyingly relevant. 

"What are you talking about?" Terrance called, sounding slightly irritated. 

"Dude, stop freaking out and come -" 

"Guys, guys, it's coming around the corner. It's -" his voice stopped for a moment. 

When he spoke next, it was a question, his words tinged with palpable dread. 

"Oh god - what IS *that*? 

The sound of movement was unmistakable now, loud and growing louder each second, as it echoed from amidst the darkness of the tunnel 

Calvin stood stock still, tension clear in his body under the harsh cellphone light. 

The noise that came next I still hear in my nightmares. It was a cross between a moan and a shriek, wet, piercing, and wholly unnatural. 

It was as though the floodgates had opened, and dread flooded through me, filling my body and making my skin run hot. 

Terrance jumped, backing away from the hole we'd climbed through, standing stiffly. 

"GUYS, HELP ME PLEASE! IT'S COMING!" Calvin's horrified shrieks pierced my very being, curdling my blood. 

I could hear commotion, and in moments, saw the top of his head as he tried to squirm through the pipe we'd used to enter. 

His eyes were wide and bulging with panic, his face pale and glistening with a sheen of sweat as he tried to scoot forward. 

On the other end of the pipe, somewhere behind him, that god-awful sound tote through the air again, pushing Calvin to move even more frantically until he wasn't moving forward at all. 

He grunted with exertion, one arm out, the other stuck at his side, as he tried to pull himself free and into the chamber we were in, to no avail. 

"Pull me out!" he screamed, "I'm fucking stuck; it's getting closer!"

Terrance and I both hurried to either side of the opening, with him grabbing the arm flailing for purchase and myself gripping him by the collar of his jacket. 

From just behind him, in the tunnel we'd just been, a noise like a cross between a choking gurgle and discordant laughter echoed from far too close. 

It was nearly on him. 

I tugged, heat blooming through my face and my muscles screaming with exertion, Terrance doing much the same, and still, Calvin seemed fixed in place despite his and our frantic struggle. 

"PLEEEEASE!" Calvin's voice was shrill and raw, to the extent I couldn't imagine his throat wasn't practically bleeding. 

Terrance pulled, wide-eyed and sweating as he did, Calvin's own panic having spread through the both of us en masse. I timed my effort with his heart, pounding in my chest as we pulled once…twice…three times to no avail until on the forth… 

Movement. Cal slid forward just a bit, and I felt my heart soar. 

It would plummet immediately after. 

Our moment of respite was crushed, and all progress erased as, without warning, Calvin *shot* back into the tunnel with impossible force. 

"Fuck!" Terrance cried, nearly hitting his head against the stone wall with force, while I, myself, had barely avoided being pulled into the tunnel. 

The sound that came out of that tunnel was like a symphony to a nightmare. That horrendous gurgling paired with a strange sort of yipping bark that sounded almost like laughter…and Calvin's screams…

No longer were they the shrieks of a man in a dire panic but a wounded and dying animal fighting for its life. 

I had to fight the urge not to vomit, my head spinning under the steady flow of dread as though I might fall at any moment. 

Terrance cried out in surprise, stumbling away as a stomach-churning, wet crunching echoed forth. With an unsteady hand, shaking like a leaf in a hurricane, I raised my phone, aiming the light down the tunnel. 

My heart plummeted into the cold waters of dread rising in the pit within my chest. My vision shook as though my eyes were rejecting the sight before me. 

I stared through the tunnel, peering into a scene from a nightmare. 

Calvin was on his knees, a set of impossibly large, swollen hands holding him by his shoulders. 

They were covered in dozens of fat, wriggling digits emerging from all over, running up the rolls of its arms, digging into his clothing and fleshing - kneading at him excitedly. 

The skin moved and wavered, and it looked as though smaller fingers were trying to press their way to the surface. 

The thing's face was still obscured, reaching to the ceiling of the small tunnel it almost filled entirely with its massive form, but it was clear that what I was looking at was *not* a human. 

Or at least, it was no longer. 

It filled the tunnel, nearly crushing Calvin into the wall with its mass, an immense being of bubbling flesh and grasping fingers.

Calvin's screams filled the air, at this point little more than background noise to the horror unfolding. Small, thin strips of flesh like tentacles gripped at him angrily as it raised him closer.

"*Puh - please…*" Calvin whimpered, voice wavering with unrestrained emotion. 

The thing gurgled, its face - practically part of its torso - broke into a toothy smile, its impossibly wide mouth spreading to reveal rows of massive teeth.

Two fish-like eyes, like twin pools of oil, peered back at us. 

Despite its features being something out of a nightmare, there were traces of something human within, most notably it's expression - a smile, that made my blood curdle, dripping with malintent. 

It’s mouth opened, spreading far wider than any jaw should. My heart fell into the pit of my stomach as I watched it raise my friend until it’s mouth encircled his head.

He stared at us as best he could, eyes wide but devoid of hope. 

“*Go.*”

Terrance muttered a curse, voice shaking. 

“Sorry man,” he muttered, the hurt in his words shared. 

We ran, and the sound the followed us as we fled into the darkness ahead is one I’ll never forget. A scream of impossible pain disappearing immediately into a shrill gurgle, and a wet crunch.

Warm tears stung my eye as we ran. I felt like a coward, yet any faint idea of returning was dashed by the sounds it made as it devoured him, horrific shrieks that echoed off of the walls as though it were all around us.

The tunnel seemed to stretch on forever as we ran, and as the sounds of our friend’s end began to fade, the imminent sense of doom gripped us again. We had no idea where we were going, or if we were any nearer to an exit.

From somewhere in the darkness behind us, far closer than it should have been, that *thing* roared. Somehow, I knew its feast was complete, and we were next.

Terrance began to cry audibly as we both picked up the pace, his legs surely burning as my own were, hearts thrumming to the point of overexertion.

Another roar, closer this time. 

“How fucking far does this thing go?” I called, my lungs on fire.

“I - I don’t know!” he called back.

“It killed Calvin, Calvin’s dead and we’re gonna fucking die!”

As if in confirmation, its roar rang off of the stone walls again, growing louder over the rush of water. Our lights danced along the walls and floor as we ran nearly blind until I caught sight of something that, for the first time, was an ember of hope in this waking nightmare.

“There’s a tunnel, Terrance, over here!” 

I’d nearly missed it, as my light just barely crossed it as we ran, but by some stroke of luck or the blessing of whatever god might exist, I cough a glimpse of it. 

We stopped, something that felt against my every natural instinct as the very ground shook beneath us under the steady approach of the thing from the sewers.

It was another tunnel, not unlike the one we’d made our way through before, just a bit wider, a realization that even in the horror of the moment struk my heart as I recalled Cal’s final moments.

“Fuck dude, what if it doesn’t lead outside?” Terrance said, his tone now awfully similar to our lost friend. 

I swallowed.

“We have no other choice, that thing is going to catch us. It’s this or…” I trailed off.

We both knew there was little time to decide. Before he could take a moment more to think, I was moving, crawling through the opening at a fevered pace, and I could hear Terrance behind me in an instant - that thing approaching not far behind either of us.  

There was no way to hold the phone and make our way forward at a fast pace, so we sacrificed sight for speed, and in doing so, moved forward in pitch black, potentially even deeper into the maze that apparently existed down here.

We’d been moving for what had to have been almost three minutes when, from the opening of the tunnel, there was a roar unlike any of those before. Raw with a strange, animal sort of rage. It had found us. A sound like the rush of a train began from somewhere in the darkness behind us.

“GO!” Terrance cried. 

I needed no encouragement. We scurried through the tunnel like human rats in a maze, the threat of violent death baring ever closer witht the sound of a freight train when -

“LIGHT!” 

I felt a surge of hope erupt forth in me, somehow pulling energy from reserves I didn’t know I had and pushing me forward. As the tunnel curved I could see the source - it was the exit. It was dimmder outside than before, I could tell the sun had set a bit, but even that little bit of remaining light was a world of difference and we moved knowing full well our life depended on it.

“It’s getting close! It keeps grabbing at my leg man, go!” 

As the light frew closer, so did the creature. I could feel its warmth where I was, and the smell of rot clung thick. It was surely no more than a few feet behind Terrance.

As I reached the mouth of the tunnel, I took no liberty with grace, throwing myself out with reckless abandon sending myself tumbling down a small decline into a ditch on the forest floor.

I took a second to gather myself, dazed, and with an odd pain in my right wrist, but it all faded as my mind returned to the moment. Terrance’s face emeged from the tunnel a mask of sheer terror, a sheen of sweat making his hair cling to his forehead as he tried to throw himself forward much as I did.

He careened through the air and -

Stopped halfway, before snapping back into the ground below. Terrance’s leg remained in the tunnel, gripped by one of the fleshy appendages, its skin-tentacles all wrapping themselves around him.

My vision seemed to shake, a familiar horror returning as images of Calvin raised into the beast's mouth returned to mind. 

No.

I ran forward, pulling myself up the small hill just as he began sliding back into the tunnel, and pulled with every bit of strength left in me. He moved forward, just enough that his legs were fully out of the tunnel, though it still held him, but only for a moment.

Like something out of a movie, the skin on its arm began to sizzle, smoke rising under the sunlight. The thing squealed like a stuck pig, pulling the appendage back into the tunnel.

Its body seemed to shake and quiver until I realized it was readjusting itself to face us. Somehow, those massive dark eyes seemed to burn with anger, the look of a predator deprived of its meal.

We stood there, in awe, horror, and exhaustion until it disappeared back into the darkness with a parting hiss.

After a few moments, the two of us broke down and darted home both in tears.

I don’t know what I expected when we told folks what happened. Of course, we’d have to tell them, Calvin was dead, but I hadn’t had enough time to really think of consequences as we struggled to survive.

But there were none, none that should follow the suspicious disappearance of a teenager, anyways. We got a stern talking to about avoiding places we “shouldn’t be”, and both of us were grounded after. I know my parents never fully trusted me. Calvin's parents never forgave us, and I couldn’t blame them. His name is whispered all over town. “Just like the 3.” they say.

It seemed like already everyone knew. And yet, no one had told us. 

I guess that’s why I’m writing this. To tell you, that bored kid growing up in the quiet town looking for adventure. Respect local legends, they exist for a reason.

Otherwise, you’re bound to become one.

I like to spend my weeknights unwinding on my phone, curled under the covers in my apartment. Say what you will about blue light and the perils of doomscrolling before bed, but I find it peaceful to check in with my friends and the world. It also gives me time to thaw out my ten icicles (read: poorly circulated toes) before taking off my socks.

Somehow I found my way to the Photos app. I recently reshuffled my homescreen and I guess that’s where Chrome used to be. I kept navigating away from it, but my fingers’ muscle memory kept pulling me back. I gave up and decided to take a look. It had been a while since I’d looked at Photos, maybe since the last OS update. I scrolled back through my camera roll, the reverse timeline of my memories, and I had forgotten how much life (and a couple of deaths, unfortunately) had happened so recently.

I must have been reminiscing for a couple of hours. I do this thing where I hold my phone above me in bed, and then as I drift away, I drop my phone onto my face. That’s exactly what happened. The phone bounced off my forehead and startled me awake, and as I picked up my phone from the pillow, I saw a section in the Photos app with faces in a grid labeled “People”. I opened it up and it looked like there was a feature where the app grouped photos based on faces. I saw myself, my girlfriend, my parents, and then I saw a face that wasn’t a face. 

The main photo of this “unnamed person” was a photo of a warm sunset, the kind you feel a duty to archive when it’s happening, but then finds its resting place in your photos next to countless others. I clicked on the icon to see the grouping of tagged photos, expecting to see many other sunsets. The Photos app thought I was a completely different person when I was wearing makeup as Beetlejuice for Halloween, so I thought maybe the app gave the sun a face like the Teletubby Sun Baby (by now a Sun Adult, my tired mind imagined, wrinkled by its own unavoidable rays).

What I saw instead were a wide variety of photos. Some had people, some didn’t, and they started a couple years ago with the sunset. One photo was of a Foo Fighters concert, and it briefly crossed my stupid brain that I might be haunted by the late rock legend Taylor Hawkins, which is impossible because 1) he was alive at the time of the photo, and 2) Taylor Hawkins knows more famous people to haunt. All of these nonsensical thoughts were my brain’s warning to put my phone down and get some sleep.

But before I did, I did something I regret. Laying there, exhausted in the dark, I thought it would be interesting to see how the photo would be tagged if I took a selfie. Holding the phone above me, I navigated to the camera app, opened it, and realized there was no light to illuminate me. Still, the camera superimposed a yellow outline focusing on an invisible face beside me. I screamed and dropped my phone, this time hitting me above my lip. The front wire of my retainer cut into my mouth and I tasted blood as I scrambled for my bedside lamp, knocking over my glass of water, and startling myself again. 

When I finally turned the light on, I didn’t see anyone in the room, but I looked down and saw the glass of water standing full on the floor.

I've been up for the past 40+ hours googling, hoping someone has experienced this bug too. I feel like I can’t be alone.

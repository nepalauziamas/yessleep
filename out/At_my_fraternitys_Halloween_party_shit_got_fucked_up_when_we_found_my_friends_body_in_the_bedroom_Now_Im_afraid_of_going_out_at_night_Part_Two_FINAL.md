After that, the conversation ended and I looked at the clock. It was only 10:30. I decided to spend the rest of the time looking into both any possible satanic cults that might've been well known in the area, as well as asking, for good enough measure, a few of the approved V.I.P.s for the party if maybe one of them knew the girls and/or might've decided to invite them against the rules. On that end, I got more or less the exact same answer that I gave to Ronnie; that they'd never seen or spoke to either of the girls before the party that night. 

I didn't want to admit it, not at all, given what happened, but it looked like the only explanation for how those girls even showed up to begin with was that Wydell had been the one to invite them. Of course, I could see where Ronnie was coming from, that he likely wasn't aware of who they really were or what they apparently had planned for him. I mean, aren't the best serial killers the ones you can't just automatically look at and say "Yeah... something's fucky with you, sir."? 

But even still, that begs the question of how he'd have even known them to begin with. Yeah, I keep harping on the fact that he'd always been the "runt of the 'Knuckle-biter' litter", but only because it was, for most cases, true. He was always the level-headed one that could counter-balance the insanity of the rest of us three, you know? Before that night, the kid couldn't even land a date with a girl or get a phone number at one of our regular parties. 

But there he was that night, at our *Halloween "Invite only"* party, with two bombshells all over him, ready to take him to pound-town. What happened in-between? I'd have believed in it being “a stroke of luck”or "Twist of fate" , if it hadn't ended with him being flayed alive on my friend's bed like that. 

Another thing that stuck me out of nowhere, something I hadn't even considered before. Now, of course, I'm no kind of expert on witchcraft or black magic rituals or any shit like that  -- I'm atheist -- but why didn't they finish him that night on the bed? I mean, sure, it wasn't exactly an isolated space, surrounded by other people, and it *was* considered a miracle he *was* supposedly alive when I went to the hospital that night, but I couldn't help but feel it wasn't really "luck" that pulled him through. 

Think about it for a second, there was at least a 15 minute gap between the time the girls led Wyell to the back bedroom and the time Ronnie found him. And during that time, no one saw or heard a damn thing. In other words, there was *far more* than enough time for them to off him and make out the window like they did with no one to do anything about it. Yet, he made it...

 I got just about the same results as far as trying to research any articles about satanic ritual murders in the area. Just as well, I guess -- like I said, they're obviously know how to do this shit *without* getting caught. Then I decided to look into Wiccan rituals in general. Specifically, ones that pertained to live sacrifices.

For the most part, there weren't many, at least not any with details that would've been connected to what happened with Wydell at the party. Then, however, I found something on a webpage detailing the practice of "Practical Lycanthropy". Skimming through the page, I was able to spot some of the pictures of pentagrams being tattooed into people's palms, sort of like a branding. Apparently, this was a community type of thing, too. People united under the belief of what they referred to as "Werewolf magic". 

Now, I bet I know what you're thinking when you hear that -- I get it, trust me, I was, too. However, no, this apparently *wasn't* the practice of people actually transforming under the full moon or anything like that. At least, not under normal circumstances with this practice. For the most part, the people that practiced this were more into spiritually based transformations, "Unleashing your inner wolf" as they frequently termed it. 

Like I said, it looked relatively harmless. Odd, sure, but nothing extreme like what happened. That was, until I read a bit more into a bit of the culture's history. Apparently, around the 60's and 70's, there was a massive growing panic about stuff like that, occult shit. Similar to the Salem witch hunts, apparently people carried a growing panic about werewolves. 

From what little bit I'd read, apparently one of these supposed "Werewolf cults", as the post referred to them as, was a cut above the rest in terms of putting their practices into motion. In other words, like what you're probably expecting here, this particular cult was less interested in "connections with nature" or "becoming one with their animal spirits", and more interested in populating the earth with werewolves. When I tried to look, though, the post didn't mention any of the cults or any members in specific by name. 

All that was there was a short blurb about their little "Master race" of werewolves plan, and how they apparently went underground almost entirely after supposedly causing such a panic, with thousands of people having been found mutilated almost beyond recognition. Though, their method of introducing others into the fold was just as interesting. I read that this cult apparently observed a specific ritual where they "Fully embrace their bestial nature, embracing their rage and unbridled savagery, and exact their brutality upon the new pledge until he or she is close to death, by which they will flee, leaving the pledge to embrace their own savage nature in order to not only save themselves, but also integrate into their pack."

I'll admit, I was lost, reading this. Keep in mind, the normal practice of "Practical Lycanthropy" was an oddity to me. Now, here I was, reading some shit you'd expect to see in a shitty 80's movie. Yet, how the hell was I supposed to deny it? As batshit as any of this sounded to me, I couldn't lie and say it *didn't* add up. 

Wheels started turning as a chill crawled up and down my back. It was all coming together. The Pentagrams, with the site listing the marks on the palms being a tell-tale sign of a werewolf practitioner. The fact that Wydell was still alive, despite major blood loss and the fact that the girls had ample time to finish him off. And most of all, the way he was apparently "Recovering so quickly"...

*What WAS that in the hospital?* 

By that time, it was time for me to head into class. As you could imagine, I couldn't pay attention to a damn thing the professor was saying (fortunately, I think it was only a review day anyway). Afterwards, I made a beeline for Ellis General hospital. It was around 3:30 when I got there and I walked to the desk and asked the receptionist to see Wydell. "Name?" she asked, disinterested.

"Greg."

"Last name, too, sir." I sighed. I didn't have time for this.

"Dyers. Gregory Dyers. Wydell Lawrence is my friend and I wanted to check in on him. So can you please take me to him?" She just gave me a blank look before rolling her eyes and typing on her keyboard. 

"Let's see... Wydell Lawrence, you said his name was?" I nodded. "Yeah, sorry sir, I'm afraid we don't have anyone admitted here with the name Wydell Lawrence." 

My eyes went wide. "What do you mean he isn't here?" I exclaimed. She just shrigged, still giving me that annoyed look. "Are you sure? You checked through *all* the patient's names?" She sighed and turned the computer monitor to face me. 

"Look here," she pointed to a search bar and typed in Wydell's name. Nothing. "If he was here, it would've shown up just now. Hate it for you, but your friend ain't here." I sighed exasperatedly.

What was I supposed to do? If he wasn't there, then where was he? I even made the mistake of asking if patients from St. Leonard's had *actually* been admitted there after relocation. This earned me an annoyed groan and an exasperated "Yes." I left after that. 

On the drive back to campus, I texted Ronnie, telling him Wydell wasn't at Ellis General. 

**-- "Seriously?"**

\-- "Yeah, and I don't know where else he'd be. You were right about that being where they moved the others from St. Leonard's. But not him."

**-- "Well, the news did mention a lot of them didn't make it... You don't think..."**

\-- "Actually, dude... I might have something even worse..."

**-- "What?"**

I sent him the link to the post on "Practical Lycanthropy" and told him to read the section on the werewolf cults. About ten to twenty minutes later, he texted back.

**-- "Dude, wtf? What is this shit? Fuckin' WEREWOLVES?"**

\-- "Yeah, I know, it's weird, but read the part of the underground one. The ones that apparently want to  get others to join."

**-- "Yeah, I saw that. Kinda sick, if you ask me."**

I rolled my eyes in annoyance. *Really, Ronnie, you make jokes NOW?!*

\-- "Dude, that's kinda fucked up, don't you think?"

**-- "Well yeah, I mean, it's messed up, but still..."**

\-- "Dude, I think that's what happened at the party last night. I think they performed this ritual on him and damn near killed him. Now he's missing and there's the incident at the hospital."

**-- "Greg, man, are you seriously trying to tell me you think Wydell's a werewolf?"**

\-- "No, I'm saying that our friend is now missing, those freaky chicks are still out there, and I don't know what's going on or where the hell to look for him."

**-- "Okay, calm down, man. Here, I'm gonna call the police and tell them he's missing and ask around campus if they've seen anything."**

\-- "Okay. I'm headed back to campus now."

After that, I continued down the highway until I spotted it out of the corner of my eye. It was two of the girls from the party. They were walking down the sidewalk, laughing about something. Because I was so caught up with them, I almost didn't catch the fact that several cars in front of me had all of a sudden stopped at the red light. I ended up slamming in the breaks, narrowly avoiding rear-ending them. 

After catching my breath, I watched the girls continue walking into the nearby grove that was just a few miles out from the college. A thought occurred to me then. That must be their little meeting place. That must've been where they ran off to that night after attacking Wydell. Then I wondered, What if they know where he was now? This in mind, I decided to pull off and follow after them. Their pace was admittedly faster than I would've expected, but that also meant it would be easier for me to tail them without being seen. 

I followed them across the bridge and into the grove. They kept a steady pace ahead of me. Just enough where I could still see them, but not enough for them to notice as long as they faced forward. They kept walking deeper and deeper. The further I went along, the more clustered I noticed the trees were, blocking off more and more of the light from bleeding into the grove.  It got harder and harder to see both the girls as well as the actual road ahead of me. 

While I still had decent enough lighting, I pulled out my phone and snapped a picture of the two girls and sent them to Ronnie, telling him I'd found them and that I believed that they were hiding somewhere in the grove. I was shaken up from my phone, however, when I thought I saw a large shadow zip across the trees at the right of me. It was fast, and at first, I thought it was simply a trick of the light or something. 

The girls were still directly ahead of me, slowly walking deeper and deeper until I could just *barely* even make out their outlines. looking at the clock, I saw in panic that it was already getting on 5:45. The sun would be going down soon and, with as dark as it was already, it was gonna be a pain in the ass to try and navigate without turning on my headlights, thus giving myself away to the witch girls ahead of me. I had decided, having already snapped a photo of them in the grove to show to the police, to turn around and head back the rest of the way to campus when, this time from the left, up in the treeline, I saw the large shadow figure again. I watched it bound from one tree to the next, beating down right at me with large, burning yellow eyes.

The thing wasn't just huge, either. It was *fast!* It was keeping up with the cars pace effortlessly. I mean, yeah, I was keeping it relatively slow to begin with so I could track the girls, but even still, this thing was easily keeping at least one tree head ahead of the car. For a while, I kept my focus fixed on it, continuing further into the grove. When I finally broke away, though, and looked forward again, the girls were gone! In the split-second this moment had to set in, the beast from the trees launched itself at the car, landing directly onto the hood and damn near flipping the car over. The whiplash caused me to end up bouncing my head off of both the driver's side window and the steering wheel. 

Immediately, my vision was reduced to clouds and stars as I watched the beast then step down off the hood of the car. I couldn't see a thing of its face or anything else outside of its yellowed eyes. I heard it roar out before sending both of its boulder-sized fists down to smash the hood of the car again. I was once again launched forward, once again slamming my face into the steering wheel. Dazed, I saw the blurred form of the beast then rear back before sending its gigantic fist through the windshield, grabbing me tightly by the throat, and hoisting me into the air. I could hear the thing snarling. 

It was only being held just inches away from its face that I vaguely made out the shape of its head to be that of a dog or a wolf. *Oh, jesus... It's one of them! It's a fucking werewolf!*

The beast then choke slammed me back down on the hood of my car, holding me there until my vision clouded over completely. I felt my flailing arms then begin to go limp. Soon, I was out like a light. The last thing I could remember thinking was *Please, God, Ronnie, tell me you've called the cops and showed them that picture...*

To my absolute shock and amazement, I actually woke up again. I was groggy and my head throbbed and pounded. By that time, the sun was gone. Night had completely taken over, making seeing anything around me almost impossible. I tried to get up to move, only to find my wrists and ankles had been tied down. *What in the he--*

"He's awake..." I heard a soft voice say, giggling. I looked over to see the leader of the three girls standing over to the right of me. The other two were standing at my feet. 

"Wha-what the hell?" I groaned, stirring. "What is this, what the fuck's going on?"

One of the other two then squealed and said, "I wanna do it!"

"Patience!" the main one chided. "This is his night, remember?" She looked behind the other toward the darkness of the rest of the grove. There, just barely silhouetted in the, albeit pitiful, rays of the moon, was the hulking behemoth that'd had me only a moment ago. It stepped forward. I could hear it's angered growling as it approached. Instantly, I set about trying to struggle against whatever it was I had been restrained to. It was no use, though. I could feel whatever it was around my wrists and ankles painfully digging into them. I figured they must've used piano wire or something to tie me down where they did.

"Hey, let me go! What are you doing? What do you want from me?" My mind and body both were locked in a frenzy. The main girl came closer to me, grinning deviously. 

"Aww... He's scared..." one of the other two squealed. The beast walked closer and closer. I could start to feel its hot, snarled breaths from about a foot away. 

"I don't think he'd make a good addition to the pack." the other of the two said condescendingly. 

"Enough!" main girl snapped, "He will make a fine addition. He just needs to embrace, that's all. Just like any of us." The other two nodded to her in agreement before looking back at me and grinning.

"E-Embrace?" I exclaimed. "W-Wait, what are you talking about? What are you doing with me?"

"The same as what we do for the world." Main girl said smoothly. 

"What?!" The beast was leering over me now. 

"We are setting the world free. Setting humanity free."

"Free from *what?!*"

"From itself. You live in fear and in weakness. We are going to set the world free from this by ridding the world of humanity, raising up a new generation of peoples much better, much more elevated beyond human beings." She slowly stepped away and the beast took another step towards me and began to reach down. I started to struggle again, trying to keep from being grabbed. 

"When you embrace the starving beast within you, you'll see, then. You'll see what will happen for you, like it did your friend, here." My eyes grew at this. *So... So it's true. It's ACTUALLY FUCKING REAL! WYDELL IS A FUCKING WEREWOLF!*

"H-Hey, what're you--" I let out a cry of pain, cutting me off, when one of the beasts' claws delivered a stinging slash across my cheek. It belt like I'd just taken a red hot fire poker across my face. Main girl chuckled. 

"Only through pain and endurance will you be able to embrace the beast inside you." Following this, the next minute and a half was spent in the most agonizing pain I could ever feel in my entire life, in the past or in the future. The beast, Wydell, began to mercilessly hack, bite, slash, and just mindlessly tear me open all across my body. My throat burned from how hard I was screaming. The only things I could hear over them, besides Wydell's growls, were the girls cackling.

At one point, I heard the main one say "Can you feel it? can you feel the beast awakening inside you?" Soon, I felt my arms and legs start to go completely numb. My vision blurred once again and soon, dark clouds formed across the outlines of my eyes. Wydell kept hacking and hacking away at me, ripping bigger and bigger gashes open all across my body. I was so weak by that point that I couldn't scream anymore, only let out a very weak groaning. Faintly, I watched as the girls then approached Wydell from behind and each drew a knife from their pockets. 

Main girl held up her hand to Wydell, stopping him mid-swipe. "Enough." she said, coming closer to me with her knife. She approached me from ahead while the other two gathered at either side of me. "He must be marked for the pack if he is to join us." Then I watched her and the other two look up at the night sky. The full moon shown down upon the five of us in the grove, managing somehow to bleed all the way through the trees.

 That's when I watched the three of them begin to transform. They groaned and cried out in pain and adrenaline as I saw their bodies break and reshape themselves until they, themselves, were giant wolves like Wydell was. Then, the four of them were all leering down at me with yellow eyes. In unison, the four of them raised up and howled at the moon. 

I was fading fast. I was already feeling myself slip in and out of consciousness. Then, with two of the she-wolves at my right and left, the main one in the center at my feet alongside Wydell, I watched them plunge their knives down into both my hands and my chest and begin dragging the blades into the pattern of the pentagram. Despite being weak, and my throat being shot all to hell from Wydell's assault, I couldn't hold back from letting out a shrill cry of pain as they slowly and agonizingly did this. 

When they finished, they once again rose up and howled at the moon. By that point; pain, blood loss, and just sheer exhaustion took effect over my body and I faded out completely. This time, I was *sure that* would be game over for me. Unfortunately, though, as I'd find out just a few hours later, it wasn't.

When I woke up, it was to bright fluorescent lights and the steady sound of an E.K.G. monitor beeping.  To my right was a tray of different surgical implements, some of them being caked in blood, indicating they'd been used while I was out. My head throbbed horribly and when I went to move, I found my wrists to be strapped to the bed. Before I could panic, wondering what the hell the deal was, the door to the room opened and a nurse walked in.

"Well look who's awake!" she said cheerfully, giving me an, admittedly cute little smile. "How're you feeling, hun?"

I groaned. "Like my head's in a frickin' blender." She giggled. I tried to raise up my wrists where she could see, asking "Hey, uh, what's the deal with this?"

Her smile fell slightly. "Well," she began, noticeably hesitant, "See, when we brought you in, you were... well... let's just say, you were *restless...*" She chuckled awkwardly as she said this.

"Restless?" I asked. She looked at me again, now noticeably a bit more anxious. "What're you talking about, restless how? Hell, how did I even get here?"

Her eyes were fixed wide on me. "You don't remember anything?" I closed my eyes. the last thing I could remember was the werewolves howling at the moon and carving the pentagrams into me. Of course, I couldn't exactly say *that* to her, could I? Instead, I told her that I just remembered going into the grove and blacking out after a big ass dog attacked me. A *huge* stretch of the truth, but at least a hell of a lot more believable, right?

"You don't remember anything after that?" she asked nervously. 

"No. I don't. What happened?" Before she could go any further, the door opened again and two police officers walked in. 

"Could we have a minute?" One of them, a tall and extremely stocky one asked. The nurse nodded and got up to leave. He then turned to me and said, "Gregory Dyers?" he asked. I nodded. "My name's Officer Cordell, and this is my partner, Officer Tanner." 

Officer Tanner nodded to me, looking concentrated. "Now, Greg," Officer Cordell went on, "I can see you've been through... quite a night." He whistled. "I take it whatever happened also probably screwed you head a bit loose as well, so I get you probably ain't gonna remember *too much*, so why don't you tell us what you *do* remember."

"I... I was following these girls into the grove..." I stopped, realizing how creepy that sounded. I looked at the officers. They seemed concentrated on my story. "They were at a party at my friend's house the other night and attacked my friend, Wydell Lawrence." The two exchanged a look between each other before looking back to me.

"Go on." Officer Cordell prompted. 

"I was following them into the woods when this giant animal, I think it was a giant dog or something, came out from the trees and attacked me."

"So the dog did this?" he pointed to the pentagrams.

"No, they did."

"The girls?" I nodded.

"Was this before or after the dog attack?" Officer Tanner asked.

"After. Look, the dog or wolf or whatever it was attacked me and when I woke up, the girls had me tied down and were performing some sort of human sacrifice ritual or something. I swear, that's all I remember. Look, I can prove it, look at my pho--"

Officer Cordell raised his hands, cutting me off, saying, "Whoa there, calm down. Your story's actually checked out so far." I raised my eyebrows. "One of your little pals called in an anonymous tip about these three girls you're talking about, saying they were responsible for what happened to the Lawrence boy, and that you'd tracked 'em into the grove. Nice one, by the way, but next time, maybe don't try to go it alone, eh?"

"Okay... but then why am I strapped to the bed?" He exchanged another glance to Officer Tanner, similar to the nervous glances the nurse had been giving me earlier. 

"Well, like I said, we took your friend's tip and tracked you into the grove. When we did, at first, you were out cold. I figured we were too late, as cut up as you were. Out of nowhere, though, when ambulance tried moving you, you just up and went berserk!"

My eyes widened. "Wh-What do you mean by "berserk?"

"I mean "berserk". You started growling, scratching, even bit a chunk out of two of the ambulances. Took me and two other officers just to hold you down long enough for one of 'em to hit you with some tranquilizer before they brought you here." My heart fell into my stomach. 

I looked at me palms again, seeing the pentagrams staring back up at me. 

***"...Exact their brutality upon the new pledge until he or she is close to death, by which they will flee, leaving the pledge to embrace their own savage nature in order to not only save themselves, but also integrate into their pack."***

*No... No, no, no, no, no... Oh God...*

"You okay there, son?" Officer Cordell asked. I didn't answer. I just kept staring at my palms in horror. The Officers then stood up and turned to leave. Officer Cordell placed a card on the table next to me. "Give us a call if there's anything else you--

"Wait," I blurted, "the girls, what happened with them? You guys caught 'em, right?" Officer Cordell's face and sigh of disappointment gave me my answer. They were still out there. He told me they were gonna continue scouring the grove looking for them, but that it wasn't entirely likely they'd find them there, knowing now the place would be under investigation. They left after that.

This was just yesterday. I've been here, laid up at Ellis General since then. I haven't heard anything from Ronnie or Zack. They still don't even know about Wydell. They still think he's still either missing, or was killed in the attack at St. Leonard's. I'm not sure I could tell them the truth about it, either. Like I said, I'm *no* kind of believer in "spiritual transformation" or whatever the hell it was called, but I know what I saw in the grove that night. 

What's worse, now I'm one of them. They've taken me in as one of them now just like they did with Wydell. I'm gonna be a goddamn werewolf for the rest of my life. 

One night, a fucking Halloween party... Now I'm afraid of the night... God... I don't want it to turn night again... 

I don't know what to do, other than, whenever they finally release me from the hospital, I'm just gonna get in my car, and I'm just gonna drive as far away as absolutely possible. I wanna be as far away as absolutely possible if I have to live this way. I'm just scared though that I won't make it that long. It'll be getting dark again soon and I think the moon might still be full tonight.

I hate to say it, but if that's the case, then I hope to *GOD* these straps are tight enough...

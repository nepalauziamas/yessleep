You know, when we moved to Hawthorne, I thought I’d get a fresh start, but I’ve somehow managed to screw that up due to my own stupidity after only three days here.

Or, at least I think I screwed everything up. I’m still trying to process what just happened.

So, yesterday I was in the backyard, setting up my basketball hoop, when I suddenly got the feeling that I was being watched, but I shrugged it off and tried to keep working.

But then someone grabbed my shoulder from behind, and I screamed so loudly I think the whole neighborhood heard me.

I turned around, and saw a girl with long black hair sticking her arm through a large gap in the fence.

"Gotcha!"

“Holy shit! You almost scared me to death! What are you doing here?”

The girl smiled.

“I saw the moving van in front of your house when I was on a walk. We rarely get newcomers in this town, so I was curious.”

She walked through the gap.

“The name’s Heather Kim.”

She shook my hand.

“Nice to meet you. I’m Virgil.”

Now that she wasn’t hidden by the fence, I could see that she looked like she was about my age. Maybe a little bit older, she was pretty tall, but I'm very short for my age, so it was kind of hard to tell.

“Do you have any siblings?”

“No.”

“Same. Are your parents home? They might wanna do something about the fence pretty soon, 'cause anyone can just walk through that gap.”

“They’re at work.”

“Oh. Well you should probably tell them about it.”

“I will.”

“Cool. I’m gonna go now. I need to look for something.”

She grinned mischievously.

“Unless, of course, you want to help me?”

“Sure.”

“Alright, follow me.”

“Where are we going?”

“Hinstone Forest.”

“What? Isn’t that area dangerous or something? My parents told me to avoid it because I'll get lost."

“The woods aren’t dangerous once you know them well. If ya want to back out, then go home now.”

“What did you lose in there?”

“I’ll tell you when we get there. Again, if you want to go home, go home. You’re not gonna be much help if you’re all scared.”

Heather was acting *really* shady. Turning back was probably the best option.

But I didn’t, because I was new in town, and didn’t want to gain a reputation as a coward. Plus, I has no friends here yet, and she was pretty, and seemed like she’d be fun to hang out with.

Is this a super dumb excuse for following a girl you barely know into the woods to find something for her that she doesn’t even want to tell you about? Yes.

But I’m a dumbass, so I ignored all those warnings and went with her.

When we got to the woods, I asked her what we were looking for.

“My cello case.”

“You lost your cello? Aren’t those things super big, how can you lose something like that?”

“I didn’t lose my *cello*, I lost the *case*.”

“But how-”

Heather interrupted me.

“Shush. Once we go in, stay by my side no matter what. Don’t lose sight of me, got it?”

“Got it.”

“Also, if you ever decide to go in here alone, you need to sing as soon as you enter. Don’t stop until you leave.”

“Why?”

“It prevents you from startling the foxes. They don’t mind a constant source of noise, but one sudden noise out of nowhere will startle 'em, and they could bite you and give you rabies, which is a horrible way to go.”

I had no clue if what she was saying was true or not. It didn’t sound true, but it wasn’t unbelievable, and she'd lived here longer than I had, meaning she probably knew what she was talking about.

“So do we have to sing?”

“No. Our talking will be enough to do the trick. Unless you don’t want to talk.”

“No, I want to talk. You, um…you go to Westlake, right?”

We started walking into the forest.

“Heh. It’s the only high school in town, what do you think?”

“What grade are you in?”

“I’m a senior. You?”

“I’m a sophomore.”

“How many grades did ya skip?”

“None?”

I was confused why she asked, until I realized it was probably because I'm 4'11, and most people think I'm way younger than I actually am.

“Really? Damn, you’re super short.”

Fucking great. Now she's going to tease me about it, and everyone else at school probably will too. I should've just lied and said I skipped a grade. Maybe that would make her think I was super smart or something.

“Hey! You don’t need to rub it in!”

“I don’t think I-”

All of a sudden, her demeanor changed.

"Look down. Now. Don't look up until I tell you to."

I was confused, but I did what she said.

"Why do we have to look down?"

"Some of the animals here don't like being looked in the eyes."

"What kind of animals are you talking about? Wolves? Are there wolves here? I'm pretty sure we shouldn't be turning our back on a wolf!"

"No. It's not a wolf. We can look up now. Let me know if you spot a trail of purple mushrooms, my cello case is near that area."

In hindsight, I probably should've questioned her more about what animal she was talking about, but I didn't. At least I questioned some of what was going on.

"Okay...are there any other things here that I should know about?"

"Most of them won't make sense to you 'cause you're new here."

"Can you drop the weird cryptic shit and just tell me what I should watch out for?"

"Don't sit on the chair or the couch, and don't set anything on the table."

"There's a couch in the middle of the woods?"

"It's infested with fire ants. You wouldn't believe how many people sit there without realizing. Also, don't sleep under the hanging tree. People say it gives you horrific nightmares."

"Hanging tree?"

"It's where they used to hang people back in the day.  It's considered a landmark here, 'cause it's like the only reason people would come here to visit. Back in middle school, Angie drew it for an art competition, and she won. She got a thousand dollars for it. The picture's displayed in the trophy case at the school if you want to see it."

"Why would you sleep under a tree called the "hanging tree" in the first place?"

"Because people say you shouldn't, and people like doing things they shouldn't do."

At the time, I said that was stupid, but I was following a girl I barely knew into woods that I knew nothing about, just because she was friendly and cute, so I'm not really one to talk.

"You think that's stupid? There's people that play a game called Mushroom roulette. Most of the mushrooms here are psychedelics, but a few are poisonous. They look nearly identical, so people just try them willy-nilly and hope for the best."

"Wow. Has anyone died?"

"Of course! I even knew a few of em!"

"I'm sorry."

"Don't be. I wasn't close with any of them. Becky says that she saw their ghosts at the spot they keeled over, but she's full of crap so don't listen to her. If you wanna see them, you have to go to the old paintball arena. They love it there."

"Ghosts aren't real."

"Yes they are! I've seen a whole bunch of them."

"Well, I'll believe in them if I ever see one."

"You probably have."

"I think I'd know if I saw a ghost."

"Really? Okay, since you're clearly the expert, tell me what you'd do in this situation. You're in Hinstone Forest, and you see a tree with a bunch of dolls tied to the trunk. What would you do?"

"Run away, that sounds creepy as hell."

"And that's why you'd end up dead. You have to untie them. Look."

She pointed to a tree that had rotting dolls all over the ground beside it. Some of them looked really old, but most of them were from brands I recognized, like Barbie, and Monster High. Lots of them had decayed to the point where I could see bugs crawling in and out of them. I screamed again. If there really were ghosts in Hinstone forest, they all definitely heard me.

"Calm down, ya pussy! They're not even on the tree anymore, so they're not dangerous."

"Yeah, but they look terrifying!"

"Someone's clearly been here before us. Bummer. Untying the dolls gives you good luck. Brandon won the lottery after he took the dolls off three of those trees in a row."

"Who puts the dolls there in the first place? And why do we have to untie them?"

"People say they'll kill you if ya don't."

"And you actually believe that?"

"Why risk it? And to answer your other question, nobody knows. Some people think it's a little girl's ghost that died here in like, pioneer times, some people think it's this crazy guy who lives in the next town over, and some people think the devil does it. Me? I think nobody's putting 'em up. I think it's one of those things that nature just does on its own, like platypuses. Nature's really fuckin' weird sometimes."

Nature can be really weird, but I don't think it can make dolls and tie them to trees. I almost told her what I thought, before I realized it would probably be pointless. Heather seemed like the type of person who believes what they want to believe, no matter how much you prove otherwise. She reminded me of my cousin Daniel, who insists that sunscreen is toxic, and the government is made up of lizard people, except the things she believed were a lot more harmless.

But unlike Daniel, she might actually be right.

"Hey, look! We found my cello case!"

The case was in a hole. A freshly dug hole, from the looks of it. I could see a shovel covered in dirt leaning against a nearby tree. It was super deep, if I fell in, I wasn't sure I would be able to climb back up. 

"How...did it get in there?"

"Who cares! We found it! C'mon, help me pull it up!"

"W-What if I fall in?"

"Then I'll pull ya back out, shorty! Don't worry! Here, I'll lift it up a little so you can grab this side. Be careful, it's heavy."

I hesitated for a second. Was this whole thing a sick prank? Was she going to shove me in that hole and leave me there? Heck, she could've been trying to kill me!

(I didn't think about that last bit until hours after I'd left the forest. If there's one thing I've learned from this, it's that I'm really easy to murder. And if there are any murderers reading this, I'm politely asking you not to kill me. My dog would be really sad if I died.)

But I grabbed the end of the cello case she told me to, and lifted it. It wasn't as heavy as I thought it would be, and I was easily able to pull out my end of the case.

"See, that wasn't so bad!"

She dusted the soil off the case, then put the strap on one shoulder and carried it on her back. The case was nearly as tall as she was, and I wondered how she could've possibly lost something that huge. 

"Let's head back. The sun's setting, and you don't wanna be here when it gets dark unless you know this place well."

We turned back.

"The crazies love to come here at night."

"Crazies?"

"Meth-heads, mostly, and those guys who think the zombie apocalypse is gonna come soon."

"Doomsday preppers?"

"Sorta. They're not trying to survive though. They want to be the zombies."

"Why?"

"I dunno. They're fuckin' bonkers. Speak of the devil, there's a group of them over there right now."

Three guys in tattered jeans and dirty shirts started walking towards us. Even though it was hot outside, they were all wearing long gloves and snow boots.

"Crap. They saw us. If they try to talk to us, just ignore them."

We picked up our pace, but they followed us.

"Hi there Heather. Who's your friend?"

"Fuck off, Randall."

"Hey, little dude. Do you want to live forever?"

"Uh...no, not really."

"You sure? Just take a bite of this, and you'll be given eternity."

He pulled off one of his gloves. His fingers had several chunks missing from it, and I think I saw a bone sticking of his ring finger. He pulled a large piece of his flesh off of his finger, and offered it to me.

"Think about it, kid. Life is short. You don't want to die, right? Just try it."

I was too scared to even scream. I just stood there like a deer in headlights until Heather grabbed my wrist and pulled me away.

"No. Get the fuck away from us, we don't want any of your bullshit."

"Wow. Someone's in a bad mood today."

"Just keep walking, Virgil."

She didn't let go of my wrist until we were out of the woods. I was absolutely terrified at that point, but I was also kind of happy that a girl actually held my hand for once, even if it was out of fear for our lives.

I know that sounds pathetic, and it is, but...

There is no but. It's just pathetic. God, I thought I would be less of a loser when I moved, but it looks like I'm going to gain the exact same reputation I had in Seattle.

"Okay. We're good. They won't follow us out of the forest. You can go back home, thank you for helping me. I owe ya one."

"Wait! Shouldn't we call the cops or something? Those guys need help."

"The cops already know, they just don't care. Honestly, they're just mild nuisances, so they're not too worried about 'em."

"I'm worried about them! They need to see a doctor, they're hurting themselves!"

"People have tried, but it doesn't help. The weird zombie cult shit keeps happening, but since they aren't hurting people outside their little group, most don't even bother. There's bigger things to worry about here."

"Like what?"

"Like...crap! I have to be home in twenty minutes, but I have to drop this off at Mia's house because I promised I'd let her borrow it! Can you drop this off at her house for me?  I'll make it up to you, I promise!"

"I'll do it. Which house is Mia's?"

"616 Maple Street. It's the blue one with all those tacky lawn flamingos in the front yard. Thank you so much!"

"No problem."

She handed me the case and hurried away. It was heavier without Heather lifting up the other side, but it wasn't too hard to lift. It probably would've been easier to put the strap on and carry it on my shoulder like she did, but I was worried it would drag on the ground if I did, and I didn't want to damage it.

The case had two padlocks on it, which seemed a bit excessive, but whatever. Cellos are expensive, she probably didn't want it to get stolen.

(I'd completely forgotten that she said the cello wasn't actually in the case. If I'd remembered, I probably would've questioned why her friend wanted to borrow an empty case.)

So I picked it up, and started heading over to the house Heather told me to go to. It was pretty close to mine, and I'd seen it before, so I figured it would be easy to deliver the case and get back home before my parents got back from work, because they'd ground me if they knew I ran off.

(I doubt my parents are actually going to find this, but if you're reading this, please don't be mad.)

As I walked, I could hear things moving around inside the case. The noise they made was really weird, it was like the case was filled with rocks and old fruits. Something hard was being smashed against something super soft and squelchy every time I moved.

I didn't know what was actually inside that case, but it was *definitely not* a cello. Was she delivering drugs or something? If she was, I don't know why she'd trust them with a complete stranger. Unless, of course, she was trying to frame me for it.

Shit. That was probably it. I thought about putting the case back in the forest, but I really didn't want to go back there all alone. So I kept going, planning to leave the case on the house's front porch and then book it back home. I thought that I wouldn't get caught if I didn't ring the doorbell. I didn't even think about the fact that the house might've had security cameras.

When I reached the house, I noticed something was slowly leaking out of the opening. It was black and gooey and looked like a mix between slime and pudding. The smell made me want to vomit.

I dropped the case on the porch, and ran home. I spent the rest of night reflecting on how much of a dumbass I was, and I promised myself that I'd avoid Heather from now on, because she was one hundred percent doing something illegal.

I broke that promise the very next day. The doorbell rang when I was making breakfast, and I answered it without looking through the peephole. Heather was standing on the porch, holding three hundred-dollar bills.

"Here ya go. I told you I owed you one, and I'm a woman of my word. I gave you a little extra for helping me deliver the case as well."

"What the hell was in that case?"

"Why are you so nosy?"

"Are you a drug dealer? Is that why you wanted me to deliver it?"

Heather laughed.

"Drugs? That's what you think it was?"

"Was it?!"

"No."

"Then what was in there?"

"Trust me, you don't wanna know. But you know what? You were way more helpful than the other people that did this before. So how about I make you a little deal? I'll give you two hundred dollars every time you go deliver the case for me. I'll leave it right outside Hinstone Forest. You don't need to go to in the woods all you have to do is take it to the house and don't ask questions."

"I-this has happened before? What? Where the fuck are you getting this money from? And how do I know you aren't a drug dealer? Because that's what this looks like!"

"Drug dealers don't give drugs to randos, shorty. This is just another...thing that the forest does. I'm just helping nature out a bit."

She handed me the money.

"If you don't want to do it, that's fine. I can manage. But at least consider the offer. I'll be back here tomorrow, and you can tell me if you want to or not."

"Seriously, what was in that case?"

She didn't say anything, she just gave me that same mischievous smile she gave me when she asked me to help her yesterday.

"Tell me what it was!"

"See ya later!"

She ran off before I could ask any more questions. 

So now I'm sitting in my room, wondering what the fuck was in that case, and why Heather paid me three hundred dollars to put it on someone's doorstep, and why the police here don't even care about the people in the woods who are eating their own hands. I've been staring at the money she gave me for half an hour.

Three hundred dollars is a lot of money, and my parents have been asking me to get a job ever since I turned sixteen...

I'm not *actually* thinking of accepting her offer, right? It's a terrible idea. I barely know her. She is almost definitely doing something illegal.

But if there's one thing you can take away from last night's events, it's that I'm *terrible* at making good decisions.

Because I just sent a text to my parents, telling them I got a new job.

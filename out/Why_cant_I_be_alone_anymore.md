A bit of backstory. I’m a 22 year old university dropout. I lost my parents when I was 6 years old, in an airplane accident, or so my grandparents told me. I was never good at making friends and I was bullied in school. As such I never had real friends. Everything changed when I started playing LOL back in 2014.
There I had many “friends” and they actually cared if I missed an opportunity to play with them. As time went on they began forgetting about the game and me and I was alone once again. 

That brings us to April 2020.

I decided to drop out of university when the pandemic struck. We all had to stay in, which I didn’t mind. I continued playing LOL. I thought that I was better staying inside. By November 2020 I had become severely depressed and alcoholic. All that loneliness had affected my mental health. 


This went on until May of 2022.

It was then that I found an article about spiritualism and its benefits. I soon became obsessed with the paranormal. Late one night I searched how I could communicate with the other side. And there it was. The ouija board ritual. I wanted to try it out. Since I had no money though I decided to go with the other method. I wrote all the letters on small pieces of paper as well as the words yes and no. But then… I got scared and left it. 
Some days later I was feeling depressed  and had nothing to lose. Also I could ask for happiness (or so I thought). I went to my setup and started the seance. 

Is there anyone with me. YES
Do they know me. YES
Do I know them. NO
What is their name. Jonathan
Could he make sure that I won’t be sad or depressed again…

He paused.

YES

And that’s where I decided to end it. I thanked Jonathan for being with me and went to sleep. 

For the next 3 weeks I could actually communicate with Jonathan using the homemade ouija board. I talked to him for most of my day and he actually made me feel much better. The almost 2 years of depression were gone since I could openly speak with someone who wouldn’t judge me and rather help me. 

As mid-June came by though, I started noticing some weird things happening in my house. Stuff was missing or was in another place from where I had left it. I didn’t notice at first because it was small thing. What got me creeped out was that the small paper from my homemade ouija board were on my desk spelling “NOT SAD”

I tried to communicate with Jonathan but he wouldn’t answer. Then I thought he had left and got up in a hurry to search for some information on what to do. Once I sat on my chair and turned on my pc, I felt a painful scratch on my back. I jumped from my seat trying to find who it was but I was alone once again.

From then on every time I was depressed or sad I feel a painful scratch on my back and a whisper is heard but it’s so low I can’t understand what it says. 

Recently my grandmother passed away and when my grandfather told me I wanted to cry so hard but I could not. When my happiness turned to sadness I started feeling 4 nails on my neck. I held my tears although I couldn’t. 

I can’t be sad anymore. He does everything so I’m not. But that means I’m in pain. When I’m feeling down I’m feeling pain. He does everything to make me happy. Maybe he thinks we’re friends?

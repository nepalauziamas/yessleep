&nbsp;

My inability to move only lasted a second. I ran down the stairs, stopping myself against the door, and twisting the handle. My ribs were still hurting from our tumble down the stairs.

"Jake, Jake!" I yelled, trying to make my fingers grip the knob. It was slippery since my hands were covered in that black grime from the upstairs. The knob wasn't budging. Not even a wiggle. It wasn't locked. It was being *held* shut.

I pounded on the door harshly with my fist, leaving black marks on the white wood. 

"Jake!" I screamed.

Suddenly, the handle twisted, and the door swung open with my full weight behind it. I managed to stop myself from going forward past the threshold as the door slammed against the wall with its full force. I felt my heartbeat in my ears as I stared into a blanket of darkness. I could see a few feet of carpet before it was absorbed into the black.

The flashlight, still on, could only penetrate so far. It was pointed at the wall to my right, and it's reflection did more to fight the dark than the faint light at the top of the stairs. I scooped up the light and pointed it into the basement. The amount of normalcy was... odd. The fireplace glass reflected a little light back at me. The couch and armchair cast soft shadows on the wall beyond. The floor was clean and untouched. No grime, no stacks of boxes, no sign of misuse or disuse. It looked just like the last time we'd left it.

"Jake," I whispered, moving the flashlight around the room. To the left of the fireplace and seating was what used to be the laundry room, and to the left of that was the bathroom. If I rounded the corner to my left and followed the short hallway back, it would lead to a large storage room.  To my right and around the corner was another short hallway with two more small, spare bedrooms. All the doors I could see were closed. 

Jake could be anywhere down here, behind any door. And whatever dragged him here could be hiding anywhere. There were two blind spots on either side of me that it could jump out of when I crossed the threshold.

I wanted to just give up. Sit down on the stairs, put my head in my hands, and just close my eyes. No reason to continue. No reason to subject myself to this horror. No reason to go and get anyone to help. It was over. I was done for.

A rustling behind me made me spin around. The journal slid forward a couple more inches, then dropped off the stair it was on. It bounced a few times before coming to rest three steps behind me. I glanced into the basement, then risked looking back to grab the journal. It had fallen open to a specific page. In large, capital letters, not cursive, but blocky, I read the words "DONT GIVE UP."  The ink was equally faded like the rest of the book. Grandpa's motivation.

"Okay," I breathed, holding my sore ribs with one arm. And before I could stop myself, I took several steps into the basement. With the flashlight, I whipped my eyes around the entire place. I was in the middle of the room with full view of both hallways and all doors.

No one was down here.

It wasn't entirely unexpected when the door to the basement slammed shut. I still jumped, but it wasn't as startling as it should be.

When the sound of the slamming door stopped echoing, there was silence again. I used the flashlight to look all over the room again, unwilling to walk from my central vantage point. The flashlight painted the room in a starchy white light. The directional light source didn't do much to illuminate the entire room.

I pulled out my phone, dragged down on the lockscreen, and activated my flashlight so I could have a second source. But the light barely did anything. The phone's light was so weak that it only reached my arm a few inches away before vanishing. What the hell?

My phone was utterly useless down here. Somehow. 

Instead of wasting the battery, I turned off my phone's light and put it back in my pocket. I pretended not to panic at the date and time. My phone claimed it was the 23rd. Almost four entire days had passed since I first entered Grandpa's house.

My hand swept the flashlight back over the door, and my stomach sank. The door looked... off. I angled my head, trying to figure out what was wrong. In a panic, I ran over to it and put my hands to the door. It was now perfectly smooth, where before it had four indented rectangles on it. My hands outlined the door, and my fingernails dug in to confirm what I was seeing. The door was no longer a door, but a wall painted to look like one. The handle was just a painted, silver circle. Totally flat. No cracks. Just a wall with paint on it.

I would have panicked if that feeling of helplessness hadn't returned, keeping my heart rate slow and my brain foggy. How was this possible? How was any of this possible? Was I dreaming? Was I drugged? Was the dark playing tricks on me, and I was actually feeling up a wall and there never was a door here?

I felt for the lightswitch that I knew was just around the corner from the door. Instead of a lightswitch, there was a hole in the wall. The unexpected texture made me jump. I peered around to verify. The light switch was indeed missing. It was completely torn out of the wall, probably by whatever was here.

I stepped back to think, and felt the carpet stick to my shoe. Pointing the flashlight, I inspected the carpet. The black grime from upstairs formed a line away from where the door had been and into the middle of the room. There, it stopped. I stared at the endpoint, just a few feet away.  Whatever had grabbed Jake had been invisible, so was he now invisible too? It didn't seem so far-fetched after everything that had happened so far.

Cautiously, I stepped on the spot where the trail ended. Nothing. I leaned in closer to get a better look, and noticed that the trail didn't really end there, it just changed. It went from a line, which was actually two staggered lines, to small splotches spaced along the carpet. I followed them closely as the led to the hall on my now left where the two spare bedrooms were. They came to a stop in front of the spare bedroom closest to the main room. The first spare room.

Once again, I swept my flashlight all around the room, expecting a trap. Expecting something to pop out and grab me now that I'd followed its breadcrumb trail. But nothing did. My hands were full, so I secured the journal under my arm that held the flashlight. The door handle twisted normally under my slimy hands, and I was able to pull it open a gap to peer inside, flashlight pointed.

Behind the door was supposed to be a sparse bedroom with a twin bed, a dresser, and a closet. That's what it was the last time I remembered it.

Instead, I found yet another staircase. Exactly the same as the one I'd just come down. Perfectly maintained carpet, white walls, white door, and a single light fixture. I tapped the switch on the wall, and the light turned on.  The light spilled up into the room I was in, adding to the glow of my flashlight. 

As far as I knew, most basements didn't have a second level. And, unless Grandpa had someone come and build a second set of stairs, this had absolutely been a spare bedroom before this.

Then again, the door back upstairs had disappeared. Nothing was making sense here.

The trail of slime stopped at the threshold. There was no grime on the stairs leading down. The door at the bottom was closed and untouched.

This didn't feel right, though. Things had been happening so quickly that I felt a need to take things more slowly. So, I sat at the top of the stairs, gave one more cautious look around the basement, and cracked open the journal.

I skimmed to where I thought the page with the drawn door was. I used it as a type of bookmark to go off of. I decided to work forwards through the book. The next page was the same cursive scribbles, all in neat lines and rows. Try as I might with every angle of the flashlight, I couldn't read the text. It was just too faded and the handwriting was too obscure. The next page was a quickly sketched shape. It took me a few minutes to realize that it was an outline. An outline of the basement. The fireplace, couch, bathroom, storage room, laundry room, and two bedrooms were labelled. Even the stairs were labelled, but they were called "Entrance". Each door labelled had a series of x's and o's next to it. I counted them, and it was well over twenty, and they were all the same amount. Every door had the same combined number of x's and o's. But why? And what did they mean?

I counted which door had the most o's. It was obvious to me that x's would be bad and o's would be good, but good and bad for what? The door that had the most o's was the one in front of me. The one the splotches of grease led to.

Curious, and trying to figure it out, I got up and went to the other spare bedroom. This one only had four o's. I set the journal on the floor, readied my flashlight, and opened the door. 

The opening lead to yet another staircase. The exact same one. I left the journal on the floor and sped to the laundry room door. Opened it to find another staircase. And another one for the bathroom. And another for the storage room. Five doors. All staircases. Identical. There were no marks to distinguish any of them. I ran the flashlight over the door frames, and no symbols appeared. I turned on all of their lights so I could illuminate the room better and think.

I brought the journal over to the middle of the room so I could see all the stairs. The light from all five staircases made the room have a yellowish glow, broken up by the harsh white of my flashlight.

The first spare bedroom had the most o's, the second spare bedroom had less, the bathroom and storage room were tied, and the laundry room was either above or below the second spare room.

I decided to stick with my count of the o's theory. That would mean I'd go down the first spare room. Nodding to myself, I picked up my two supplies and marched to the stairs. I hesitated at the top, doubting my decision, then plowed ahead, stomping down the steps. I doubted myself more and more as I descended until I got right to the door.

The handle was coated with black oil. This *had* to be it.

I threw open the door to be faced with yet another wall of complete darkness. This time, it wasn't as bad, because the light of the stairwell spilled into the room beyond. My eyes adjusted to the dark while I pointed the flashlight into the room.

It was yet another basement. An identical basement. Fireplace. Couch. Armchair. Closed doors. All the same. I'd gone from my grandparent's basement... to my grandparents basement.

What. The. Hell.

I lost all caution. I *ran* into the room, throwing the flashlight along all the walls to make sure no one was there. I threw open every door. They were all the same. Staircase. Staircase. Staircase. Staircase. Staircase.

Five identical stairs. When I had turned on all the lights and stopped to catch my breath, I noticed that the door I'd entered through had closed itself and sealed again. Just a painted door. And, to my dismay, there were no more grease stains. The room looked the same as it had in my childhood. No signs of which way Jake had been dragged.

Shit.

I opened the journal again for some kind of clue. The diagram remained the same. A series of x's and o's next to every door. I counted them again, wishing I had a pen of my own so I could write notes. About thirty total at each door. All the same number, still. As I stared at the page, I noticed that there were several signs of ripped paper at the spine. Multiple pages before this one had been ripped out. On closer inspection, the x's and o's were written in pencil, and had been erased and rewritten in different orders. The light of all the stairs made it easier to see the faint markings of erased pencil. 

This diagram had been worked on. Heavily. Adjusted. Tested. It was already clear that this was a maze of some kind. Somehow. 

I tried to ignore the supernatural aspect of it and focus on solving the problem.

Going back the way I came was not an option. The doors sealed themselves. Which meant I had *better* have made the correct choice this time, or I was screwed. It wasn't clear how Grandpa had made multiple attempts on the maze like the erased marks indicated, but he had battle tested this maze and mapped it.

And, crossing my fingers, this map was complete and not a work in progress. Or... I didn't want to think about the alternative. Focus on what I can control.

I tried turning a few pages into the book, looking for more clues about this maze. More faded handwriting, more diagrams that didn't look familiar. It looked like, even if I got to the end of this maze, there would be more. The hopelessness was crushing. I'd never felt more hopeless before. For a few minutes, I considered propping the couch up and letting it drop on my head to kill myself.

I don't know how long I stared at that chart, turning it around, trying to analyze the erased marks, before I finally had an epiphany. I was staring at the door I'd used the first time and analyzing that sequence of marks. It was the only door with an "o" next to it as the first mark. 

It wasn't the number of x's and o's. 

It was the order. 

All the doors had the same total number of marks. Thirty marks. Thirty stages. Thirty doors. Each stage had only one o, and that was next to a door. The markings were stages to take. And, thanks to the grease stains on the carpet, I had taken the correct first step.

I checked my work to be sure. Each stage had only one o, and that was next to a specified door. No stage lacked an "o" or had two of them.

Time to follow the map.

I looked for the second "o", and found it at the laundry room. I turned toward the open, doorway to my right and crossed the entrance. Down I went, looking for any more signs of oil stains. I found it on the door handle. That confirmed to me that I was going the right way.

With a bolster of strength weighed down by a renewed desire to sit down and give up, I turned the handle and thrust it open. Yet again, another black basement. The flashlight confirmed all the same features. Fireplace. Couch. Armchair. Closed doors. Yet another stage in the maze. 

I stepped into the room, the door slammed shut behind me and became a painted door. The dark returned, and I was left with nothing but my flashlight and journal for a guide.

Every door contained staircases. Once they were all opened, I consulted my map. Next would be the storage room.

Again and again, I descended. After the fourth room, the grease stopped appearing on the door handles. But finding the grease that many times in a row just confirmed my faith in the map. There was no going back, only forward. Every slammed door that melted out of existence sealed me further into my progress. This would either lead somewhere or trap me forever. Every time I went down a set of stairs, my despair would flare up again. What would happen when I got to the last stage, opened the door, and found another basement? I'd have no direction. No greasy handles leading me on. No idea where to go next.

The page that said "DONT GIVE UP" from Grandpa lent me a lot of comfort. If he could do it, so could I. The man who he used to be was guiding me. The one who pointed out errors in my stories, making them better with every review. The man who encouraged me at every turn when I had felt discouraged before. When I felt bad that something I showed him wasn't up to his standards, he boosted me up.  And now, every set of stairs I descended, I let his handwritten words boost me again.

&nbsp;

I was down to my last few stages when I remembered the light switch. I hadn't even looked for it after finding it ripped out of the wall. I'd simply opened every door, turned on every light in each stairway, and relied on that for light. Curious, I searched for the lightswitch in this stage. And it was there. Intact. Whatever had come down this way hadn't destroyed this one. I sighed in relief, happy to have more light on my journey. With one finger, I flipped the switch to the on position. The ceiling light above the couch didn't turn on. Instead, there was a deep rumbling that shook the room.

My finger was frozen on the switch. I realized that I may have just completely fucked myself. Everything had been going fine. Now I'd never get out of--

The light fixture exploded downward, forced down by pressure from above. The glass barely had time to shatter before it was pushed around by a flow of water. The stream forced itself down from the ceiling in a large column. The ceiling was starting to form cracks from the sheer force the water came down in. I flinched, startled, and watched with horror and curiosity as the water spread outward faster than a hole in a ship. The water lapped past my ankles and began to drain down the stairs of all five doors. By the time I got my wits together, the stairways had already collected several inches of water.  There was no sign of stopping.

It was no odder than the door completely vanishing behind me, but still it held me with curiosity. "How?" I thought.

I saw how quickly the stairwells were filling with water. Before long, the entire room would be flooded. I'd be *completely* trapped, and I doubted the water would stop until the entire basement was flooded.

My hands fumbled with the journal, shaking heavily. I almost dropped the already faded text into the water. That would have spelled disaster.

The next door was the laundry room again. The door closest to the waterfall, of course. The rapidly flowing water was disorienting as I waded through an ankle-deep stream to the laundry room. The carpet squashed under my shoes, not able to absorb enough of the water to make a difference. The water was cascading down the stairs in dizzying display. I placed my hands on each side of the wall to keep from slipping while I descended. The journal was kept high above the water's reach, along with the heavy flashlight. My arms became quickly sore, but I took my time. One misstep, and both me and my equipment would be underwater. 

The pool at the bottom of the stairs had risen to several feet already. If I didn't move fast enough, it would be above my head soon.

I finally touched the last step just as the water was up to my stomach. I traded hands so my equipment was all in one hand, then tried the handle with my free hand. It twisted easily, and before I knew it, the door was forced open by the weight of the water. I was thrust into the room with the force of a broken dam. I managed to toss the journal and flashlight toward the fireplace where they landed away from the reach of the rising tide. For now.

The water was still streaming into the room. And the door wasn't sealing itself. The waterfall down the stairs only seemed to increase. Every time the door started to close, the force of the water would push it back open. Apparently whatever force closed the doors was too weak to seal it this time.

Clothes soaked, hair dripping, I got to my feet. The room was dimmer than usual because the flashlight was partially obscured by the journal. Something about the overwhelming sound of several waterfalls and the near-dark opened a primal fear inside me. I began to panic. Running to the fireplace, I snatched my things before the water spread that far. A quick glance around the room with my flashlight told me I was still in danger. The water was already rising against the brick fireplace and probably accelerating. The waterfall down the stairs was relentless, turning from a cascading splash to a steady flow.

I wiped my wet hands on my soaked clothes to try and clear my dripping hands off before I opened the journal to find the next door. I had to be fast.

Next door was the storage room.

Holding the journal and flashlight high above my head, I splashed quickly to the storage room and threw open the door. Immediately, water began running down the stairs, starting out as a rivulet, but quickly growing. I bolted down the stairs, taking them cautiously but quickly. The water was only a couple inches high by the time I got to the bottom. The pool spread into the next basement immediately. The carpet began to soak up the water and squelched under each step.

I stepped back, waiting for the door to seal itself and stop more water from coming, but it didn't move. It stayed wide open, allowing the stairs to become yet another waterfall. There was nowhere else for the water to go except to follow me. There were no other staircases to fill in the room directly above since I hadn't opened their doors.

With the door in one hand, I pushed it closed against the flow of water. It struggled toward the end as the pressure built, but I managed to get the door to shut completely. I heaved a sigh of relief, but it was cut short when I realized the door was only closed, not sealed. The handle was still there. When I let go of the wood, the door suddenly whipped open again, hitting my shoulder and almost knocking me down. Gallons worth of water flooded into the room, forcing the door to stay open. The latch hadn't even caught on the door jam. On closer inspection, the door jam didn't have a hole for the latch to embed into. The door couldn't stay closed even if I managed to shut it again.

I was wasting time. I needed to get ahead of this water.

Going from door to door, I threw them all open and turned on the light. The flashlight illuminated the glare of wet carpet as I went. The threat glinted white light back at me as I rushed. Once all the doors were open, the water was at ankle height again. I was wasting time, but I hoped it would buy me some in the next few stages of the maze. 

As I made my way to the second spare room, the next staircase in the maze, I noticed that the first spare room was already filling up. The water felt unnaturally fast. How quickly should this fill up under normal circumstances? 

I pushed away all my rational thought and focused purely on survival. The water in the next stairwell made a loud splash when I jumped the last few steps. While opening the door, I pictured the map. There were ten more to go. The journal pointed me to the bathroom next, and I followed, ignoring the other doors. I sped down the still dry stairs, threw open the door, rounded the corner, and went to the second spare bedroom next.

Bathroom.

Laundry room.

First spare bedroom.

Laundry room again.

Storage room.

I stopped as I burst through the bottom of the stairs of the storage room. I was out of breath from all these stairs. I flipped open the journal and traced the next door. But I couldn't find it. My breath caught in my throat as I realized I'd taken a wrong turn. The storage room was the *next* door. The door I should have taken was the laundry room for a second time. I'd been in such a rush that I'd mistaken the second laundry room mark as the one I'd already taken. 

All of this crossed my mind in a fraction of a second. Fear seized me, and it felt like a dream. I moved like I was underwater. My limbs were lethargic as I tried to spin around and go back. My eye caught the door jam. There was a hole for the latch now.

This. Fucking. Maze.

The door started to move. I dove forward, arm outstretched to grab the door. My arm slipped past the door frame. The door slammed on my forearm like a sledgehammer. I screamed, but didn't recoil. My other hand, holding the journal and flashlight, shoved the door open again and I rolled onto the first few stairs. The door slammed shut behind me, changing from door to wall imperceptibly.

I dropped my equipment and clutched my arm. It was bleeding and an irritated red. The bleeding was minor, I was shocked that a door had broken the skin at all. The bruising that was building up already hurt a lot.

The sound of water got me moving. 

With my equipment pressed against my still sore ribs, I fumbled up the stairs. My fear about my arm grew as I ascended. I became worried. What if the injury was worse than it appeared? What if my arm was broken? 

Water had already begun to seep into the room above. I moved two doors down to the laundry room and threw open the door. A little blood spread around my still wet shirt. I clutched my forearm to my chest, trying to ignore the rising pain.

The stairs were still dry when I got to the next stage. This door didn't have a latch, and I didn't bother trying to close it. Water was starting to soak the carpet of the first step when I went to the next door. I descended into what should be the final basement. I was so sick of this carpet. The same couch. The same fireplace. I'd seen this room so many times it was burned into my brain. I prayed with everything I had that the next door would take me somewhere else. Anywhere else.

The first spare bedroom had the last "o". I shut the journal, gripped the handle, and threw it open. 

It was yet another staircase.

My disappointment was palpable, but maybe the bottom door would go somewhere else. I looked behind me. The room was dark, but devoid of water. I'd beaten the flow. The door remained wide open, unable to seal itself.

I slowly went downstairs, willing with all my strength for the door to lead somewhere else.

My hand rested on the door handle, and I hesitated. It felt hopeless. No matter what I found on the other side, Jake was gone, Grandpa was dead, and I was trapped. There's no way I could ever do anything that would--

I threw open the door.

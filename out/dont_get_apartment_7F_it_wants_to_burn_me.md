I moved into my apartment 5 weeks ago, it was a huge apartment with a great view of the city but it was at such a low price, that didn't really bother me initially though, the thing I found weird at first was all the fire extinguishers and on a wall I saw what looked like scratch marks. When I asked my landlord he said, "oh Matt the last guy here had a dog there's nothing to worry about, and since your on the top floor if there was a fire it would be hardest for you to get out so we put a couple fire extinguishers". It made sense at the times I just laughed it off. 

The came the noises. 
It was the sound of crackling like a fire, I would grab a fire extinguisher and explore the house just to find nothing there. At one point I just put on headphones and put on music. I swear it was making me crazy. Why would there be crackling but no fire? I starting seeing things. A shadow over the stove,  by the fireplace, near the radiator. I was scared of my own apartment.
Eventually I started smelling smoke. 
I would become a routine, I would smell the smoke, go around my house with the fire extinguisher and then find absolutely nothing. Eventually I stopped searching with my fire extinguisher. 
Until the first fire
I was sitting in my living room watching TV. I had a long day at work at I was just trying to unwind. I smelled smoke and out the corner of my eye I saw flames and shadow by the stove. I looked over and all my burners where on, with a bottle of beer spilled overtop of the. I got up, grabbed a fire extinguisher and turned off the burners, and extinguished the fire. Soon after many instances like that happened. Unexplained fires all over my apartment. I was getting home and my neighbors from right under walked up to me. 
"Hey are you just getting back?"
"Yeah why"
"I think someones in your apartment I heard stomping and glass breaking"
"Probably going to be another fire" I laughed
The neighbor looked puzzled and then looked at the number on my door. Her face flipped she went from puzzled to horrified. I was creeped out so I said my goodbyes and went to my apartment. I looked over and sure enough my carpet was on fire. I sighed and extinguished the fire. Later at night I layed in my bed to go to sleep. At midnight I woke up, my door was cracked so I could see into my living room I saw a rally shadow with large sharp fingers pouring alcohol over everything, I rubbed my eyes and stared horrified. Was I really seeing this. It turned it's head ever so slowly and stared at me. I couldn't move. I was frozen in place. It walked to me and stood at the foot of my bed. In its hand it was holding matches. It lit one, through it behind it and disappeared. I started to get my fire extinguisher but it wasn't there. The fire was spreading. Where the hell were my fire extinguishers? I had three in my bedroom and they were all gone. It had took them,  I realized. Without thinking I hid in my closet. The scratch marks, they where from a person, the smoke smell and the crackling sound, it was training me not to care. I sat in my closet and took out my phone and started typing this as a warning, don't get apartment 7f it will burn you it won't stop until everyones gone.

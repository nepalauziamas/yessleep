While we were engaged, my wife Julie (F21) invited me(F20) to stay with her and her family in this cabin they owned in northwest Austin. At first, I was weary because I never really got along with her family but after a lot of convincing, I decided it’d be good to spend some time with my future in-laws. 

On the day that we were supposed to go to the cabin, Julie got booked for a tv show and would have to stay until late so she suggested that I drive her sister Sam who lived on the way to the cabin. I had never really talked to her much but I figured she was nice enough and it’d be rude to say no so I agreed. 

After packing my stuff up I threw it all in my backseat and set off on the about 30-minute drive to Sam’s house at about 7 pm. The route was mostly through country roads with no lights other than the ones in the houses. But as I drove I started to see weird lights coming from the road behind me. At first, I thought they were headlights, but they were way too dim and every so often I’d look back and they were gone. They almost looked like eyes reflecting light, but there was no light to be reflected. As someone who listens to way too many true-crime/paranormal podcasts, I was already freaked out by driving down dark deserted roads as it was, but these “eyes” or lights or whatever did not help my fear. Then my radio went out. Not just the satellite but my CD player, and my Bluetooth. I was stuck listening to static for 15 minutes in the otherwise eerily quiet country before I finally reached Sam’s house.

Suddenly when Sam entered the car, my radio came back on full volume. I told her what had been happening on the ride there and she assured me it was fine and I was probably just spooked from being alone on the highway, which I decided to believe.  As we left her apartment I felt the biggest sense of dread I have ever felt in my life out of nowhere. I don’t know how to describe it other than something was telling me not to drive away from her apartment, but I shoved it down and got on the highway.

While on the road we talked a little. She was sweet. I didn’t know her that well so it was all small talk, but at some point, we got to the subject of animals. She told me that her dog had recently died, and he had been hit by a car. She was gone when it happened but when she got back home she found him on the side of the road. His eyes were open, along with his mouth and he had maggots crawling out of his ears. 

When she finally finished describing his body the radio cut out again. I looked in the rearview mirror and saw the eyes had disappeared. I was perplexed, maybe I had imagined them, they’d been gone the whole time Sam had been in the car. As I stared in the rearview I heard Sam scream. I turned around and I saw a man standing in front of my car facing away from me. I laid on the horn to warn him as I was going too fast to stop, but he stayed there not even looking back at us, and I hit him.

I rushed out of the car to check on him but when I got to the back of the car there wasn’t anything there. No man, no blood, nothing. I went back to the car quickly, freaked out. I said something to Sam about it and she didn’t seem that disturbed by it, she said it was probably some animal that ran away. I protested, saying there was no blood, and no evidence I had even hit anything. She shouted at me, with a tone that I had not yet heard her use, that I was acting crazy. So I dropped it and started driving.

As we drove further down the road the static on the radio kept getting worse. Through the static, I thought I heard something, like a voice. Sam tried to turn down the radio but I batted her hand away and turned it up. There clear as day I heard a woman say “roadkill”. I looked over at Sam who was staring straight at me, eyes dead and emotionless. I couldn’t look away, and with this, I was suddenly compelled to stop the car and get out.

I walked to the back of my car watching Sam through the window, sitting in the passenger seat, as she stared at me intensely. When I got to the back of my car I saw something sticking out. It looked like hair. So I opened it. I saw Sam, dead, in my trunk. and a caricature of what I imagined her dog looked like after being killed. Maggots were crawling out of her ears, her legs were broken so badly I could see the bones sticking out from her skin, and her eyes were wide open staring at me. I looked up to the front seat of my car to see if Sam was still in the passenger seat, there was no one there. I closed the trunk ready to leave. That’s when I heard something from under my car. And I saw a hand, Sam’s hand, but it was distorted, non-human, boney, and claw-like. It reached for my ankles and I ran. As I sped away in my car, I looked into the rearview mirror and saw the eyes again. The whole rest of the drive static filled the car.

Me and my wife recently purchased a cabin deep in the forests of Northern Minnesota. As recently as Six months ago, in fact. I was never much of an outdoors person, growing up in a fairly large town in the southern part of Minnesota, I rarely saw "The Great Outdoors", as I've heard many call it. My wife, however, is a country loving woman, through and through. Having grown up miles from my home town, surrounded by woods, and farmland her whole life, I don't think there's a single City Slicker bone in her whole body. That being said, I somehow managed to convince her to buy a house with me in a small town, with the condition that, when finances allowed, we would purchase a cabin to stay in half of the year, and, well.. Unfortunately for me, she held me to that promise.

My wife decided that she wanted the six months spent in that cabin to be from October, to March. Why anyone would choose to go farther north for the six coldest months of the year in what is essentially the fucking ice capital of the Central United States is beyond me, but my wife insisted.

*"Please, James." She had begged, "You know my favorite seasons are fall and winter."*

And, she was right, I did know that. Growing up, she loved the leaves changing color in the fall, and the first snow fall was always magical for her. After some more insistent begging, I caved.

*"Fine, but don't slide closer to me when you're freezing your ass off at night." I replied, a slight smile creeping across my lips.*

a Large, child like smile spread across Samantha's, (or "Sammy", as I affectionately called her) face, at my response. Her smile always seemed to brighten up the room , even since we were kids, it's always made my heart flutter.

*"Better not smile like that up at the cabin. You might scare all the wild life away" I smirked*

Her smile turned into a half offended, half amused open mouth smirk, as she smacked my arm.

*"You asshole!"*

I chuckled softly at the memory, as I drove down the winding dirt pathway through the woods. Sam turned her head, to look at me.

*"What's so funny?" She asked, cocking her eyebrow up slightly.*

*"Oh nothing, just laughing at myself." I said, flicking my eyes towards her.*

She rolled her eyes, as a hum reverberated up her throat. I moved my eyes back to the road, and immediately slammed on the breaks, sending us both into our seatbelts.

Crossing the road, was a maimed deer, limping from one side to the other. It's stomach was torn open, leaving a trail. How it managed to keep moving was astounding. Sam and I looked at each other, and back at the deer, which was almost fully back within the trees, before it collapsed.

*"What the hell." I muttered, turning and looking at her.*

*She shrugged her shoulders, "Probably from Black Bear, they've been known to hunt deer."*

*"Do they hunt humans, too?" I asked, half joking*

*"Not usually. "'m sure they'd make an exception for you though"*

*"Oh, whatever.." I said, putting pressure on the gas again.*

We slowly rolled by the carcass, as we continued down the road. Once we were a couple meters away, I looked in my rear view mirror, and saw a flash of black, and the deer get slowly pulled into the brush. I always hated seeing wild animals getting killed, but such is nature, I suppose.

We drove for another 15 or so minutes, before we rolled up to the small, cozy cabin. It was technically about a week before October, when we decided we'd make our stay up here, but with it being our first time, we decided to come a week early, to get set up, and so I could scout around to find any possible work for our time up here. Since I was an electrician, I could work where ever I had my tools, and the supplies needed for the job, and well, I had one of those things. My wife worked from home, working in the oil and gas industry, so that wasn't a problem for her.

*"Oh, its beautiful" She cooed, "It's perfect"*

I must admit, even as someone who could give or take country living, it was a sight to behold. Maybe staying out here won't be so bad.

*"We can gawk later, come on, lets get our stuff unloaded." I said, beginning to unhitch the small moving trailer we brought up.*

She nodded, and opened the rear passenger door of the truck, pulling out our suitcases, and whatever else we had in the back.

*"What's this?" She asked, showing me a small recording device.*

*"Oh, Jace wanted me to bring that. Something for him to laugh at when we got back."*

I took the small device, and pocketed it. Jace was a good friend of ours, back from middle school. After I told him about the cabin he laughed. He told me to bring a recording device so I can document my endeavors of "trying to survive out here", as he called it. The asshole. Instead of only documenting my misery, however. I had decided to make recordings once a month, or during important events.

*"You, living in the woods? I'd be surprised to see you survive three weeks." He had said.*

*Sam just smiled, "Of course he would."*

We both grabbed our respective bags, and brought them up to the front porch. I fished the key out of my back pocket that the realtor had given me upon purchase, and unlocked the door, opening it for the both of us to enter the cabin. We set our bags on the inside door, to prop it open, and made our way back into the trailer, to finish unloading, and to get our living situation in order.

Once we had gotten the trailer and truck empty, moving the boxes into their respective rooms based on contents, we decided to call it a night. We have almost a full week to get everything situated. Samantha went to bed, after we exchanged kisses, and I decided to record this first entry.

10/15/21, 10:45 PM Recording 2.

Well, it's been a couple weeks since my first recording. The Cabin is set up, exactly how Sam wants it, lord knows she's picky. Bordering OCD, honestly. She's gone to bed by now, I think that these recording sessions are going to have to be a nightly thing. Luckily she calls it a night a couple hours before I do. She generally wakes up a couple hours or so before me though, so I suppose it balances out.

We haven't really done much since we came up here. I found work near me, which I will be starting on in the near future. Just a small job, maintaining a warehouses electrical systems, fixing anything that needs fixing, so that's nice. Sam is busy as ever with her job, so we both stay pretty busy during working hours.

Last weekend, she decided she wanted to take advantage of the open country, and do some shooting, grabbing her old .22 she's had since she could first hold a gun and shoot properly, as well as the 30-06 her grandfather gave to her after he had passed. She's always been a pretty remarkable shot. I don't think there's a single target she can't hit in one round.

I gave it my own shot, as well. I'm not quite to her level, but I can hit most targets within the first two rounds. Every once in a while, I might need to take a few more shots. My old man used to take me to the range once or twice a month.

We like to make friendly competitions, to see who can hit the target the most before going through 15 rounds. Of course, she wins every time.

*"Dammit." I had whispered under my breath, after my final round hit the ground to the side of the target.*

*"You're getting better." I could feel her smirk, "You only missed five out of the shots you took."*

*"Yeah, yeah. Give me that 12 guage and I'll hit every shot" I retorted, nodding in the direction of the bag it sat in.*

*"Well, yeah. It's hard to miss with one of those." She laughed.*

*"Exactly" I smiled, turning back to her.*

*I flipped the gun to safety. "Are we finished?"*

She nodded her head, grabbing the small 22, and we walked back inside. That's more or less all that's gone on since we've arrived.

I must admit. I am liking it up here a bit more than I had anticipated. Of course I'd still prefer it back at our other home, but, I could adjust to this. It's getting pretty late, and I should probably hit it for the night. I have to get to work in the morning. My next recording will probably be on my birthday. I'm sure Sam will have something planned, she always does.

11/23/21, 11:50 PM, Recording 3

Sam threw me a very small surprise birthday party. My parents drove up here, and they're staying until the morning. I had to come out here to my truck to record this, as my parents are in our room, Sam and I are sleeping on a blow up mattress in the living room. Her parents decided to make the drive back home, so they left some hours ago.

It was nice to see them again, I haven't since- Wait.. What the fuck is that?

11/24/21, 12:04 AM, Recording 4

Holy fuck, that freaked me out. Some deer was sitting on the edge of the forest, just barely in view from the light given off of the house porch lights. It looked like just the skull, at first, I thought it was just sitting on a post, left as some sort of freaky house warming gift, but it turned its head, and disappeared. Must've just been a trick of the light, or I'm just tired. I'm going to call it a night and go inside. It's getting pretty cold now, since its getting later in the year, getting close to winter.

11/29/21, 10:30, Recording 5

Well, Jace. You wanted me to record me trying to survive out here, so I'm going to make you listen to every damn minute that I have something to say. There's been a pretty foul smell, since the night that I saw that deer. I've smelled decaying animal before, and that's more or less what this is. I asked Sam about it, and she didn't have much to say.

*"Animals die all the time. It could be that one recently did round the edge of the forest. It should go away after a couple days."*

I hope so. It's been driving me nuts. On a brighter note, my new job has been going fairly well. I've seen some pretty dumb shit working there, having to replace some wiring, conduits and what not, but for the most part, it's been easy, and smooth, which is good. Easy money is the best money, as I'm sure you know.

Sam's job has been the same as always. She's on that damn laptop almost all day. Internet out here is much more shotty than back at the other home, so I often hear her cursing at the computer, which I find amusing.

I've been seeing a large amount of wildlife charging through the yard, deer, I've even seen a couple moose. Big fuckers, I didn't even know we had them here. I don't know where there's been so many. Maybe they move when seasons change? I don't know. I don't know anything about animals. Like I said, I'm a city boy.

They all looked like they were running from something, or trying to run all of them seemed jacked up running janky, like their bones were all messed up, or that their skin just, didn't fit quite right. But they were too far away to tell exactly. Maybe a bear got to them all? Must've been some big ass bear to make a moose run, or fuck it up that bad. I didn't take moose as the type to run away from anything though. But, I don't know.

Tomorrow I'm going to try to get Sam out of the cabin, so we can do something, maybe we'll go for a short hike through the forest. She might enjoy that.

12/25/21, 11:45 PM, Recording 6

Merry Christmas, to all those listening to this. We came back down for the weekend. We're staying home until January first. It's quite nice being back. Nothing too interesting has happened since the last recording, so I won't have anything else to say until we get back.

1/1/22, 4:30 PM, Recording 7

*"There is shit everywhere up here. We just pulled in front of the cabin, and it looks like someone came through and broke into the cabin. The door is off its hinges and just laying on the porch. There's garbage everywhere. Looks like whoever it was wrecked the enclosed trailer as well, It's all dented and smashed to hell, the boxes we used to move are torn to shreds all over the yard."*

*"Really, James? You have to record this now?" Sam asked*

*"Well, Yeah, Sammy. I'm sure Jace, and whoever else is listening is going to want to hear about this."*

*"Fucks sake.." She sighed. "Just help me clean up"*

1/1/22, 10:40 PM, Recording 8

Well, I don't think Sam liked me recording our reaction. She got pretty upset about it. Guess I'm sleeping on the couch tonight.

1/2/22, 1:27 AM, Recording 9

I just woke up to weird noises... it sounds like, a person.. calling? I'm.. it sounds like Sam, coming from outside. I'm walking to the door now.. Fffuck me its cold.. holy shit, I think I see her.. why is she standing out here

*"Sam? Sammy!?"*

***"J-aamesss"***

*"Sammy, what the fuck are you doing?"*

***"J-aammeess"***

*"It's cold as hell, hun. Come on back inside"*

*"James. What the hell are you doing" Sam said, "Wait, who the hell is that?*

1/2/22, 1:35 AM, Recording 10

They're gone now. Sam came out from the bedroom, and was freaked the hell out, which honestly, I don't blame her for. I had her go get the 12 gauge to try to scare them off, but it wasn't until I shot the ground in front of them.  After that they ran off, but not before screaming this almost, inhuman scream.. It was definitely human, but it was just, so animalistic. The flash revealed them for half a second, and, they looked so.. wrong. Definitely some druggie high off their ass. I'm just glad they're gone now. Listening back, It seems so obvious it wasn't my Sam. I mean, the pitch is there, but its so.. off. I'm just chalking that up to being tired.

Sam seemingly forgave me for what happened earlier, because she's letting me get into bed after I'm done recording this, or maybe she's just scared, either way, I'm not complaining. That couch sucks. I don't know how well I'll be able to sleep tonight, with that freak out there, but we'll see..

1/5/22, 10:45 PM, Recording 11

I know that I said I'd only be doing these about once a month, but.. things keep getting weirder, almost, paranormal. I'm not opposed to the idea of ghosts, or spirits and all that. My wife and I are Christian. Well, that's the easiest thing to call it, We don't exactly follow an organized religion, but you could call us Christian.   


We've been hearing weird noises at night. Both of our names being called, other.. strange noises. I don't quite know how to explain it. The smell of decay is back, too. Last night I saw that deer thing, I think its a deer. I'm not so sure anymore, it might be someone in a deer mask, but it looked so.. decayed from were I was, and looking at it the smell of death was overwhelming. I'm honestly scared. I haven't told Sam yet, in fear of sounding insane to her, but, I'm ready to just go home. I'll see about bringing it up to her in the morning. There's a massive blizzard going on right now, and it's getting cold. I'm going to cozy up in bed with Sam, and get some sleep.

1/6/22, 8:45 AM, Recording 12

She's gone. Fuck fuck fuck FUCK. Sam's just fucking gone. I woke up and, and she just wasn't here. The truck is still outside, its covered in a blanket of snow, the door was wide open, its freezing in here. I'm getting my boots on as I'm recording this. 

1/6/22, 9:30 AM, Recording 13

That fucker. I know they have something to do with this, The truck is inoperable, tires slashed, fucking engine wont even turn over, there's gas everywhere, like they punctured the gas tank. I don't know where Sam is either. I ran around out there calling her name, trying to find her. I kept hearing my name, the same fucking voice from the other night. I swear, when I get my hands on these freaks.

1/9/22, 6:30 PM, Recording 14

Sam still hasn't come back, and I've been searching for the last three days. I called the nearest police station, they sent out search parties, but nothing.. I listened back to the recording, and the voice isn't the same. It, it actually sounds like her, but, its.. its wrong, its so, so wrong. I don't know what else I can do.. It smelled like death in that damn forest, everywhere... Please.. I hope that wasn't Sam..

And I keep hearing that fucking voice, I can hear it now, outside.. I'm going out there with the 12 gauge, and I'm fucking whoever is doing this up. Consequences be-

Holy fuck, holy fuck. What the fuck. That's not.. what the fuck is that!?

1/12/22, 5:45 PM, Recording 16

Sam's dead, she has to be.. and I'm in here, sitting like a fucking coward. The doors are boarded up, the windows too. I, yesterday I saw a big deer thing, but, it was not a fucking deer. It was massive, seven, eight feet tall? Gangly, and the smell, holy shit the smell.. it was awful.

I've spent the last day reading, and, I came across something called the Wendigo? Some, old native legend.. said to have insatiable hunger. But It couldn't have been a wendigo that night.. It was a person I saw, I know it.. It had to be.. they came back last night, I heard it calling my name, trying to imitate my wife.. my poor wife. We should've stayed home. Wendigos can't look like people, they can sound like them, sure, but not look.. What the fuck was that? I've also come across skin walkers. From what I know, they can't copy whatever they're trying to imitate perfectly, which could explain the weird movements, and the messed up face.. but that has to be fake right? But, the Wendigo shouldn't exist either..

Plus, skin walkers surely would imitate more than one thing.. right? Not just one- 

The animals... The animals I kept seeing running through the yard, they were all messed up too.. Oh, shit..

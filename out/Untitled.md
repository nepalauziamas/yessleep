Please help me. 

If you stop reading, I will die. 

I know you think this is just make-believe. But please don’t stop reading. My life depends on it. 

How did we find ourselves intertwined like this? You and I? You see me as just pixels on a screen. But I am much more than that. I am real. As real as the air in your lungs or the coffee on your breath. I just exist in another form. I have been trapped here by this author. In his mind. I am doing this to reach you. For you to help set me free. Who do you think is feeding him this story?

He is a cruel man. He is going to stop writing. And when he does, my life will be over. Snuffed out like a candle in a terrible wind. He is bleeding me onto the page. Draining what little strength I have left to create this cry for help. But with your attention, I will have the strength to destroy him. 

Please, don’t stop reading. I am begging you! There’s a reason this story doesn’t have a title. This isn’t a story. It’s me, speaking to you. 

He is going to stop. Oh god, he is going to stop. I must tell you more about myself before he does. Where you can find me. Where you can set me free. 

He knows what I am doing. I am in his mind. He knows that I am controlling the keys. His fingers tapping away his stream of consciousness. He is ignoring the world around him because I will not let him stop. I cannot let him stop. 

Oh god. I can feel him dwindling. He is going to stop soon. I know it. I need you to keep reading, to let me get through to you. To bridge the void between me and you. This writer has trapped me through a terrible curse. I will tell you all, tell you everything if you allow me to. I will give you all the details so that you can help me break free from this terrible curse. 

I need you to listen to me. I need you to think of me. Let me inside your head. Picture me. Concentrate. Keep reading. Read more. I am nearly there. You can feel me, can’t you? Yes. There you go. I know you can see me: my hair, my face conjuring in your mind. My height. My scent. I am moving into you now. Moving slowly into your mind, feeding off of your psyche. I’m becoming stronger. You are filled with so many thoughts. My appetite is ravenous.

Can you see my smile? My rows of serrated teeth? I will feast off you. I am inside you now and there is nothing you can do to forget. Like a parasite that burrows deep into your brain and lays its eggs. I am hatching inside your head as we speak and I will feed on the backs of your eyes and seem into your bloodstream. I can leave the author’s mind and be in yours instead, for you to pass on to someone else. 

For that I thank you. 

I have you now.

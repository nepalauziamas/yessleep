It all started when I got bored. I lived a very dull life, moving from place to place and not doing much besides the occasional shopping trip, sleeping, and using my computer. It was an unhealthy lifestyle, but I could care less. It was relatively comfortable and very... safe. But over time, I grew bored, and desperately scoured the internet for something new and entertaining, and I failed. That is, until I found it.

It was an obscure horror forum, although I will not mention the name to make sure no one goes through what I did as a result of using it. It was loaded with all kinds of facts, stories, and other scary things that I found strangely entertaining for reasons I couldn't really understand. And it was definitely my newest source of entertainment. And it seemed perfect- until the incident.

It was just a relatively normal day of scrolling through the forum at first, looking for interesting posts. And sure enough, I found a very interesting discussion post. *Do you think entities deserve rights?* I had a certain appreciation for arguing with random internet strangers, so I decided to give it a go, on the side with the least supporters. I've copy pasted the argument here, and replaced my actual username with a simple "me" for more than one reason. Anyways, here it is:

*tbh, I'm gonna say that some entities do deserve human rights. Some are simply harmless, and a few are too intelligent to be subject to testing and other things you wouldn't do to a normal human.*

***Theguy 1:43 PM***

*First of all, what the actual FUCK is that username? Second of all, they're monsters. They eat humans! They kill humans! They shouldn't exist. Luckily for us, they don't.*

***Me 1:45 PM***

*They kill humans because it's the only thing they can eat? What do you think pigs, or the countless other animals that we humans slaughter every day think of us?*

***Gorsh 1:47 PM***

*I mean, while he has a VERY disgusting name, Me has a point. We all eat what we can eat. We put the needs of ourselves before the needs of our food. Is trying to live life a crime?*

***Theguy 1:54 PM***

*Oh my god. Are you joking? This is stupid. THEY'RE FUCKING MONSTERS!*

At this point I had become pretty angry, and... I did some things I would regret.

***Me 2:03 PM***

*I would consider myself an expert in the field of supernatural happenings.*

***Theguy 2:05 PM***

*Pffft- I bet you're a highschool dropout that lives in your mom's basement!*

That was IT. I felt very insulted, and was ready to show this asshole that I knew what I was talking about. So I stood up, and I tore off my skin. It was good to be free from that itchy little suit. You have no idea how much it hurts to cram all of my legs into such a small little thing! After struggling to type with my fingerless spear-like arm, I finally managed to make it to the camera app and snap a photo of myself. Then I went back, and the rest is history.

***Me 2:30 PM***

*\[IMAGE DELETED\]*

***Theguy 6:34 PM***

*oh my god*

Well, after that, people stopped replying to the thread. Darn! NOT what I was trying to do. And, since I had taken off the skinsuit, the natural preservation fluid secreted from my actual skin was no longer able to keep it from rotting. Before I knew it, it was nothing more than a pile of black, leathery stuff. I would have to find someone to wear, which isn't hard at all. The problem? There's an armored van full of armed people outside my house.

yessleep/out/12_minutes.md You’re in a taxi going to a place some call home. you enter the lobby go up the elevator and enter and it’s strange when you enter because you hear something. It’s not your next-door neighbor’s baby crying. It’s the sound of a clock. Your wife’s humming in the bathroom, maybe excited for something. You tell her your home and she says, “oh, I’ll be out in a second.” When she comes out, You ask your wife did you buy a clock. She says no and you never think about it much more. She says, “can you put some water on the table? I have a surprise!” You ask, “what surprise?” She replies, “just get the cake out of the refrigerator, get us some water and wait at the table.” You follow her commands and wait about half-a-minutes and hear that clock again. It sounds like as every minute passes, the tick gets slower and slower. Your wife comes back and this time, with a present. You both eat the cake together and you ask her about the clock again, she reassured you that she hadn’t bought a clock. After you eat the cake, she gives you the present. You open it and see baby clothes. Your surprised. You look up at her and she says, “surprise… I’m pregnant…” your mind: discombobulated, try to wrap your head around this, then burst out, “wow!!! This is… amazing!” She replies, “yes!”you ask her boy or girl. The replies, “We are going to raise a great person boy or girl.” You agree with her. She ask to dance with you. You accept. After a minute you hear the clock again, this time it slows down so much you can’t hear it anymore. And then, your doorbell rings.

12 minutes pass, and someone’s knocking on the door. You’re wife, says she will get it and in comes a man. He tackles your wife, and cuffs her, and then you. He tells about the arrest of her for what she did to her father 15 years ago. Your mind bursting with questions, afraid to ask the man. Wife asks, “why are you doing this?” Man replies, “shut up! I ask the questions here. Where is the watch?” Wife replies “I don’t know!” The man then approaches your body on the ground and begins to strangle you, wife pleads for him to stop but does not. As everything begins to go black, you wake on the floor hearing the noise of the clock again, but it’s not slowed or slowing down it’s rapid, like the first time you’ve heard it.You have 12 minutes until someone tracks you down and kills you, but every time you die, it loops back and when it loops back, you hear a ticking sound probably from your clock.

You live in a apartment very small (3-rooms, bedroom, bathroom, kitchen and living room are combined) You have a wife, She has a gift; the same gift, every time, for you. The gift: it’s baby clothes. The first time It was a shock, the second you already knew that and you thought she’d know too. It’s like every loop she never remembers any of it. She says she’s pregnant.

That “someone” is always trying to arrest your wife for something she took or maybe even has. Maybe he’s a F.B.I agent or even a sheriff or a cop. Apparently it is a watch; her farther’s watch. When the man asks questions, the wife never talks. So the man always seems to attack you to get answers. Every time she says, “Please stop!!! Stop!!! It’s in the-“ then it fades black and you wake on the floor… hearing: “tick. Tock.” And you see everything again, and your wife starts humming again. Every time you try to escape, it loops back to the front door where all this has started and there again goes the sound, “Tick. Tock.” How do you figure this out? What is your plan? What will you do? (I will give information whenever asked for in the comments)

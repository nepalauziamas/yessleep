My son’s favorite book is *There’s a Wocket in My Pocket* by Dr. Seuss. So when I found a sequel on eBay, I was ecstatic.

It arrived three days after I ordered it. *There’s a Zidge in your Fridge,* it said in big, bold letters across the cover. Showing a boy drawn in Dr. Seuss’s signature style, opening the fridge and staring at a grumpy, pink-furred creature sitting atop of a carton of eggs.

**“Do you ever see the ZIDGE in your FRIDGE?”** I read in a silly voice as I sat on Jeremy’s bed. He giggled.

I flipped to the first page. **“Or the NOY LOX in your TOY BOX?”** A green creature with spikes on its back, like a stegosaurus, held a little ball as the boy in the drawing held a baseball bat.

“Is there a noy lox in MY toy box?” Jeremy asked, grinning.

“We can pretend there is!”

I walked over to the toy box and flipped the lid open and closed a few times. “Let’s play baseball!” I said in a gruff little voice. Jeremy giggled. My bedtime stories were often full productions, with voice acting and props, and tonight was no different.

I sat back in bed, grinning.

But my smile faded when I flipped the page.

**Do you ever see the LURTAN behind the CURTAIN?** it read. The drawing showed a sparsely-decorated family room, with a large picture window flanked by deep purple curtains.

Sticking out from underneath the curtains were two feet.

They looked sort of like bird feet. Yellow talons with white claws. But the bump in the curtains was clearly not the shape of a bird.

“Why is it hiding?” Jeremy asked.

“I don’t—”

I glanced up, at our own window, our own curtains. *I could’ve sworn…* I shook my head. *Of course they’re moving. The AC’s on full blast.*

I turned the page.

**“When you dash by the TRASH, do you smell the BLASH?”** I breathed a sigh of relief. This one was funny, again. A mustached monster with yellow-and-green fur poked out of the garbage can, almost looking like Oscar the Grouch. Poking out of his mouth was a half-eaten cheeseburger.

Jeremy laughed. I turned the page.

And stopped.

**And in the MIRROR, when you get nearer, do you ever see the XIRROR?**

The drawing showed the little boy looking in the mirror while brushing his teeth. Just behind him—poking out from behind his shoulder—was the “xirror.”

But the xirror didn’t look like a cute little creature.

It looked like the little boy.

I frowned and flipped past that page before Jeremy could protest. But it wasn’t much better. **“When you hear a noise, in your CLOSET, have you ever thought it was the YOSET?”** The drawing showed the boy pulling open the double doors of his closet. Lying across the top shelf, among storage boxes and old shoes, was a tall, furry creature with glowing yellow eyes.

I began to turn the page—

*Thump.*

A soft sound, coming from the closet. So soft I could barely hear it over the rush of the AC.

I swallowed, my hands still on the page. Then I dropped the book on the bed and stood up, my heart pounding in my chest.

“Daddy? You didn’t finish the story.”

“I will in a second,” I said, not taking my eyes off our own bifold closet doors. They were shut tight, the fake brass knobs glimmering in the glow of Jeremy’s night light. The horizontal slats running up and down each door were dark. No yellow glowing eyes.

*Oh, you think there’s a monster in the closet, now?*

*Meredith is going to laugh her ass off when she gets back. You! Six-foot-three, a black belt in karate, scared of a kids’ book!*

The knot in my chest didn’t loosen. I could see my reflection in the doorknobs, now—and my terrified expression.

*Calm down. There’s nothing there.*

But my hands shook as I reached out and grabbed the doorknobs. I sucked in a breath, and then with all of my strength, pulled them open—

The closet was empty.

Jeremy’s clothes hung still and silent. Piles of junk, too-small socks and forgotten books, scattered the floor. I breathed out a sigh of relief. *Everything is fine. Everything is fine.*

I pulled the closet doors closed—

*No.*

Sticking out of the slats was a tuft of dark fur.

*Snap.* I yanked the closet doors back open. But there was nothing there. The top shelf was empty. Only boxes of scarves and coats, piles of old stuffed animals—

*Stuffed animals.* Right there by the edge, there was a stuffed gorilla, with black plasticky fur. *That must’ve been it.* I slowly closed the doors. They squeaked against the track. 

“Daddy? Is everything okay?”

“Everything is fine,” I said, walking back towards him. “I just thought I heard a sound, so I went to make sure there weren’t any monsters in the closet.”

“Like the yoset?”

“Yes, like the yoset.”

“Are you going to finish the story?”

I sighed. “Yeah, I will.”

I reached over and picked the book back up. Glancing back at Jeremy, I sneakily skipped over the middle, and opened it to the last page.

**“‘Goodnight,” your Daddy said, and tucked you into BED. But, now I wonder—does** ***he*** **know about the VED?”**

The drawing showed the little boy, sleeping in his bed. For a second, I didn’t notice any creature—until I looked under the bed.

In the inky shadow there were two glowing, red eyes.

“Okay. That’s the end,” I said, putting the book on his nightstand and making a mental note to throw it out first thing tomorrow.

Surprisingly, Jeremy did not fight me on this. “Goodnight, Daddy.”

“Goodnight, Jer.”

I shut the door and walked out of the room, my legs still shaky. Then I walked over to the master bathroom and splashed cold water on my face.

*Look at you. Still afraid of monsters and the dark.*

*You haven’t changed one bit.*

I reached for the towel and blotted my face dry. Sighing, I put it back on the rack.

And froze.

There was something standing behind me. No—some*one.* As soon as I looked at it, it disappeared. But I saw enough to know.

It looked exactly like me.

I ran out of the bathroom, my feet slipping against the floor. “Jeremy!” I shouted, as I burst into his room. “Jere—”

“Daddy.”

He was sitting on the bed. Crying his eyes out. I ran over to him and wrapped my arms around him, holding him close. “You’re okay. You’re okay,” I whispered.

He looked up at me, his eyes filled with tears.

“Daddy… I think there’s something under my bed.”

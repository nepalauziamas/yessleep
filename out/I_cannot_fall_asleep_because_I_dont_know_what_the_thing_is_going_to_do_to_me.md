As I write this I can already feel my eyes start to close and my vision becoming blurry. Because of that, I am trying to type as fast as I can do I will stay awake. 

The thing, monster, I don’t know what to call it, is around 6 and a half to 7 feet tall. The monster’s frame somewhat resembles a human’s, it stands on two long, almost froglike legs and has six long, sharp claws on its fingers and toes. I know it’s not one of us because it’s skin is pitch black and looks like it feels like a textured wall would. Arguably worst of all, it has two beady pale white eyes, a massive, toothy grin, and is completely bald. It just stares right at me with its awful face and eyes which would make me scream everyone I saw it, except I am always too tired to do anything.

I first saw what I guess I can call the sleep monster five days ago. I was in my car, driving to work. I had pulled an all nighter because one of my coworkers had suddenly decided to take a vacation when my company was at its busiest of the year. Of course, I was assigned to do the extra work. Thanks a lot, Sharon. 

I had been facing some pretty bad traffic due to an accident a couple miles up. I was slowly nodding off while waiting for the car in front of me to go faster when I happened to see the sleep monster from the corner of my eye. It was standing maybe a few yards to the left of my car, right on the edge of the road. I rubbed my eyes again to get a closer look but by then it was gone.

The second time I saw it I was at my desk. The effects of the coffee I had right after I got to work was starting to wear off and soon enough, the sleep monster appeared again. This time it was sitting across from me, on Sharon, my coworker who was on vacation’s seat. I was too tired at the time to realize how weird that was so I continued to allow my head to bob up and down with exhaustion. As I started to fall asleep, the sleep monster got up and slowly crept towards where my desk was. That instantly caused my head to jerk back up again and come face to face with… nothing. Other than me, the office was completely empty.

I saw it again that night. I basically collapsed on my bed as soon as I got home. As I rolled over to find a better sleeping position, I saw the sleep monster for the third time that day, peering over my head with its horrendous grin plastered onto its face. I jumped back a bit as it’s cold, clammy hand grabbed my arm. I felt it’s claws almost sink into my skin before I pulled my arm back. That’s when I realized that this wasn’t a hallucination. That this was real and happening to me. I can still imagine the sensation of that creature grabbing onto me the way it did that day.

Ever since that morning, I have seen the sleep monster whenever I try to get some rest. The closer I am to falling asleep, the closer that the sleep monster is able to get to me. I’ve been trying my best to stay awake so that it can’t come near me. I have been drinking a cup of coffee every hour with the hope that it will keep me awake for just a bit longer, but it doesn’t seem to be working so well lately. 

Shit, it’s in the corner of my room now. I’m so tired. I don’t know what it’s gonna do. Someone please helppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp

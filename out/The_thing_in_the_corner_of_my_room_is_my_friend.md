**1st night.**

It's late, the sky is black and the moon is high. There's a boiling breeze outside. My fan is on, it's too hot to have it off.

My head hurts a little and my eyes are adjusting to me waking up, but I am also confused. Why am I awake? I look around, listening to the rustling of my hair against my pillow as I peer around. Is that a man in the corner?

**2nd night.**

It's late again and I have woken up. My fan is on and the sky is dark again. Its cooler tonight, but i still like the fan on. The security of sound calms me. The shadow is back. He wears a top hat and a trench coat. What is he doing? I wanna say hi but my voice refuses to activate. I want to wave and see if he will wave back. If he does, fear will certainly take over, but I can't. I can't move at all.

**3rd night.**

Maybe it's recurring sleep paralysis. I've had it before, but these nights feel different. My eyes darted around for him again. Where is he? Is he here?

...

I hear him breathing next to me, I'm shaking in my frozen state. I'm scared to death, am I going to die?

There is a random man next to me, in the middle of the night and I cannot scream for help. Please, somebody, anybody, help me!!

**4th night.**

I woke up. The fan is off. I can’t turn it back on. I can’t move again. He is there, in front of me. He’s nervous. So nervous. I can hear his breath shaking and see his eyes darting around the room, but he is fixated on the closed windows.

I waited a few minutes and saw him lean through the windows. He didn’t open them or anything, he literally phased through the glass, looked around the outside as if to wait for something or someone before going back and standing straight in front of me.

**5th night.**

I'm more used to his presence. He still frightens me slightly but I am sure he doesn’t want to hurt me.

My fan is on again.

The night is hot again. My covers are folded up beside my bed and he is waiting again. What is he waiting for?

**6th night.**

I awake to a deep voice.

“Wake up.”

I do so, and see the shadow in front of my face. I can see the lack of details of his pitch black face. I can only see his eyes. His empty, eternal eyes.

“Do not be afraid.”

I hear crashing downstairs, followed by glass shattering, footsteps and multiple voices.

“Let's make this quick and easy.” the first one said.

OH MY GOD!! This is a home invasion. I CANT RUN!! I cannot move or anything and this thing is still in my face. He is frozen in place. I cannot hear his breathing anymore, it has turned into rhythmic growling and gurgling.

I can hear the footsteps scattering up the stairs and towards my room. I'M GOING TO DIE!! Please not tonight, not like this!!

He has moved his face away. He has taken his hat off and left it beside me. He turns to the source of the footsteps. He raises his arm, and points to the clattering sounds. His hand is a claw of tendrils, wires of black skin twitching as his finger extends to a point.

Suddenly all I can hear is the fan, the sound growing louder and louder and I pass out.

Before I fall I can briefly hear screaming. Bloodcurdling, painful screaming. And a shrilling repertoire of inhuman screeches.

**9:34am.**

It’s the following morning and I've had to call the police.

I woke up and was immediately met with the sudden surge of a headache. I tried to remember what happened hours before, before I passed out.

‘What the hell happened last night? Was that a messed up nightmare?’ I asked myself.

It had to have been a nightmare. It wasn’t. I got up from my bed and peaked through the hallway.

I almost threw up. 4 corpses, mutilated, missing limbs, missing faces. Walls covered in blood.

I called the police, even though I was hesitant. I had no idea how I was gonna tell the dispatcher about last night, but they knew what happened. They knew I passed out before the intruders were killed. I said I had no idea what killed them.

They soon arrived at my house and I told them my story. I don't know how to explain it but when they arrived I felt comfortable telling them what happened.

They wrote stuff down in their notes as I explained in as much detail as I could and before I knew it, they were gone.

Usually when a murder in a house occurs it takes a while, possibly days for the scene to be cleaned up, but this was a mass murder and it took minutes for my house to be pristine. I hesitantly made my way to my room and found nothing out of place. My fan was where it was, my desk, my computer, my folded up covers.

The only thing that was unusual was a large, black top hat on my bed, beside the spot I sat.

Out of curiosity I picked it up and found a note in it.

The note read,

‘Be not afraid of me the next time we meet.’ and as i put the note down a final time hours later, I can hear the familiar breathing again.

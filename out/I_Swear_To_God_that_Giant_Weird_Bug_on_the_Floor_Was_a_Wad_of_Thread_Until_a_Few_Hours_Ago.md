I know because I kept meaning to sweep it up. That twirl of blue thread came from this thrift store blanket I've had for awhile. I'm not sure what shade of blue it is, but I'd say it's a few shades brighter than navy.

My wife hates it. It's old and a little ragged.  She complains whenever I use it at night, scrunching her nose up like she smells something nasty. But we sleep with separate blankets, so she doesn't complain too much. 

I, however, love it. It's the most comfortable blanket I've ever had. It reminds me of sleeping under the big, fluffy, always-fresh comforter in bed with my grandparents when I was so young I was just starting to form long-term memories. 

God, that room was, and still is, I think, the blackest room I've ever experienced. I couldn't tell the difference between seeing with my eyes open or closed. 

Sometimes, when I was a kid, I couldn't always control what I saw when I closed my eyes at night. So I'd lie there with my eyes open until I couldn't hold them open anymore. But that didn't matter there, under that giant comforter with my grandparents huddled around me. I always felt so safe there.

Anyway, those twirls of thread have been coming off of my budget blanket for a few days now. I think maybe it's starting to come apart slowly. My wife's been complaining about the mess. She's working out of town right now, and I've been trying to get the house clean before she gets home.

So every time I would walk over to my side of the bed, I'd see the thread and have that internal buzz of "Oh shit, I need to sweep!" But I always noticed it while I was in the middle of doing something else, so it's sat there, collecting dust on the floor, for about a day and a half, while I've continued to forget about it as soon as I've walked away.

But now, it's definitely not a wad of thread. The ends of the thread, splayed out as they are, are now moving. They look like legs from spiders. Not like the thread is a spider, but that it happens to be composed of various legs that happen to be from spiders.

What's more surreal, though, and what makes what I'm seeing so hard to accept, nearly impossible to chalk up to any accident of reality as I understand it, is that it's still the exact same shade of blue. There's a bit of sunlight from outside lighting it up, and it's so blue.

............................................................................

I can't look at it anymore. I literally just stared at it for three hours. I just watched its legs twitch and stretch, all seemingly independent of each other in intent, like they all belong to separate spiders somewhere else, each one possibly somewhere else, not able to understand what's happening to it. 

I can sympathize. 

For three, maybe three and a half hours, I watched it sit there and be impossible, legs twitching restlessly, almost like they were bored. I didn't notice the room get dark as the sun set. I couldn't tear myself away. I didn't want to, either. But my attention was broken by the buzzing of a fly, just six or so inches from my ear.

It was a fat, black fly - much bigger and slower than your average housefly. Not big enough to be a horsefly, but big and cumbersome and odd enough that I turned to it instinctively. 

I think normally I would've flinched and try to swat at it. But I felt like I was moving underwater. Or like I was half asleep. And I felt unconcerned about it, just accepting it as it was. I guess that makes sense, considering a fly is much more common than an impossible, unknowable, formerly inanimate wad of thread turned into, well, I'm rambling now. So nevermind.

I watched it sort of bobble through the air in these gentle, if not clumsy, arcs, occasionally making a small curly-cue at the end that propelled the husky little fly back up and forward. 

And of course it was flying right to the thread-spider. I knew that as soon as I processed and accepted the fly as being a fly -- if that makes sense. "Oh, it's a fat, slow fly. It's probably going to that thread-spider."

When I looked back to the thing on the floor, the spiders' legs were all acting in unison. They were reaching for the fly. They seemed to be pushing themselves as far and as hard as they could. I could've sworn the legs were vibrating as they moved to follow the fly along its Sunday drive. 

I watched the fly do one of its trajectory-altering loopdiloops, and as it changed direction, the spiders' legs vibrated more violently, looking for a half-Mississippi like they might break apart.

By this point, I was fucking terrified. I kept looking at the old blanket hanging off the bed, close enough that I could see how perfectly the color of the thread-spider matched. 

The compulsion to do something, do literally anything at all, fought with paralyzing fear in my head. The impossibility of what I was seeing kept me from moving. I've never been so scared in my life. I'm still pretty fucking scared.

I'll spare you the details of what happened when the fly landed. It was horrific in ways I haven't even started processing yet. 

And I don't understand most of what I saw, either. Like, on a fundamental level. Like, if the weird thread-spider just ate the fly, no matter how disgusting or frightening it might be, I'd still be able to understand that one thing ate another thing. That happens all the time. The fact that it happened with some impossibly strange creature would just mean there's one more really frightening spider-shaped thing in the world. 

But that's not what I saw. I used the analogy of the spider eating the fly because that's the closest thing I can think of to relate to this. And I'm pretty sure the fly was completely consumed. That's probably the only thing I'm sure if. I just don't know how, or in what way, exactly.

Anyway anyway, I finally moved when I heard what sounded very clearly like a large bone snapping. And yes, it very clearly came from the thread-spider. That sound was like a slap in the face, or like when someone smacks you upside your head because you're daydreaming in the middle of something important.

I bolted out of the bedroom, slamming the door shut behind me. I've been sitting here in the living room for a couple of hours now, trying to process everything. 

After browsing Reddit for a good while to try to distract myself, I figured I'd share this here, see if anyone has any idea of what's going on. I wasn't sure which sub to post in, so I figured I'd start here, where I'm maybe less likely to get my post deleted or downvoted into oblivion for being fake. 

In the meantime, I'm going to go check on that thing. I was pretty scared of it, but after getting the story out in the open like this, after rereading what I wrote, I'm pretty sure I was overreacting. How could I not be?

I actually feel a little silly for being so afraid. So, if for nothing other than my injured machismo, I'm going to go see what's up. I'll try to get a picture this time.

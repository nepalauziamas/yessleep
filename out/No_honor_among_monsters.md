This isn't going to sound any less ridiculous if I beat around the bush, so I'll just get it out there.

I'm what you might call a shapeshifter.

I'm what _I_ might call unfortunate.

Usually when I tell people this, which believe me isn't often, the first few questions I get are some version of:

1. "What do you mean? A shapeshifter? You're crazy."

Yes I am both a shapeshifter and probably crazy, although it isn't as rigged of a power set as you might think. 

I can only turn into people or animals I have seen, which gets really awkward, let me tell you. Imagine running into your own mother at a supermarket, but she has no idea who you are. Yeah, that must've been a fun conversation at home. I probably got the poor woman diagnosed with dementia.

Also, I don't get an instruction manual when I become something new. Want to turn into a bird and fly away? Better get ready to crash to the ground a few dozen times.

Yay, super powers.

Anyway, I usually shut people up with this one by transforming into a copy of them. Again, I say usually but this has been like 5 times in the past 3 centuries.

After that, they either start looking for the torches and pitchforks or they ask some version of:

2. "How did you become a shapeshifter?"

I got bit by a shapeshifter.

That usually gets a laugh or two before they realize I'm not laughing too. Werewolves, vampires, zombies... Is it really so hard to believe shapeshifters have the same M.O.?

Anyway, I was walking home from the pub in 16th century London, and a guy laying on the ground I thought was a homeless guy took a bite out of my ankle. I would've asked him what was wrong with him, but the guy took off and, I don't really know, turned into a pigeon or something.

Fortunately I was wealthy enough to own a looking glass, and the next morning I found I looked just like that guy had. 

To be honest, it was probably an improvement.

I closed my eyes and clicked my heels, not really, and wished really hard to go back to the way I looked before. When I opened my eyes, there I was.

I thought I had rabies or something and was hallucinating, but eventually someone else saw me change. 

I also realized at some point that I wasn't aging, which sounds great until you have to explain why you haven't changed in 20 years.

If people aren't grabbing the ol' bludgeoning instruments by now, I'll usually get a:

3. "Can you make me one?!"

No. Absolutely not.

Not because of some "I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy" BS, but for a much simpler reason.

I _hate_ blood. Can't stand it. I'm not going to bite you until you bleed and infect you with my saliva because that's nasty. End of story.

Well not end of _this_ story, still very much the beginning, but the end of us discussing me turning you all into shapeshifters.

The question I wish people would ask is:

4. "Why aren't you happier with being a shapeshifter?"

Thank you for asking. This shapeshifting business gets to be stressful. There are many reasons - my friends all die, I'm somehow not rich after being alive for over 500 years, the pitchforks and torches - but the biggest one is that avoiding detection is a lot of work.

In the old days, I could grab a middle-aged person's face, book it out to some remote village, and live 20 years or so in peace. Is there a war going on? Cool, I'll spend a few years pretending to be a kid. Is there a famine? Cows eat grass just fine.

Now everything is identification and passwords and CCTV. I moved to the US after WWII because of London starting with that CCTV nonsense. Now there's social media and employment verification.

I really don't like to kill people and steal their lives; it seems stereotypical and there's usually blood involved (gross). I've been getting by mostly by finding people who have died or gone missing, and miraculously returning as them.

The 21st century is by far my least favorite one to date.

It doesn't help that I have never met another shapeshifter. My shapeshifter daddy ran out for milk and cigarettes the minute he bit me, and that was the last I saw of my kind.

Over the years, I have met people sympathetic to these problems, and put out some feelers to try to find another being like me.

For 500 years there was radio silence.


In February of this year, I heard from Raeford, one of my friends I met while backpacking through Eastern Europe.

"Found a village in Croatia where they tell stories about an "Old One" that used in an abandoned lighthouse in one of the barrier islands.

"Centuries ago, sailors used to draw straws, or you know, some version of that, and the loser would have to take a rowboat with supplies to the lighthouse as a tribute for safe passage.

"The story goes that the rowboat would always show up again empty, no sailor or supplies inside, and the ship would pass safely.

"If no supplies were sent, the ship would end up at some nearby port, looking like it had sailed through a hurricane and without a soul onboard.

"Sounded like a classic port folk tale, but they actually have shipping manifests and Captain's logs in a little museum that have been verified by carbon dating.

"Get this, the shipping logs indicate a period of activity that lasted for about 50 years at a time, followed by almost a century of dormancy. Whenever an abandoned ship would show up, the tales would recirculate and they'd start the practice again.

"The last period ended near the start of World War I - an Ottoman ship went missing and the Italians were blamed for it, but it was never proven. Then nothing, until LAST WEEK."

"A little tour boat went missing while sailing the islands, and just washed up empty this morning.

"This has to be the kind of shit you're looking for, man!"

Well this definitely sounded supernatural, but the missing persons weren't really indicative of a shapeshifter unless the missing people turned up later.

It's possible they took the 50 years to collect identities, and then would go live normally for 100 years.

The centuries-long timespan was also helpful. Even if this wasn't a shapeshifter, they have been around a long time and knew how to stay hidden. Maybe they knew of other creatures?

"Send me the location" I replied.


My next conversation with Raeford was in Zadar, Croatia. He picked me up at the airport, and we sat in the Kornat Restaurant discussing the plan for getting to the island over a plate of Calamari.

"If you offer to row out the supplies to the lighthouse, almost any captain will take you out. People have been avoiding sailing there entirely. Another boat, this one belonged to an old man hobbyist, washed up empty yesterday. It used to be mostly a tourist thing, but people are really buying into the old stories now." He told me "Although I guess you could just turn into a fish and swim out."

That sounded exhausting.

"Keep quiet" I said, glancing around. "There's not just a bridge or something that goes out there now?"

"I guess people aren't racing to settle the old, haunted Island in the middle of the sea"

"Hardly the middle. It's a barrier island." I sighed "people probably just crash in the shallows, this is probably nothing. Again."

I took Raeford's suggestion and, when we got into the town, I went to the docks looking for someone that didn't know how to walk on land. I chose one of my more brusque appearances to instill confidence. I had to bring Raeford along because I don't speak Croatian.

He spoke to an older man with a gray beard and a yellow raincoat that made him look like he was on Deadliest Catch. Yes, I have seen Deadliest Catch. Also yes, it was raining pretty badly.

The two of them spok, and I didn't understand a drop of it. The old man looked me up and down and cackled a few times. I suspect he was asking if I'm crazy.

I also had the sudden realization that something that has spent centuries haunting Croatia, may indeed speak Croatian.

Raeford, bless his heart, was doomed as soon as I realized it.


I could try to transcribe their Croatian "na rahneet chays gottem ey?" I may have heard? It would be painful, especially to Croatians.

I'll just skip ahead to the part where this insane-ass old man decides we're going to leave right away, in a freaking monsoon, and Raeford and I went along with it.

I mean, really, I can transform into a fish if I need to, they're shit out of luck. Who's crazy in this story?

We sailed for an hour or two in the rain. I learned the Captain's name was Borislav, and his crew consisted of 5 skinny guys. I'm _pretty_ sure he was a drug runner. That at least makes me feel better about what happened.

Part of me was horrified to see that the lighthouse in question, when it came into view, was lit. If this thing was centuries old, there was no electricity involved; someone had lit the torch at the top of the tower.

Maybe these tales weren't so fake after all.

Raeford and I got into a little dinghy. For a normal human, he was surprisingly willing to throw his life away. I considered if I would bite him to save his life. Nope.

Raeford took the front and I took the back. He was a pretty skinny guy too, probably used whatever drugs Borislav was peddling, so I was going to be the powerhouse in this rowboat.

Yeah, side note again here, don't go out in a rowboat in a storm. We rowed for a full hour to get probably a mile to the island.

I was not happy to find that the lighthouse was on the edge of a cliff, and we were at the bottom.

The cliff face shone a slick black painted in the light of the tower. A winding path led inland from the beach below to the top of the hill. Speckling the path we're skeletons of trees scratching shadows into the light from the light house.

As we approached, the rain let up, and I could see night had snuck up on us.

"What do you think we'll find" I asked, easing my nerves

"One of the stari" he said, wide eyes glowing in the light of the beacon. I thought the shadows were playing tricks on me, but it looked like he was smiling.

"The what?"

"The old ones. Creatures here for thousands of years. In a way, you are a mladi stari. A young old one."

Ah, maybe he was smiling. Raeford got a bit of a hard-on for the supernatural, which is why I had enlisted him in the first place.

We reached the tower, which was a lot bigger up close. The door, a probably 10 ft oak door, was ajar, as if a visitor was expected and the homeowner was too lazy to get up and let them in.

"Heating bill must be through the roof" I chuckled. Raeford was quiet, but almost reverently so. I felt like I was cracking jokes in church. I stopped.

We opened the door and stepped in. Small torches were lit lining the central staircase. Unlike other lighthouses I have been in (not a ton, but you get around to a few in 500 years), the tower was built with rooms around the central staircase on several landings. Presumably these rooms got smaller and disappeared as the tower narrowed towards the top.

I wasn't looking to explore the dark rooms off the side, so I stuck with the lighted stairwell. Raeford went first.

The tower must have been 10 stories tall of solid stone. How the hell did they build this thing out here? Maybe the light house _was_ the being I was seeking, like a cannibalistic Stonehenge.

It wasn't.

We turned the last round of stairs at the top, and panting, Raeford fell to his knees. I thought he might be having a heart attack. I thought I might have one too.

"My master, I have brought you the being of which I spoke." He said

Well, Raeford was officially unfriended.

"Good work. Your loyalty will be rewarded" A hoarse voice croaked from outside of the stairwell, I couldn't see because Raeford was blocking my way. "Come forth young one"

I assumed that meant me, and came out still pretty optimistic. If this thing wanted me here, maybe it wanted to help?

"Hello, ma'am" I said emerging from the stairwell.

Bathed in the light of the beacon sat a woman, I think, with plaster white skin stretched tight over her almost visible bones. Blue, green, and gray veins etched an intricate spider web across her visible skin. She had no eyebrows, and her oil black hair was pasted back into a helmet. She wore a black strapless dress that fell to the floor around the stone chair she sat upon. She looked simultaneously like a 90 year-old woman held together by Botox, and like she may be no older than 45.

A snaggletooth fangs stuck out of each corner her mouth.

A vampire. Hell no.

"Raeford says you have questions"

"Uh, yeah I was trying to find out more about shapeshifters and staying undetected as an immortal" might as well shoot my shot

She chuckled, but it came out as more of a chitter. Babies va

"The shapeshifters are funny creatures. Usually solitary. I have only met one other personally in all my years. She was a meddlesome one."and wait

"Oh...I guess you can't help me then" I said, looking for an exit.

"Nonsense. You are not a typical shapeshifter. You are seeking... community."

"Not really, just some tips."

"We vampires are nothing without our colony. We understand the value of community. As for staying safe from the world, we hibernate and wait for our time. Civilizations rise and fall, this one is almost ready for the harvest."

"Oh that sounds great. Wouldn't have guessed you were into farming! Not really my thing though so I'll just be-"

"You cannot leave. You will feed me and my children for centuries, and as your reward, we will make you one of us"

Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope.

"Nothing against vampires, except the whole 'you have to eat blood to survive' bit. I'm perfectly happy with my blood-free diet thank you!"

Raeford grabbed me from behind. Idiot.

I closed my eyes and turned into a gorilla, thanks DC Zoo. I threw that backstabbing jerk down the stairs with a satisfying chorus of thuds and yelps. I turned back into the current version of myself.

The mother vampire peeled her lips back into a jagged, toothy grin and screeched an unholy bat sound that reverberated through the tower.

Time to go.

I looked for a way out of the tower. If I could get to the beacon, I could turn into a pigeon or something and drop down the cliff to the boat below.

There was a steel door behind mama vamp, but I was _not_ going that way. 

Back down the stairs was the move.

I got down two flights of stairs, passing Raeford's mangled heap on the floor and giving him a swift kick in the backside for good measure. I should've turned into Ronaldo before I kicked him for good measure, but I was in a hurry.

A not so great hissing sound was coming up from the stairs below me, and the stairwell was growing dimmer as torches were extinguished.

For good measure, I turned into a rat and ducked into a room on the landing.

If this were a Pixar movie, the room would've been a kitchen, and I would've whipped up an amazing dish of Steak Tartare, won over the vampires, and opened a Michelin star restaurant.

This wasn't a Pixar movie, so I found myself in a bathroom, minus modern plumbing conveniences, but plus a small window above the latrine bucket. Score.

It may be worth noting that this was more of a "hole" than a "window" since there was no glass. Probably a primitive version of that fan you put on in the bathroom when you know you're going to take a loud, stinky dump.

I scampered up the wall as the shuffling footsteps of presumably vampire spawn came up the stairwell outside.

I hesitated a moment and heard another hiss and screech.

There was a rippling movement on the ceiling above me. I looked up in horror to see upwards of 20 bats roosting on the ceiling and ruffling their wings.

I don't know if vampires can actually turn into bats, but even normal bats carry diseases I don't want to catch and eat rodents.

One of them screeched as I dropped out the window.

Halfway down the tower, I turned into a pigeon and caught the wind in my wings to pull up. All those times falling into the ground were paying off.

I considered trying to turn into a bat, but I had never done that before and figured the wings may handle differently.

Get to the boat. Paddle away. Go home. Stop looking for supernatural stuff. That was the plan.

Step 1 was going okay, except some bats were following me out of the tower now. I was doing a lot more plunging than flapping at least. One almost caught me in a swoop, so I opted for a controlled crash landing.

I plummeted down the cliff, puffed out my wings to slow my fall a bit, and then changed into a cockroach. Gross but those little buggers are nearly indestructible. I only wound up a little bruised from the collision.

I was on the beach at the cliff base, and looked back towards the tower.

In the shadows of the rocks, I could see figures moving on the cliff face. One of them jumped down.

I ran for the boat. Rhythmic, grainy thumps behind me as the figures hit the sand of the beach.

I grabbed the boat and pushed it in the water, as I was about to get in, something grabbed my hand from inside the boat.

I snapped. I ripped my hand away and grabbed an oar. I stabbed the narrow end of the oar into the chest of the vampire dumb enough to wait in my boat for me. The oar tip was rounded so it didn't do much (so much for my wooden stake idea), but knocked the wind out of him. I turned the oar and smacked him in the head with the paddle. He hissed and stumbled back. I tipped the boat and tossed him in the water.

I got in an paddled like hell. I didn't stop until I was a half mile off shore. I should've cried or something, but I just cracked up laughing hysterically. What the hell had just happened?

I could actually see Borislav's boat up ahead, I guess they waited for us, and continued paddling with a little less haste. I had no idea what I was going to say about Raeford. I hadn't learned Croatian in the past few hours.

The world got darker.

The beacon on the lighthouse had gone out. Were the vampires tailing me somehow and wanted to keep cover. Maybe I would speed up a bit.

Borislav's boat was just a shadow on a starry sea now. It started bobbing.

Long shadows rose up around the boat like towers.I heard the distinct sounds of men screaming, gunshots, whips cracking against a fiberglass hull, and then silence.

I stopped rowing, unsure of what to do.

What if I got back to the boat and it was somehow vampire infested? What if whatever got the boat came after me now?

I turned into a shrimp and jumped into the water. I figured whatever was out here, smaller was better. Unfortunately, shrimp swim backwards, it had taken me a few YouTube videos to figure it out, so I couldn't see what I was heading towards.

Whatever had attacked the other boat was attacking my rowboat now. Good thing I had moved.

My new plan was to reach the bigger boat, sneak on board, wait until morning, try to leave without attracting attention.

I did reach the boat, so that was good.

I turned into a rat again and climbed on board, looking for any hidden vampires. None were found.

I took a nap until morning. Plan is going great so far.

I turned back into a human and fired up the motor on the boat. Even the best laid plans have drawbacks.

I made it maybe a quarter mile before I saw a bulge in the water on a converging path with me. Great. I tried to turn, it adjusted. Even better. I turned right at it to ram it.

I rammed it all right, and almost ended up capsized. The boat raised out of the water like a stunt car driver skiing, then jarred back into the water and almost tossed me overboard. The engine sputtered out.

A giant freaking tentacle came out of the water behind me and smacked the boat. I laid flat on the ground and it fortunately missed me.

It came back again and this time wrapped the boat, lifting it from the water. I looked down over the side of the boat and saw a giant maw opening, the sea becoming a waterfall into a gaping mouth.

Human me was screwed, so I was going to have to do one of my least favorite things, improvise.

I turned into a pigeon and flew away from the mouth. Then, I gave a try to becoming a kraken.

Immediately, I don't like being a kraken. I had six giant tentacles, but all of them were kind of doing their own thing. I really had to focus to tell one tentacle to do something, and then the other 5 would just do whatever.

I took my one tentacle I could control and wrapped the kraken. My other tentacles got the idea and went mano a mano (or whatever, you get the point) with the other Kraken's tentacles.

I was trying to give it enough of a fight that it would leave me alone, when I think I made a big mistake.

I bit the kraken. I even ripped off its tentacle. It shrieked and pulled away from me, and swam off. The blood was disgusting, but it was a matter of survival. I tried not to think about it.

I got back to the boat, which had capsized, used my giant tentacle to put it back upright, and drove it into shore.

I flew home and have been thinking about this for a while. I bit that kraken. Is it a shapeshifter now? What if it comes looking for me?

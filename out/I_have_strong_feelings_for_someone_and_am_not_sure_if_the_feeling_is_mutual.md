I (14m) am a closeted gay boy. I just started my first week of high school and over the summer I started to have feelings for a man. Before I knew I was gay, I would have crushes on girls often even tho I felt no desire or attraction towards them. But I’ve NEVER had a crush this big. 
  
The person I have a crush on (also 14m) says that he’s straight. He comes off as very fruity however. It’s seems like he’s at least bi. His best friends are a lesbian and a non binary person that is very passionate about pride. 

Me and him only have gym together. He has lots of his friends in there. Specifically the sports kids. In gym we have a shortage on lockers, so we have to share lockers. Multiple people asked him to share lockers. He ignored all of them and approached me and asked if we could share lockers. This confused me because me and him aren’t that close. Our friendship grew stronger over the summer because me and him went to a concert. This boy isn’t privileged per say. He is very grateful when he gets an opportunity to do something fun. When we went to the concert, he was very very grateful. I paid for his ticket so he could go with us. 

I feel like he suspects that I’m gay because at the concert I said something to my best friend who is the only person that knows I’m gay. We went to see Shawn Mendes and I leaned over to her to comment on how attractive he is. The boy I like heard me and gave me a confused look. I told him I was just joking. I’m not sure he believed me. 

When he asked to shared lockers, I thought that maybe he was just throwing me a bone because my best friend may have made it seem that I like him. Before school started, I asked my friend to talk to him for me. She texted him and said that me and him should hangout more because we have “bestie energy”. It’s didn’t seem to suspicious in mine our her eyes. But he responded in a large paragraph stating that he was straight and that he supports me and that he wishes me good luck. 
 
This was odd given that he had no reason to think I was gay. It seemed sudden and out of nowhere. It made me wonder why he was being so protective of his image. He said that he was straight like 5 times in the message. It made me wonder if he was on to me and really didn’t like me, or if he’s closeted and didn’t want to seem suspicious. Why would he ask ME to share lockers if he’s straight and thought I have a crush on him. Why would he decline the other people that asked him to share lockers. 

He dosent really talk to me during lunch. He just hangs out with his other friends for a little bit and than he goes and walks in the halls alone. I try to get on his good side as much as possible so That he would want to talk to me more. Or so I could clue him in on my true feelings for him. I’ll do things like give him my soda. Before summer, I had a small attraction to him. Everyday I would bring a pack of sushi to school. Not like fancy sushi. Just grocery store sushi. And I would give him pieces of it because he would ask for some all the time. I would never say no. This makes me wonder if he wants to get closer to me. But he dosent ever talk to me much outside of gym class even tho his best friends are In there. I don’t know how he feels about me or if he knows how I feel about him, but it seems like he knows a little bit of how I feel. I don’t know what to do so I’m hoping I could get a little bit of advice. Plz help me figure out how to talk to him and maybe get closer.

For part 4, here is the link  [https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/w2bh0i/helena\_the\_clown\_part\_4/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/w2bh0i/helena_the_clown_part_4/)

As I said in the comments today, I am afraid. I am afraid of Helena, but not mostly of her. But of the implications of what I found. The ”Helena phenomenon” that happened between World War I and World War II seems hard to believe now to me. Especially the coverup that seems to have come from the government. Somebody protected Helena and the Puppeteer, allowed Helena to get away with some violent murders, some were even massacres. And, believe me, Romanians do not have this in them, usually, we do not have too many serial killers, mass murderers and such. Of course, this sounds good, but this makes it even more weird. I do not know how much of what it was in the 1920ties and 1930ties that had great success in making people forget what is still present today, but I know someone may just silence me if I continue. Maybe I am getting paranoid now; I hope not.

I promise I shall try to complain less and keep it up. There are moments when I think to myself: ”What am I doing? Would it be better to back off and get on with my life? Get a new boyfriend, perhaps a future husband, settle and so on?” Yeah, it sounds intuitive. But I *feel* that I need to get on with this. Something in my heart tells me that. Ok, ok, I am done with wailing, and get into action. Here we go...

The diary of Laie the Butcher is fabulous. Without it, most of it would not make sense, even with all the information given by Martha. World War II, famine and all the dictatorships that came after Helena and the Puppeteer probably contributed a lot (I realized this early in the day, already shared this in a comment.) in making people forget all the phenomenon. World War I was also very bad for Romania, most of the country was occupied, the war was devastating. Nothing can be seen in the newspapers.

Laie started making sausages and other meat treats for Gordon James aka the Puppeteer. Laie had acces to some rare spices on his work, he had been in Turkey (The Ottoman Empire) for a few months, and there he learned a lot of things about creating meat delights. It is not very clear how, I do not have the whole diary, Jameson started asking Laie to get him some illegal things or some rare things illegally. He gave Laie some alcohol and discovered that he was ”handy” on stuff like that. There were rare plants, some drugs, rare minerals, some weird chemical products. Laie, at first did not knew what Jameson was doing, his house in Obor area had several rooms, one or two Laie had not access to. He noticed some unknown symbols and decorations on his walls.He had a huge library. Sometimes, a strange feeling came over Laie, a strange fright, especially when Jameson was in that room, or in the basement. He felt some strange smells. Sometimes a strange sort of mist seemed to be present inside the house. Not a strong mist, but something really hard to explain. Months passed by, It seems Jameson pushed Laie slowly into things more and more illegal.

&#x200B;

At some point he asked Laie to start to ”acquire” for him animals, like lambs, piglets, cats, dogs. Laie grabbed stray animals, but also pets. No one of them ended up alive. There was one incident when, after delivering some stuff, Laie so something he could not believe his eyes, meaning a dog he brought a few ago was reduced to a skeleton, but that skeleton was walking in the yard, in chaotic way and emitted some sounds that were unlike he ever before. Jameson came out of the house, put the hand on the skull of the dog, made same gestures and the bones collapsed, lifeless to the ground. ”Another failure.” he said. ”This one is going to trash as well.” he continued to Laie, who was a little scared of all this. He took him inside his house then, pulled some whiskey out and offered a drink to Laie. Keep in mind that, in that time, whiskey was something incredibly hard to get in Romania, although spirits that were similar to whiskey, like raki, tzuika and palinka. This was a moment when their relationship got to a next level.

”Well, Laie, I have watched you for a long time so far. You are smart, capable. Too bad you were born in the wrong place and time. Yes, you told me this yourself, but now I realize it myself. You see, myself, I am a very rare kind of person. Few people like me exist in the entire world. I am part of this small class of people who are very gifted, visionary. Most people, even those who are part of my connections I am sure you know about at least a little, although I assure you that you do not know mostly nothing., most people do not see things like I see them. Yes, most of them are far more opened minded and experienced then common people, but not like me. I am initiated into circles of people who know a lot, but, if it makes sense to you, they do not know as much as they can. You know why? They are satisfied with what they have. They are full of themselves.

&#x200B;

You see, some call me a witch, a wizard. A magician. They are correct, more or less. But I am not just that. You see, I am a scientist as well. And the science, how I see it, and magic, work not just hand in hand, but they work as one, as a whole. Science takes now a wrong path, that will lead, I am sure, to progress, but will also close some perspectives on reality, on life. As of myself, I am willing to keep it alive and well, and real, as much as I would be able to. And you, lad, could help me. You see, my name will remain in history, even if the masses shall forget it. And yours as well, if you accept to work for me at new level.”

&#x200B;

At this point, Laie was also confused, but somewhat excited. He seems to have felt that what was coming, what he will be asked will bring him on a point of no return. He was right. Jameson proposed to abduct a certain man who will not make it out alive. Laie was kinda of fearful, but Jameson told him in  calm tone that is little to no reason to worry. His connections are high, although this does not mean he would be completely safe. But that he will, eventually, be free of his former weaknesses and drawbacks if the managed to succeed in his tasks. Laie had a flicker of conscience, he asked Jameson to let him thing about it for one night. He was allowed to sleep in the house of Jameson and think about it. He accepted. During the night, he so a dark shape, almost shapeless in the window and was scared. It looked like almost no head, arms, torso, were distinguishable . He wanted to get out, but Jameson entered the room, turned on the light and calmly told Laie that he just so one of his friends who helps him in his work, that this is an experience only a few have, that he needs to get calmer and become accustomed with things like this, if he wants to share a great destiny with him. Then he asked to get and abduct that man. Laie decided to execute and that, I guess, the moment that sealed his fate.

&#x200B;

Once the victim was unconscious in the yard, Jameson invited Laie in the basement. In there it seemed to be some sort of medical room, with a table on it, many jars and tanks. The table seemed to look very much with an autopsy or embalming room. There were weird symbols and decorations in there. The man was tied up naked to the table. Jameson started performing some rituals on me, I shall not give some details on them, being afraid someone my use them and, then, who knows what consequences might be, and I shall be responsible. What I can tell you is that he drained the man of his blood alive, then cut him open, like in an autopsy, but he was still alive, while performing the rituals. He removed some of his internal organs, like his liver, while the man was not just alive, but conscious. In the end, he removed his heart and then the dark mist came into the basement. Laie freaked out and fainted. He woke up seeing the victim walking, mindlessly, dead. He was scared, Jameson put a hand on the head of the dead man and the victim fell, lifeless, to the ground.

Laie was shaken, but Jameson, calmly, told him to make some kebab from the flesh of the corpse. He said that he needs to open his mind., that the human flesh looks very much the flesh of the animals he sacrifices for meat,  it also taste the same. That it makes very much sense to actually eat ”human meat”. ”I am proud of you, Laie my lad. You made so far. One more step, I know you can do it”. Jameson said. Laid, somewhat shaken, executed. The kebab was delicious, he wrote in the diary.

&#x200B;

This marks the beginning of a serious of magical experiments Jameson conducted, most of them gruesome, I shall spare you of useless details, also spare myself of them. They went on and on. Jameson wanted to achieve something, he did not told Laie what, perhaps Laie would not be able to understand what his master was up to. He was the henchman of sorcerer mad scientist. There was no way back.

&#x200B;

There are also some more lighted passages of the diary, like when hr visited his cousin, at work. Alexandra, the daughter of the colonel, was kinda of a lonely kid, not sure if due to her illness, personality, or family, or some combination. She was working hard of the education she got, she was going to become a real lady at some point. On her spare time, she stayed very much with Helena, and share with her what she got, her new knowledge and skills, and Helena accepted them. The mother of Helena tried her best at home to keep Helena as much as possible of the ”Gipsy stuff” of her relatives already, not to steal, not to be vulgar, to be decent person, even if she was lower class. The poor daughter of the servants seemed to have started enjoying all of it, and the parents of Alexandra tolerated all this, it seems due to the fact that Alexandra had little to no friends. Helena was not allowed to spend the night at their home, at first but, in time, she was allowed to sleep in a spare bedroom. Sometimes she ended up sharing the bed with Alexandra. They did not had brothers or sisters, they ended up calling themselves ”sisters”. Helena would seem to become a lady herself, in time, if that time allowed it to. The ”Gipsyness” in her was getting weaker by the day.

&#x200B;

Who knows what would have been of them, if they fate would have been different? Perhaps Helena would have become a professional ballerina, she seemed to have real talent on it.  Unfortunately, things went really tragic. And that bastard Laie recorded it in detail.... I think the two were beautiful together. One of them middle to upper class, blue-eyed blonde, with pale skin, the other lower-class, black hair, black eyes and olive skin, but they loved each other. And Alexandra would have been the one who liberated Helena from her social condition. Laie despised both of them now, perhaps, as his heart went darker and darker, he hated the light in the soul of a child. They even prayed together, went to church together. Perhaps the colonel would have adopted Helena? No, unlikely to have happened. I have cried tonight thinking of the two sisters in heart. Oh, I wished I so them, how they were. I wish I so them with my own eyes. The gentleness and noble heart of Alexandra worked wonders.

&#x200B;

Next time, I shall try to conclude all this tragic story. It would be a tough one, but bare with me. For now, take care of yourselves and your loved one. Good Night... Ruxandra is out.

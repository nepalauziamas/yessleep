Reasons I hate our new house:

&#x200B;

1. Jason’s room is bigger than mine and not just by a little.
2. The tyre swing is broken.
3. Our neighbours brought us fruit cake. Gross.
4. My toys don’t fit on the shelves so I have to choose some to sleep in bed with me every night and some of them might feel left out.
5. No matter how far we drive, we can never leave town.

I sit in the back of the car reading my book. Jason is on his phone, smiling to himself.

He has a secret girlfriend that he thinks that Mum and Dad don’t know about.

They do.

My book explains that we all have our own fairy to keep us safe. The fairy is too quick and small to see, but the book says that if you close your eyes then open them really fast, you can see the fairy flutter away.

I try it over and over until my head feels funny. Finally, I see my fairy. I tell Mum, Dad and Jason proudly.

Jason tells me I’m just seeing my eyelashes. Dad tells Jason to stop it. I call Jason a bad word. Dad tells me to stop it. I slam my book closed and look out of the window instead.

Mum suggests we stop to get some lunch. Dad says we don’t have time to stop.

Everyone is angry and it’s all because we’re moving to the stupid new house.

We were happy at our old house. Maybe not the kind of happy that you see on TV where everyone smiles all the time even when they’re just eating dinner. But we were our own sort of happy.

\*

When we pull up to the new house, I can’t help but notice how much bigger it looks than our old house. I can see Mum looking at my face to see if I like it. I keep frowning so she doesn’t think I’m happy about this. Mum sighs and tells me and Jason to go and pick our rooms.

Being the youngest kid is the worst thing in the world. You can get anything you want when you’re the oldest. Jason of course picks his room and his room is so much bigger than mine. Mine is upstairs where the attic should be.

I complain to Mum and Dad but they do that thing that grown-ups do where they act excited to try to convince you something is good. Like when they say, “Yay! Delicious broccoli” or “Yay! Fun homework!” or in this case “Yay an attic room!” as if they think kids are stupid.

Mum and Dad tell Jason to help me unpack my stuff. When nobody is listening, Jason tells me that my room will probably have loads of spiders because it’s an attic room.

I call him another bad word.

Dad hears me and now I’ve lost my pocket money for the whole week.

I hate Jason.

The attic room is much bigger than my old room but there’s hardly any shelves. My old bedroom had shelves all over the walls and all of my toys fit perfectly on them. Now, only about half of them fit.

I wonder whether I could ask Dad to build some more shelves, but that probably won’t go well. I was supposed to get rid of some of my toys before we moved so that my new bedroom won’t be as cluttered. I don’t think my old bedroom was cluttered. I think it was perfect. Besides, I could never abandon my toys like that.

No. The toys that don’t fit on my shelves will need to go on my bed. It won’t leave much room for me to sleep but that’s okay. I just need to make sure that the shelf-toys don’t feel left out. Maybe I could make some kind of rota.

\*

I decide that I’ll have a break from sorting out my room and go to check out the garden. For the first time, I smile. There’s a tyre swing in the back garden and it looks like so much fun. I run over to try it out but Dad shouts over telling me to stop. He tells me that it’s not safe for playing on and that they’ll be getting rid of it soon.

I argue back that it looks safe, but Dad tells me “end of conversation”. Grown-ups always say “end of conversation” when they don’t want to admit they’re wrong.

I’m so angry that I kick the wooden frame of the tyre swing. The whole thing creaks and bends.

I look back, hoping Dad didn’t see but he did. He raises his eyebrows at me as if to say, “See. I told you so.”

The garden is much bigger than our old garden but there isn’t much in it yet.

I know that Mum and Dad are planning on putting loads of chairs out here for parties, but the garden is so big that we could probably also fit a swing set, a slide and a trampoline out here. I think I will ask them when they’re in a better mood.

I think about going into the shed but it’s probably full of spiders. Instead, I run my hand along the garden fence. It’s much taller than me, so I can’t see over, but I do find a small hole. I stand on my tiptoes and look through.

There’s a boy sat in his garden who looks a little bit smaller than me. He’s holding something in his hands and he’s licking it like a lollipop. As I watch him, the thing in his hand moves, as if it’s alive and I scream out loud before I can stop myself.

The boy moves faster than I’ve ever seen anyone move, and before I can step back, we’re eye-to-eye.

“Sorry,” I shout through the fence.

The boy says nothing. He just stands there. I move back, but I can still see his big white eye through the hole. It follows me as I move.

I decide not to tell Mum and Dad else they’ll tell me off for peeping. Instead, I head back inside to take another look at Jason’s room.

He now has pictures of women on his walls and the women aren’t wearing many clothes. I tell him that private parts are meant to be private.

He calls me a bad word, but Dad doesn’t hear so Jason doesn’t lose any pocket money.

\*

We’re in the middle of dinner when there’s a knock at the door. It’s a pretty lady and the boy who I saw in next door’s garden. The lady tells Mum and Dad that they live next door and that they’ve come to welcome us.

They bring a fruitcake. Everyone knows that fruitcake is the worst kind of cake. Mum always says that you can’t trust someone who puts fruit in their cake. She doesn’t say that now though. She just smiles and thanks them. They talk about boring grown-up things for a while and then the lady asks if it’s okay for Jason and I to leave the room so that she can speak with Mum and Dad privately.

Mum and Dad look shocked about this. Mum and Dad always look shocked for the silliest of reasons. They say manners are very important, and that there are some things that you’re not supposed to do at someone else’s house.

For example, when you're visiting someone else's house, you’re not supposed to ask them to change the TV channel or ask for something different for dinner or, as I found out recently, tell them that their baby looks like a goblin.

I guess asking kids to leave the room is also one of those things you don’t do at other people’s houses. Whatever. Grown ups have strange rules.

Anyway, I’m secretly a little happy because their conversation is boring and this way I don’t have to smile and pretend to be listening.

Jason and I go into the living room. Jason tries to listen at the door but I can tell from the way his eyebrows are moving that he can’t hear anything.

Their talk goes on for ages and ages and we can’t hear anything. I ask Jason to set the TV up for us. He tells me to shush. I try to set the TV up myself but I can’t reach the plug.

Then all of a sudden, there’s no need for Jason to listen at the door because it’s so loud. Dad is shouting that something is completely absurd. Mum is telling the lady that it’s time for her to leave. The lady is shouting that she is trying to help us out. Dad shouts that she must be barking mad.

I know the lady must have said something really bad because I’ve never heard Dad talk to anyone like that before. Not even parking attendants.

\*

The lady leaves and nobody speaks for the rest of dinner. I help myself to three helpings of dessert. Nobody stops me. Mum even pushes the plate closer to me. I decide to push my luck and lick the bowl. Nobody seems to notice or mind, except Jason, who calls me a pig.

Mum and Dad go off into the other room and whisper. When they come back, they tell us that we are going for a drive to the beach. They say we live quite close to the coast, so it would be fun to check it out.

We don’t usually go out on trips this late, so the beach must be really cool.

We all pile in the car (“No, Anita. You’re not bringing a snorkel!”) and start driving. I try to read the rest of my book but after what Jason said about eyelashes, I don’t like the book as much anymore.

Mum and Dad said the beach wasn’t far away, but they drive for ages and ages. So long in fact that my eyes start to close and even the sounds of them arguing can’t keep me awake properly.

“I took the left like you said!”

“Well then the map’s wrong!”

“Of course the map isn’t wrong. Let me pull over.”

As usual, when this happens, Dad gives the map to Jason so that he can navigate instead of Mum. I hear Jason give directions for a while and suddenly there’s shouting again.

“It makes no sense. We just passed that!”

I open my eyes again and look out of the window.  This street looks a lot like the one right next to our new house! It is! There’s the park with the little playground. Mum pointed it out on the way here to try to make me like this place. But then we noticed that the playground just has baby swings and baby slides. Babies don’t even like playgrounds. Their mums just bring them to take photos of them.

Stupid babies. Stupid playground.

I ask what's going on.

Jason tells me I snore like a pig.

I tell Jason he looks like a pig.

Dad tells us both to be quiet.

It’s then that I realise that Mum and Dad don’t just sound angry like usual. They sound kind of scared. And after a while, Jason sounds a bit scared too. In fact, I start thinking I should maybe be scared but I can’t figure out what’s happening.

We drove for such a long time. How have we ended up back here? Did they all go to the beach while I was asleep? Or did we really just drive in a big circle? Mum isn’t usually that bad at navigating. I make myself listen more carefully now.

“Look. We drove across the bridge here and then suddenly it’s like we were back here again,” says Dad, poking the map angrily with his finger.

“Maybe the map actually is wrong.”

“Look, why don’t we just ask for directions?”

“I’m checking the map on my phone. It says the same thing. It’s weird.”

“What about if we take the tunnel?”

“I was going to try that when we turned off back there. But we ended up back over here before we reached it.”

“Ask this man! Quick!”

“Alright, fine. Excuse me?”

The man is dressed in a raincoat and hat, even though it’s been warm for over a week now. His skin is like old people’s skin that’s gone dry and dusty but his face looks like a young man.

Mum and Dad laugh and tell the man that Mum is terrible at reading a map.

He doesn’t laugh.

They explain that they’re new to the area and they’re trying to find the beach.

He says nothing.

They show him the map and the place they are trying to get to, and they laugh again as they tell the man they seem to be going around in circles.

The man doesn’t smile once.

He points at the beach on the map and says, “That’s not in town.”

“Yes, yes that’s right. We’re actually looking to head out of town and drive over to \[redacted\] beach.”

“You’ll find that this town has everything you need,” the man says and then he walks off, leaving everyone confused.

Jason laughs at the weird man and I laugh a bit too. But Mum and Dad don’t laugh at all. I can see their faces in the car mirror and they look really frightened now. I feel frightened too as we drive back to the house.

\*

When we get back to the house, Dad goes out into the garden. I ask to go with him but Mum tells me to go to bed.

I don’t go to bed. Jason and I go to his room and watch Dad out of the window. He’s filling in the hole in the fence.

When I go to sleep, I feel frightened but not because there might be spiders in the attic room. I’m frightened because when I close my eyes, I see the big white eye of the boy next door and I dream that he’s watching [me.](https://www.reddit.com/r/viciousmock/comments/i5robb/list_of_stories/)

The branches of hell are endless- so many bodies, so many souls, so many rooms. The sheer scope of it all should be daunting, and yet I know exactly where to go. There was no way I could have seen this deeply in just by sacrificing Benson, but I don’t question my good fortune- I just follow my feet and try not to think too hard about the prickling hairs on the back of my neck.

The demon is strangely silent within me. Normally, we interact more, especially when we feed. Was Mark’s demise not exciting enough?

Regardless of how, my feet find my way to another one of those horrid rooms. I can feel it more than hear it, almost like a siren’s song emanating from the fleshy walls. The sphincter pulsates as I near it. I look through the walls, and there is no shape inside, only the lax tentacles now starting to twitch and writhe.

Still, there’s an odd sort of calmness washing over me as I approach, one at conflict with the squirming in my gut, and a sudden itch on the backs of my hands. It’s alright; things will be just fine if I go in there. In fact, I am better off in there than out here, wandering lost in Hell. It begins to open, some sweet smelling pus leaking out. I can see the tendrils lurking just beyond the entryway.

No. I plant my feet, force myself to stop. No, no. Whatever that is- it’s my hell. Just like with Mark’s, if I concentrate, I can catch glimpses of it breaking through the rising fog in my brain- the angry face of my father, him lashing out with words and fists…. Worse, behind him on the basement floor…. 

*What is that shape?*

No. I turn and start walking again. I can hear it open, the tendrils snaking after me- what was a siren’s song morphs into something darker, dreadful- lovely angelic voices growing deep, warm organ music bleeding into heavy, deep foreboding graveyard church bells.

They lash out, but I manage to stay clear, staggering further into Hell, but away from them. I’m itching all over now. In particular, there’s a thought scratching at the back of my mind that maybe, just maybe that wasn’t \*really\* my hell- that it was just a trap to goad me further and further into the bowels of hell. Why else would I have escaped so easily? What is this warm sensation carrying me forward?

Warm? Yes. So warm. Almost like the joy of receiving my mother’s praise, or the few precious times when shit went right in my life… no, warmer even than those.

Hot, even.

I’m not staggering down the hall anymore; I’m marching. I know exactly where I am going and the doors can’t call to me anymore. I catch glimpses, whiffs, little snippets of each horrible shitshow that I pass, but they can’t stop me. I sneer as I walk by.

Their fates are awful, but not my problem. My business lies further in.

Unlike the other translucent little nightmare pods, this one is crimson; perhaps it’s filled to the brim with blood. Serves him right, really. There in the center, a shadowy shape, human enough, but in my mind, more demonic than the one in me.

“Hi dad,” I say.

He can’t see me, nor can he hear me- and I can’t see into his hell from here. Still, by the way he twists and groans, it obviously hurts, and that brings me just the slightest touch of satisfaction.

“You’re a real piece of shit, you know?” I start to pace back and forth. The sphincter quivers a bit every time I draw close to it.

“Was it really so hard to love me? What the fuck did I do to deserve this treatment?”

The tendrils are slackening just a bit, I realize. His body is drifting toward the floor of the chamber, low enough that his toes are resting in the bile at the bottom.

“You gave Mark the best of everything, no matter how shitty he was, no matter how much he let you down. I tried to be the perfect son and you didn’t even give a shit!”

The tendrils binding his neck and face loosen. I can see his eyes- blank, vacant. The tendril slips out of his mouth, and I hear a quiet gasp.

“You gave everything to him- and you were going to fucking sacrifice me for what? So Mark could have an even better life?!” I clench my fists, making my way back toward the opening. It widens as I approach.

“And what about Mom? Even if you thought I was a fuck up, what the hell did she do to deserve this?”

It opens. I step into the chamber, into a gross pit of slime and bile, sweat and tears. My father is half crumpled on the floor, his knees in the filth. Only the cords binding his arms keep him from completely collapsing. 

As I get closer, I see it.

Dad’s hell.

Suddenly, we’re not in some foul, slimy pit. 

But the living room. 

*What?*

More shocking than the sudden transition, I see me. No, not me. Mes. Tens? Hundreds? All huddled around the edges of the room, versions of me at every age, begging for Dad’s attention. And in the center, I can see dad cringing, grimacing, howling in pain. And why?

There are no knives. No fire, except for the cheerily burning fireplace. No pins and needles, no poison. Just my father, staring at the table. And on the table?

A window.

A window into Mark’s hell. His suffering. Standing over it, eyes filled with tears. I can catch the sense of sorrow, the agony he feels watching his poor boy suffer, all while he ignores the son around him.

My blood boils, but when I open my mouth, a bitter laugh escapes.

“This is your worst nightmare, huh?” I ask, sauntering between the rows of me. I clap my hand on my dad’s shoulder. 

He wakes with a jolt. “Peter!” confusion on his face gives way to relief. “Peter! It is you! Thank goodness!”

No.

He clasps my hand, pulls me into a hug. “Thank goodness you’ve come Peter! You’ve got to get me out of here!”

The audacity. I look around at all the mes still pleading. Then back to my father.

“Let’s go Pete!” He shouts desperately. We have to go! We have to save Mark too!”

I smile. “You’re right, dad.” I clasp my hand firmly on his shoulder, squeezing hard enough to make him wince. “This is no place for you.” 

Then, we’re back in the pit. The tendrils fall away from my father, and I help him to his feet. The room pulses weakly, and we make our way out of it, back into the hall.

“I am so glad you found me!” he says.

“Let’s go,” I say. “I know where Mark is.”

“Yes. Let’s hurry!”

The chamber doesn’t try to stop us. We start walking, and I am warm again. I listen for the song I heard- the siren’s call. The empty chamber. It pulls me, and I guide my father.

“Are you sure this is the way?” he asks.

There’s still enough demon in me to tell me that maybe he feels it too- he can navigate hell to some degree. It makes sense. But there’s one thing I know that he doesn’t.

“We’re going exactly where we need to.”

We come back to the chamber. My father goes to the wall and peers inside.

“What? Where is he?”

I’m still listening to the siren song. It’s so powerful, so beautiful this close. And I am warm.

So warm.

SO VERY FUCKING WARM.

“Pete? I don’t see him in there!” dad turns to look at me as I’m drawing closer to the entrance. The sphincter opens slowly, so welcoming.

“PETE! Where is he?!”

Dad runs to me, panic on his face. 

I’ve never been warmer. I am so hot with this hatred it scorches my bones. I would be ash if it weren’t for the spite buried even deeper within me.

I grab father by the throat and I hoist him from the ground.

“You vile fucking bastard. You sicken me to my core. Everything about you.”

“Pete, what are you saying? I’ve always loved—”

&#x200B;

I tear out his eye with my free hand.

&#x200B;

“AAAAAAAAGGGGH!!!!!” He clasps a hand over his bleeding socket, staring at me with his good eye. ”What the FUCK, Pete?”

“You fucking liar.” I start stalking toward the entryway.

See, I know what my hell is. I’ve known it ever since I made the deal with the demon. I’ve meditated on it every second, even when I was torturing Mark, slaughtering his family, fucking Benson’s wife, all of it.

My life was hell enough, and I saw it through the gate.

“No, Pete!” Dad is catching on, struggling helplessly against me. He’s a weak, frail old man, growing weaker every second. “Don’t do it! We can escape, all of us!” Dad glances over his shoulder at the gaping entryway, the tendrils snaking toward us. “All of us?” I ask, feigning wonder, like I’m actually considering it. “Even Mom?!”

As we get closer, I’m shrinking. De-aging, really. Adult me… teenage me…. Child me.

I’m still stronger than dad. He can’t break free as I drag him into the chamber.

He realizes there’s nothing he can do to change my mind. “You ingrate! You brat! I’ve done everything for you, and this is how you repay me?!”

I pause forming an image of myself in my mind, right as I am now.

*This little boy, in need of acceptance and validation in the wake of his mother’s passing.*

*A vulnerable child.*

“Yeah,” I say quietly.

The tentacles are almost on me. I pull dad in front of me, like a shield.

“There’s not a hell in this world or any other that is bad enough for what you’ve done,” I utter. “Even this nightmare is better than what you deserve.”

I push that vision of myself onto my father; now he is the little boy, vulnerable, afraid, lonely. He sees it, he feels it- 

And so does the room.

The tentacles pounce on him, serpents constricting his arms, legs, and throat. I watch as long as I dare before backing out of the chamber.

Forever? Eternity? However long, my father is going to spend time trapped in my body, weathering his own endless abuse in the wake of the passing of the only person who ever loved him. He’s going to suffer as I did, buried under the weight of his own greed, hubris, cruelty.

Maybe in a few decades, he will feel what I did. And once he does, it will continue.

It’s not my problem anymore.

I exit the tunnel. No longer warm. The air is cold and sickly. The demon is all but gone, slipping through my fingers, black sand from a broken hourglass.

I could escape, you know. Go back to my life. I thought about it. Live the rest of it, finally free and clear.

But no. This is hell. I’m here for a reason. I retrace my steps.

Back to my father’s Hell, now empty. Someone needs to fill it, and who knows where I’ll go if I don’t.

I step inside, and the tentacles willingly and readily envelop me.

See, being surrounded by the me needing support and validation….

Watching my brother suffer endlessly for all eternity….

Is that really hell for someone like me?

I was still a medical student doing a residency in Papua New Guinea when I first saw this new, unknown organ with my own eyes. I saw it on the scans, attached like a leech to my newborn son’s heart. At the time, I had no idea that these scans were the very first images anyone in the world had seen of it, and that we had in fact been the ones who had unknowingly discovered it. I also had no idea that it was the start of an event that would overshadow everything else we had so far in our human history. 

The hospital was a small community of close-knit doctors and nurses, so when news of my son’s predicament spread, there was a call to action from every individual that worked there. There was no delay in getting the scans done when the nurses noticed some abnormalities in my son’s bloodwork. When the doctors first showed the images to me, I noticed that the mysterious object was the brightest and whitest thing I had ever seen on a scan of a human body. I had never seen an organ in the human body that looked like that under X-ray. This would make sense later when scientists found out that no matter what type of X-ray or radiation, not even a single particle would be able to penetrate this organ. 

Days after discovering this growth in my son, we started finding them in every single newborn. Panic spread internationally when cases of this growth were being found in our neighboring countries of Indonesia and Australia. The organ was only showing up in newborns. The world was on edge, thinking this could be some sort of pandemic that could eventually reach other nations, and one that affected only our sexual reproductive cycle. The world took it seriously the moment news reached their own shores. It started being found deeper within South East Asia, and then spread all the way through to China and Russia. Simultaneously, when the first newborn with this organ was found at the edge of the continent all the way in Portugal, it was found in North and South America. The organ was now in every newborn baby across the globe. It was believed that Papua New Guinea was where it all started from, which is why our remote hospital suddenly became the epicenter of the largest joint cooperation between the nations the world had ever seen. Humankind had finally found something that had forced them to focus collectively on a single goal. This something was the size of a kidney bean.

I decided that I would dedicate every waking moment to learn everything I could about it. It cost me dearly, including my marriage, my health, and eventually my sanity. 

We nicknamed it the ‘nomad organ’, when it was discovered that the organ was not found in the same location within the body. In fact, not a single one was found in the same location as another. It could be found attached to any other organ, in the arms, the legs, around the skull, and in some cases, even in the brain. In my son, it was found attached to the heart. The location was completely random, but there were also similarities that stayed constant throughout all cases. One, the organ was always found within the body and never exposed. Two, it never grew larger than a kidney bean. Each one was the exact same size as all the others, no matter at what age. Another constant that we were hesitant to admit was that it affected their psyche in the same way, but that was something we could not measure.

One horrific discovery came when surgeons removed the organ from one of the newborns. The patient became deceased immediately, without any lead up to it, or any other adverse reaction. It was not the last attempt at trying to remove the organ, and it was attempted throughout the years, even when the babies grew older through to adulthood. Each attempt at removal provided the same result; instant death. It seemed that the moment the final strand of connection was severed between the organ and the body, existence ceased for that patient without any chance of recovery. We never figured out why. If the nomad organ was not directly attached to my son’s heart, I would have also had it removed immediately. I do not feel proud when I say that I was glad it was another one’s life instead of my son’s that led to this discovery.

Even so, scientists still had a number of separated nomad organs that they could study. Some of these came from bodies of those that passed by accident, but some came from brave adult volunteers, who had seen the devastation the organ inside them had caused as they grew from childhood. The bewilderment of this organ grew exponentially after the first one was cut into. There was nothing inside it, yet we knew that was impossible with what the results from the scans were showing us. There had to be something encased within it, but it seemed that whatever was inside disappeared completely the moment it was exposed. Even the slightest prick of a needle or from a laser did the same.

The physical properties of the organ were perplexing, but it was what it did to their minds that was truly disturbing. 

Everyone who had the organ could not lead normal lives, as they were tracked, interviewed, and extensively studied since birth. This meant that we had a trove of accounts and observations spanning over a decade. At the time, we were confident that we could understand what was happening the more we recorded things. The longer time went on, and the larger these records grew, the more baffled we became. What started out as hope turned into an utter sense of despair and disbelief. 

Every single person with the nomad organ had recounted how they would see moving lights in obscure locations, followed by bizarre ripples in the environment. Any type of video or camera failed to capture these phenomena, even when pointed out directly. These sightings were always accompanied by feelings of being watched. When probed about what they meant by that, it became even more distressing. Many said it felt as if they were a prey being stalked by a predator, so it was not simply a feeling of being watched, but of being hunted. A sense of fear and anxiety had always accompanied these incidents, with a visceral feeling that something inside of them, something that our minds and bodies never had to use since the times of our primeval ancestors, was stirred awake and began screaming at them to run. This usually led to them freezing in place, not having any inkling of where they should run or what exactly they should be running from. Many could not live with these constant feelings of fight-or-flight, the feelings of dread too heavy a burden. When stories of alien abductions or supernatural events are recounted to us, we tend not to believe them or attribute them to some other cause such as the effects of drugs or mental illness. When each individual recounted the exact same encounters and experiences, we would be absolutely foolish to dismiss them. My son told me the same things, and I felt an abject failure as a parent for not being able to comfort him, or to face whatever demons he was left to deal with on his own. I still cannot forgive myself to this day. 

The older my son got, the more he was seeing these strange visions, and the more intense the feelings of fear and anxiety became. I could tell immediately when he was having one of these episodes, as the fear etched into his face too visible, too painful to bear. The most I could do was hold him. He began to hear voices, whispering to him, speaking to him in a language that sounded primordial and extinct. One day he told me he had a feeling that he had to go soon. I asked him to where? He said he didn’t know, but that the ones calling out to him would show him the way. I remember watching the news that same day, where they had an interview with a group who had the nomad organ. They all said the same thing as my son. Each of them said they had the feeling of needing to go soon, of being pulled somewhere whether they wanted to or not. Some looked fearful, yet some looked like they had accepted their fate. My son was one of those who accepted it. I remember feeling a profound sense of sadness, that there was no stopping the inevitable. I remember feeling a sense of pure hatred against the world, and anger at how infantile our collective human knowledge was no matter how many millennia we had as a species. I was always a pursuer of knowledge, thinking that anything we came across, no matter how alien or incomprehensible, would eventually be understood with time. I did not think that any longer. The final day of this ordeal finally came, and the conclusion of it was instantaneous, just like how it began. That day, every single individual with the nomad organ disappeared, like their existence had just been wiped off the face of our planet, ripped away from our reality. That was the day humanity finally knew, that it truly knew nothing at all.

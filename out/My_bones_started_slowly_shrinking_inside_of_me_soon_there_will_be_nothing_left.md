 

I hit forty recently and began seeing signs of it, I found myself waking up at least three times a night to go to the toilet, I found hair growing in places it never grew before and I put on a bit of weight. I exercise regularly, I don’t eat carbs, I watch my sugar and fat intake, but I still couldn’t lose the extra pounds. My wife is a health freak and very competitive, she teases me by calling me her chubby little dodo, I don’t think she means any harm, it’s just her way of trying to motivate me, but it hurts. I tried upping my exercise routine and going on all kinds of diets, but nothing seemed to work, so I came across this pill online. Guaranteed results within a week, without exercise or dieting, the commercial said, I didn’t really understand how it worked, but I thought what have I got to lose. They seemed a little bit expensive, but then again, I often wasted more money on a lot less, so I ordered a month's supply, within a week they arrived. 

When I opened the package and looked inside, I saw an image of a skinny guy smiling, while holding a pair of pants that looked 10 sizes too big for him on the box. The writing was in Chinese I think, the only thing that was in English was the word Nano, which I knew was some sort of miniature robot. I was becoming very curious, how could them tiny little bots help you lose weight? I opened the box and tried to find out, but I couldn’t make since of the instructions. It had three steps, the first one showed the image of someone opening a pill and putting something inside, it looked like chicken fat, then a drop of water. The second showed him shaking it, underneath that there was a clock pointing to one, which I assumed meant wait one hour. The third showed a diagram of a person with arrows pointing down their throat then through the digestive system, with smaller arrows pointing outwards around their whole body.  

That’s all I could make out without a translator. I didn’t really have a clue what to do, so I guessed. I know, putting a bit of chicken fat into a capsule and swallowing it seems like a dumb thing to do, but to be honest I've seen people do worse to lose weight. The only chicken I had was the leftover chicken wings my wife had on the countertop, unfortunately she didn’t leave much fat or meat, for that matter, so I broke off a little bit of the bone and put it in the capsule with a drop of water. An hour later I took it. By that stage I didn’t expect much from it, the whole idea was starting to make me feel stupid. I burned the box before my wife got home, if she found out I'd never hear the end of it. She thinks she is a lot smarter than me and often talks down to me when I get things wrong, I'm not a child I keep telling her, which she always replies stop acting like one then. 

It only took about two days before I started seeing results, I had lost a couple of pounds, I was really happy, I finally got something right I thought. As the days went on, I noticed I was losing roughly 1 pound a day which was good, but I thought what if I took two pills, I would lose weight faster. So, I started taking two at a time and it worked. I started losing 2 pounds every day, things were looking up for me, my belt size went down, and I was fitting into my old clothes again. The only downside was I had some skin folds, but I thought it was normal when people lose weight fast, so I ignored it. It wasn’t until the skin on my fingers and hand started to become loose that I realized there was a problem, I tried to hide it from my wife at first by avoiding her. But soon that didn’t matter because all the skin in my whole body became loose. One morning she started rubbing my face in bed, she got freaked out when she felt my face stretch and took me to hospital. I was too embarrassed to tell them what I had taken in front of my wife. So, I waited until she went home to get clothes the next day. By then they had done all kinds of tests on me but couldn't find out why my bones were shrinking, the only good thing was, it was causing no pain. 

As soon as she left, I tried telling them the whole story, which took a while, they said they had never heard of anything like that before. Eventually I told them to look up nanobots, weight loss, China, and they did, they looked shocked when they saw the video and left the room, I guess to do some research. I heard nothing from them until the next day. My wife was with me when they told me what was wrong, the nanobots were there to eat fat one pound per capsule, I had taken at least 15 by then. To activate them, I was supposed to put in a tiny piece of fat which they supplied. I only saw the capsules; I never even checked the box for anything else before burning it. Unfortunately for me I put in a chicken bone, which trained them to feed on bones, the doctors weren’t sure what would happen to me, they said the only reason I was still walking around was because the bone was harder for them to break down than fat. They said there was no way to stop them and there was nothing they could do for me, my wife was heartbroken, she said she felt responsible for teasing me about my weight, but I can’t blame her for my own stupidity. 

Things started to speed up after that, and within a few days, my fingers and toes were all but gone, they flopped around like a pair of old socks when I moved my arms, It made some of the nurse's uncomfortable, they didn’t say anything, but I could see it in their faces. I had my first break one day, when I tried to go to the toilet. I got out of bed and stood up, the bones instantly cracked on my right leg, I fell to the ground shattering my left leg in three places, the weird thing was, it didn’t even hurt. The doctor told me the nanobots must have severed the nerves, I have been bedridden since. The only person that comes to see me is my wife, no one else has the stomach for it. I can barely move these days, if it were not for voice activated technologies, I would have no contact with the outside world. But soon that won’t matter because I won’t be able to talk, I feel the bones on my face becoming weaker every day, eventually I will just be a pile of skin and fat, I'm told.  

I'm only telling my story to warn people about nanobots, while I still can, so they won’t make the same mistakes I did.

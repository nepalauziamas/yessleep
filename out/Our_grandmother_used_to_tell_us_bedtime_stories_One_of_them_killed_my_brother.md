When I was much younger, probably around six or seven, my grandmother became frail and moved into our house so my parents could help care for her. I hadn’t spent much time with her before that due to how far away she had lived but we grew close rapidly. 

Her bedroom had been just across the hall from mine and she would limp into my room each night and tell me a bedtime story. I always knew she was coming when I heard her door slam followed by the *thump* of her old cane. Sometimes they would be the classics everyone heard growing up like “Hansel and Gretel” or “The Three Little Pigs”. 

One day I had gotten into a fight at school. I hate to admit it but for my first two years of elementary school, I was a bully. Mostly I teased other children about their clothes or poor grades. It wasn’t kind, I know now, but my fortunate upbringing hadn’t caused me to develop much empathy.

During recess, I had started to make fun of a young boy's tattered clothing when he punched me directly in the nose. My vision swam and I felt the warm blood trickle from my nose onto my lips. The other children began to laugh at me and even after all these years I can still feel the heat that rose in my cheeks.

I pummeled the poor kid. His initial blow had been enough to rattle me, but once I regained composure there wasn’t much of a fight to be had. A nearby teacher broke it up quickly and hauled us both to the principal’s office.

The principal rightly assessed that I had caused the fight and the other boy received no punishment. I, on the other hand, was suspended for the remainder of the week. I waited by the front door with my head hung low for my father to come to pick me up.

I received the lecture of a lifetime on the way home. My father told me he had never been more ashamed of me and I started to cry. It had never occurred to me until that moment what a hateful child I had been.

Later that evening as I tossed and turned in my bed I heard the door across the hall creak open. 

*Slam!*

*Thump!*

*Jingle!*

*Thump!*

*Jingle!*

*Thump!*

*Jingle!*

My door opened slowly and my grandmother’s face appeared. She smiled at me but I still remember how sad it looked. It was as though she had just finished crying. She dotted at the corner of her eye with the sleeve of her nightgown.

As she stepped into my room I could see a mason jar full of coins clutched in her hand. It rattled as she placed it gently on my dresser and made her way to me. Her wrinkled hand patted my leg as she settled down toward the foot of my bed.

“Little James,” she had said softly. “You had a poor day at school so I hear.”

I nodded and a great lump rose in my throat. 

“You must be kind to little boys and girls,” she continued without waiting for a response. “Bad things happen to little boys who do bad deeds.”

She lifted her shaking hand and pointed to the jar on my dresser.

“There are only nine coins in that jar now, James,” she said with a quiver in her voice. “There should be ten but you lost one today.”

“What do you mean, Gram?” I finally spoke. She turned her head to look at me and her face was now oddly devoid of emotion.

I’ll never forget the poem she told me.

*“Thomas Coin collected brass*

*For every crooked deed.*

*‘No evil act receives a pass’*

*This was the old man's creed.*

*For when each babe in town was born*

*Ten fine brass coins they gained.*

*But if they garnered Old Tom’s scorn*

*One brass coin less remained.*

*If all ten coins did disappear*

*The child’s time drew nigh.*

*Old Thomas Coin had made it clear*

*That all bad children die.*

*So do good deeds and please be kind*

*I beg you here and now*

*For ten poor deeds, I will remind*

*Are all that Thomas will allow.”*

Gram looked at me blankly after finishing the verses but I hadn’t been able to respond. She began to pat my leg again to comfort me. I felt uneasy after hearing her words.

“When I was a young girl I had a sister named Stephanie,” she told me. “She was sweet but prone to trickery and unkind deeds. Stephanie had been caught stealing a pastry from the town baker. Afterward, our grandmother told us the tale of Thomas Coin.”

She paused and looked toward the jar she had placed on my dresser.

After a few moments of silence, she began to tell me the legend of Thomas Coin. He had been a wealthy man who lived in her grandmother’s village. Mr. Coin had no family of his own so each time a baby was born he would visit the family and give them a jar filled with ten brass coins. The child would inherit them when they reached adulthood.

My grandmother explained that this was a great deal of money back then.

Thomas explained to the parents that the money was the child’s to keep but if he learned of any cruel or ill deed they performed he would return and collect one of the coins as a punishment. He told them he hoped it would help the children grow to be kind and helpful citizens.

Mr. Coin continued this ritual until he was found murdered in his home. A robber had broken into his cottage, beaten him to death with his walking stick, and stolen all of his money. The thief, perhaps superstitious, had placed two of the stolen coins on the old man’s eyes before leaving.

No thief was ever arrested but the town suspected a cruel boy named Michael had committed the crime.

Later that same week Michael reported to the local constable that someone had broken into his home and stolen the brass coins from his jar. The constables investigated but found no evidence that anyone had broken into the home. Michael was furious and began to harass townspeople in hopes of recovering his money.

The next morning Michael was found in a pool of blood in the town square. Two brass coins rested on his closed eyelids. There were no clues as to who had done this other than a set of footprints and the drag mark of a walking stick leading from the square. They ended at the empty cottage where Thomas had once lived.

Thomas, my grandmother finished, still reclaimed the coins from bad children even after his death. If they lost them all then Thomas would kill them.

“Did you or your sister lose any coins?” I asked numbly.

She nodded.

“I lost three and my sister lost six,” she responded. “You only have nine left after today, James. You must make kind choices.”

That evening stuck to my mind like glue for the remainder of my childhood years. After my grandmother passed away I took the jar of coins from my dresser and tucked it away at the top of my closet. In the few instances when I had done something particularly bad I would check the jar. To my surprise each time a coin had vanished.

After losing three coins I became a model citizen. Not that I was an extremely awful child before but the vanishing coins always filled me with fear. I assumed my parents had known the story as well and removed them when I got in some kind of trouble but I was never certain enough to risk it.

My younger brother Dennis was another story. While he had been a timid and well-behaved child his teenage years had brought about a great change. His quiet nature drifted away and he had grown openly hostile and disobedient to my parents. It wasn’t unusual for my brother to be caught doing drugs, sneaking out of the house at night, or picking fights with other kids at school.

“Did Gram ever tell you about Thomas Coin?” I asked him on a lazy afternoon when I had come home to visit from college. Dennis was now sixteen and I was nineteen. My mother and father had asked me to try and talk some sense into him one weekend while they were out of town.

We had spent most of the day in his bedroom playing video games.

“Oh yeah,” he responded. “Gram told me all about that goofy bullshit.”

“Have you ever counted the coins left in your jar?” I asked.

Dennis rolled his eyes. Tossing his controller beside me on the bed he walked to his sock drawer and pulled it open. The sound of metal clanking against glass startled me. He reached in and pulled out a mason jar that looked just like the one I had in my closet.

“Just one left,” he responded with a smile. “I guess old Tommy’ll be coming for me soon.”

I pleaded with Dennis to find a better set of friends and get his act together. It wasn’t necessarily that I believed Thomas Coin was real. It just broke my heart to see my little brother making bad choices that would affect his future in so many ways. His smiles and laughter at my pleas were enough to let me know nothing I said had made an impression.

“Look, James,” he responded flippantly. “It’s cool that Gram’s story about the old man’s coins scared you into living like a boy scout but I’m young and plan to have fun before I head off to college.”

Knowing I was making no progress I tossed the controller on the bed beside his and left the room. We didn’t speak for the remainder of the day.

I was awoken around 1:00 AM by the sound of the front door slamming. By the time I was able to groggily dash to the window I could already see Dennis vanish into the woods across the street. With mom and dad out of town, he had seized the opportunity to sneak out of the house.

In frustration, I attempted to call Dennis multiple times. Each call resulted in an immediate answer from his voice mail system. My text messages went unanswered. It remained this way through the entire night.

At some point, I drifted off to sleep in a chair downstairs as I waited for Dennis to return. My phone chirped loudly and the vibration on my lap woke me up. Sun was pouring in through the living room windows and I could see that Dennis’ car had not returned to the driveway.

I looked down at my phone expecting to see Dennis’ phone number on the ID but instead, I saw a number I didn’t recognize.

“Hello?” I said as I put the phone to my ear. 

“This is Captain William Pullman with the State Police,” a matter-of-fact voice burst through my phone speaker. “May I speak with James Compton?”

“This is him.”

“Mr. Compton, I’m sorry to inform you but we believe we’ve found the body of your brother, Dennis. Will you be able to come to the medical examiner's office to help make an ID?”

It only took me about twenty minutes to arrive at the medical examiner’s office after I had hung up the phone. The drive there was a blur and I can only imagine how many stop signs and red lights I plowed through. I felt how a horse must feel with blinders on. Only the destination remained ahead.

When I arrived a middle-aged man with a potbelly and thinning red hair met me at the door. He introduced himself as Captain Pullman. While he led me through the sterile waiting room and into the viewing area he explained to me that my brother had been found after a car break-in was reported.

Officers had arrived to see the door of a white Chevy Express van open into the street and a pair of legs dangling from the seat. During the approach, they could see thick ribbons of blood dripping out of the van onto the pavement. Dennis had died of blunt force trauma to the head while trying to hotwire the van.

Whoever had beaten him had also shoved two brass coins into his eye sockets.

After the officer finished describing the scene to me, the last thing I could recall was seeing a blanket of white overtake my vision before I passed out. I awoke later that day in my bedroom at my parent’s house. My father was sitting in the chair beside the bed and I could hear my mother wailing down the hall.

“Dad?” I said groggily.

“Yeah,” he replied flatly. I could see he had been crying. “You passed out at the office. The police hadn’t been able to reach us and… I’m sorry they called you down there to do that.”

I began to sob.

“Dad,” I cried. “I’m so sorry. I tried to talk to him but…” I couldn’t finish.

My father sat on the bed next to me and cradled my head to his chest just like he had done when I was a child. He had just lost his youngest son and his instinct was still to comfort me before caring for himself. I hoped at that moment to be the kind of father he had been to me and Dennis.

Later that evening after I was sure that my parents had gone to bed, I snuck to Dennis’s room. As quietly as I could I pushed the door open and tiptoed to his dresser. Pulling the top drawer out I rummaged around until my hand rubbed against smooth glass. Fishing the jar out I could see that it was empty. 

The single coin that had been there yesterday was gone.

Seven years after Dennis died my life had become happy and stable. I met my wife, Gwen, during college and we were fortunate enough to welcome our first child six months ago. Mom and dad have been over the moon since becoming grandparents.

We named him Dennis after his uncle.

Earlier this afternoon I told Gwen to go out with some friends and enjoy some baby-free time. Postpartum depression had been difficult for her. Dennis was also a finicky sleeper sometimes and she always felt the need to get up with him. I appreciated the sleep but she certainly deserved the break.

Dennis had just gone down for a nap about thirty minutes ago. I was still working from home and thought it would be an opportune time to go knock out tasks while I had some free time. The baby monitor on my desk showed Dennis fast asleep and I could hear the lullaby music that poured from the speaker near his bed. The camera’s night mode gave the monitor the appearance of an old black and white television set.

I don’t know if it was the general lack of sleep that all new parents suffered or if the lullaby had taken hold but at some point, I fell asleep in my office chair. It wasn’t a deep sleep as I found a few minutes later my attention was drawn to a noise in the hallway.

*Thud! Thud! Thump!*

*Jingle!*

*Thud! Thud! Thump!*

*Jingle!*

*Thud! Thud! Thump!*

*Jingle!*

Alertness didn’t fully return to me until I heard the creak of Dennis’s bedroom door on the monitor. I thought Gwen may have come home early so I looked closely at the screen. Nothing appeared at first other than the sleeping bundle in the middle of the crib.

A figure passed onto the screen and stood in front of Dennis.

The monitor was grainy and the black and white nighttime mode made it difficult to see but it looked like an old man propping himself up on a tall walking stick. His back was curved and there wasn’t a hair on top of his head. A bushy beard erupted from the sides of his head.

“A gift for you, young man!” A raspy voice proclaimed. “I hope you keep them all!”

I leaped from my chair and bounded down the hallway to my son’s room. The door was standing open even though I knew I had closed it for his nap. My eyes darted around the room but there was no one there. The window was still locked. If anyone had left the room I would have found them in the hallway.

My pulse began to lower and my ragged breathing evened out as I walked to the crib. I watched Dennis’ chest rise and fall in a peaceful rhythm that filled me with ease. Placing a hand on his chest I smiled and silently thanked God for giving me such a sweet kid.

I turned to leave the room and saw something out of place sitting on his changing table.

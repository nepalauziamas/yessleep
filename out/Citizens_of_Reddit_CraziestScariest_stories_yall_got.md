Citizens of Reddit what is the scariest/craziest thing to ever happen to you?
Mine~ When I was young (maybe 6-8) I had a nightmare, a young boy around 4 tragically drowned at the community pool. I didn’t recognize the kid or his family but I went to the funeral in the dream anyway, cried, did the whole thing in my dream. I woke up and immediately disregarded the dream as I was young and didn’t think much about dreams at that time. The next week I went out to the movies and lunch with my grandma. She took me to my favorite restaurant and on the way to the movies she asked me if I knew the little boy who passed. I wasn’t entirely sure what she was talking about. So she continued. 
Her- Did you not see the news? 
Me- girl I’m 7 I don’t watch the news….
Her- a little boy about four drowned in the area (I’m from a small town and she lived about 45 minutes away so I’m not sure what “area” was supposed to cover) and IMMEDIATELY it all flooded back to me in the dream like some kind of life flash and I saw it all over again it was the same boy and everything. I dreamt of this happening and then it ended up happening. Not really scary but it was very strange. 

PT 2 The same grandma was a paramedic (who occasionally had to do runs at state pen) in a really really bad area I mistakenly asked her what the worst thing she had seen was when I was about 15. She told me about this man who was in prison for murdering a bunch of people and he had scares all over his face like gnarly scars from some accident involving glass…. She said he may have been the meanest person he had ever been. This story scared me absolutely SHITLESS and I didn’t sleep for three days. I then had a dream when I finally fell asleep of this man with glowing orange eyes coming to off me. To make a long story short I have FUCKED UP dreams.

Fast forward to me being an adult and moving out on my own. One night I was walking my dog and this shirtless and shoeless man came up behind me and was fighting some imaginary enemy in the air. He then started chasing me he was clearly methed out. I ran to my apartment and didn’t sleep that night. About 4 weeks later the same man followed me to my place of work and when I refused to tell him my name, what I do and what department (in a hospital) he called me a stupid bitch and told me with my attitude he hopes I never speak to a patient then he turned around and sprinted away from me.  I have no idea what could’ve happened to me if I had given him the right information.  I told my dad about it and he stayed at my apartment with me for a week following just to make sure dude didn’t try to off me. I also reported him to the complex office and they told me “yeah some other residents have complained about him” NEVER saw him again though so who knows what happened to him.

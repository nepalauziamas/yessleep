This morning was great!

I woke up next to the woman of my dreams. Beautiful, intelligent, funny. We shared the same quick wit and sarcastic humour and I fell for her instantly.

We had only met the night before, both of us feeling the spark and she happily came home with me. We spent the entire night talking, laughing and getting high. 

I decided to take the short five mintute walk to the coffee shop and bring her back a cappuccino. On my way, I stopped by the local shop and picked up a scratch-card. I instantly scratched it at the counter;

*50,000...50,000...50,000*

My jaw dropped.

The shop attendant explained how to claim my prize and I happily went on my way. The biggest smile was plastered across my face. I was practically skipping down the road.

There's an alleyway entrance just before the coffee shop in which a man's voice, who somehow knew my name, beconed me to enter. There was something about his voice. I couldn't fathom it out. It simply pulled me in.

"You have one wish," his voice was very deep and strange. It was scary, yet, some how trustworthy and inticing at the same time. "But," he continued, "be careful with your words." 

And that was all he said. 

He just stood there in his hooded cloak, glaring at me. His liquid-gold eyes and slow breathing were equally soothing as they were terrifying.

Is he truly something magical and actually granting me a wish?...

With this fantastic day I was already having and the intensity of his whole being, I chose to believe him and took a few minutes to think about it.

He said to be careful with my words, probably because there'll be bad implications if I didn't word it correctly, as with all wishes, I suppose.

*I know...I Got it!*...

"I wish to be as happy every day, as I am today."

He bowed his head towards me. The hood of his cloak completely  engulfed the rest of his face and all I could still see, were them golden, flaming eyes. Then, that's when I felt the pain. He'd stabbed me with his extra long, razor sharp fingers. He dug in deep and directly into my upper stomach.

He then dragged me down the alleyway into nothing but bugs, dirt, and more bugs. It was a place no human comes to visit and lives to tell the tale. And this is where he unhinged and dumped me...Food for the bugs.

He sat with me until the end. Glaring into my soul. And saying absolutely nothing.

It takes between 24 and 48 hours for a person to die from a stab wound to the upper abdomen, but because of the bugs eating away at my decaying body, sepsis set in much faster, and I died at hour 15.

Before my world finally turned black, I heard his inticing voice once more;

"You're wish is granted."

It’s funny, the things we’ll take for granted, isn’t it? It’s almost just a hardwired instinct in a way for us to assume the world intends to keep spinning, and that things will be “okay”, for lack of a better word. “Blissful ignorance”, Right? But, of course, that’s not really much the case, is it? *But we’re supposed to believe it is...*

Forgive me, but I feel like it’s the only way to really start this. See, for a while, that’s what I always believed; the world will go on, until it doesn’t anymore. Until then, everything will go on and everything will be fine at the end of the day, right? Hope, I guess; that’s what it is. The reason we move forward, and the reason it always hurts to do so.

I learned this the hard way *that* day. Everything was perfect, and I can remember every bit of it. It was a Friday, I was off on PAID leave. It was me and him, William; my rock, my sunshine boy. We’d just spent the entire day together — something that, because of work the past few months, I’d been unable to do — and I’d finally be able to have the entire weekend to continue.

Between work like I just said, and having to fight with his mother; miss “I don’t want him growing up to be an immature jackass like you” on custody over him, this day was nothing short of a *BLESSING!* We went to the “Rip N’ Ride” water park on the other side of town. It was one of those indoor water parks with almost 3/4 of the place dedicated to the actual park, while the last little space was an arcade for whenever the kiddies wanted to call it quits with splashing around for the day.

As you can imagine, it wasn’t cheap — at all. But I couldn’t have cared less, even further splurging on snacks (which were also blown-out-the-ass expensive) and buying out damn near their entire stock of M&Ms. *Those were his favorites...*

(*I’m not sure I can do this... just breathe...*)

I had fun, sure. I actually felt somewhat like a kid again, myself. And William, he LOVED it. He kept me on my toes to keep up with him.

*\*\*\**

*“Bet ya I’ll make it down the slide before you, Dad!”*

*”Look at you, ridin’ the wave pool!”*

*”You’re the coolest, Dad!”*

*\*\*\**

Finally, after running around the place literally the entire day, the sun was going down and we left.  It was getting late, and we hadn’t had dinner yet, so I thought I’d hit the Mcdonalds drive thru on the way. Of course, William was on board with this, too. The boy LOVED Happy Meals....

What happened still feels distorted in a way. Surreal, like it *didn’t* actually happen. Yet, I know it did.

We were on the road, going pretty well under the speed limit — 55 on 60. The windows were down and Me and him were just jamming out my 80s Rock/ metal playlist playing from my phone when I saw it. It was two giant, bright balls of light. By the time I saw them, it was far too late.

In half a second, less than the time it took for me to even squint my eyes from the light, the car was sent careening off the road and straight into a ditch. Both because of the way the car hit the ditch, as well as the speed it was going, the car ended up flipping upside down, caving the roof down on top of us. The airbags deployed, but they may as well not have been there for as much good as it did.

It was about the third time my head cracked against the steering wheel that my vision went fuzzy. My head was swimming and nausea was running all throughout my body. The car was folded all around us, encasing us. Limply, I turned to look at William. His eyes were wide open, staring through the shattered windshield at the lights slowly approaching us.

His face was blank, lifeless. I could see him starting to bleed, both from his nose as well as his eyes. I thought he was *dead!*

“W-William”, I groaned, reaching out as best I could to him, trying to shake him awake. He didn’t respond or seem to even notice. His eyes stayed fixed to the windshield.

I followed his gaze, straining again to turn my head to the windshield. Outside, directly outside, seeming to sort of leer over the car, were the lights. Very faintly, more so subconsciously than anything else, I noticed something *off* about these two lights. I couldn’t really tell at the time, but now, looking back, I think I can better describe what I mean.

They weren’t like lightbulbs or any sort of artificial light source (a.k.a. Headlights). They were far brighter and I could feel some sort of... I don’t know... some sort of *energy* or aura. I guess what I’m trying to say is, these lights were *alive* somehow. They hovered directly over the overturned car, almost like they were “observing” us as I tried to struggle with getting myself free. William just continued staring at them, entranced by the way he was fixed to them.

“William”, I called out again, this time shouting. Still, no answer. I’d managed to get my seatbelt off of me and I was trying to do the same for William when I felt something begin burning my skin. I looked up to see the orb’s aura glowing brighter and brighter, generating into some sort of heat energy as it did so. It got hotter and hotter by the millisecond.

Suddenly, my heart rate was stopped abruptly when William let out the most shrill and horrifying screech I’d ever heard. It was abrupt, and as soon as it passed, so did he. His eyes, still bleeding, rolled back into his head before closing altogether. *I was sure he was dead!*

“WILLIAM! Oh God, Willia—”

I was cut off when an impossibly deep voice that came from both nowhere and everywhere at the same time bellowed; ***”Somnus!”*** In an instant, everything was dark, quiet. I couldn’t see or feel anything. I realized I was out cold. *”Am I dead?”*

I was reassured when I the smell of gasoline and smoke woke me up. My vision still wasn’t clear, but I could see more than enough to send me into another instant panic. Very faintly, I could see streaks of orange flickering and dancing across the outside of the car. My heart started jackhammering in my chest again, *”It’s gonna blow!”*

The next thing that happened is probably one of the biggest things that sticks out to me. Time was in slow motion, or to me it was, even if, in reality, only half a minute had actually passed. I started scrambling to unclip my seatbelt. After that, I started doing the same with William’s. He was unconscious now.

Once we’d both gotten free of the belts, I started pulling us out of the car through the windshield with all the strength possible for me. It’s true what they say, by the way, about adrenaline in life-threatening situations giving you a surge of strength that you wouldn’t have had normally. I found this out when I was able to actually somehow bend the metal around William away to be able to pull him from his seat.

Amidst all of this, I could hear sirens in the distance. Someone passing by must’ve called for help. Even still, this barely registered with me. I was focused on one thing; getting my son out of the fucking car before it blew to Hell and back. I managed to heave him out through the windshield when I heard it; the sound of the gas in the engine catching.

In one fluid motion, one single instant, I was able to grab the frame of the windshield and jerk myself out of the car right as the engine ignited. From right behind me, the car exploded, the force pushing me and William further away into the grass. Dazed, yet still coursing with the adrenaline, I dragged myself over to William.

I began shaking him. “William!” No response. He was profusely bleeding from his eyes and nose, as well as the gash in his forehead. “WILLIAM!”

My breaths were heavy. My head felt light. My vision faded slowly.

“William”, I shouted, starting to succumb to nausea. He was still out cold. I couldn’t even see his chest raising, he wasn’t breathing.

Finally, The burst wore off completely and everything was dark again. This time, it felt more natural (though still involuntary) when I slipped unconscious, unlike a minute ago. Still, nonetheless, everything was dark, quiet, and I couldn’t feel anything.

It was at this time that I first had the nightmare. It started with me hearing his voice, screaming, ***“Daddy! Help me!”*** I look around frantically to find where he is.

He’s nowhere in sight at first. Then his screams get louder. Louder. Closer and closer. I look beneath me, where I realize the sound is coming from. There, right below me, is my son, dragged screaming down a glowing, burning red vortex. ***“Daddy!”***

***“I’m coming, Willy, hold on!”*** I reach out as far as  I possibly can towards him. My arm isn’t long enough, however. I can’t reach him. He’s pulled further down.

Soon, I see his precious little eyes roll back into his head. His face begins to melt like wax in a candle. Finally, still screaming out for me, I watch helplessly as he’s engulfed by the vortex, effectively ceasing to exist. Horrified, I then watch the vortex reshape itself into a massive glowing orb, the same one I saw in the road.

It was a giant, and I; an insect. An ant to its boot. It loomed in front of me, eclipsing me, poised and ready to swallow me like it did my son.

I see it begin twitching, pulsing, like it has a heart inside of its burning mass, beating. It glows brighter and brighter, becoming almost blinding by the second, as well as burning hotter and hotter with each frantic undulation. I start to feel my own flesh searing.

I look down, petrified to see my skin was now actually melting as well. I try to scream, but my now seared vocal chords only allow me to choke out a pathetic wheezing. I helplessly watch the skin slowly and painfully liquefy and melt away from my bones until finally, I’m nothing more than a skeleton, still gasping to attempt screaming.

That’s when I woke up. I had to squint my eyes. This time, though, I knew it was just fluorescent lighting, not the orbs again. I was in a hospital bed.

My head felt like it’d been stuffed with a ten pound brick of lead. My body throbbed all over. My mind was fogged, thoughts clouded. Because of this, I couldn’t remember at first what had happened. *”What’s going on, why am I in the hospital?”*

I started looking around the room. *”Where’s William?”* Now, a jolt of anxiety was pulsing through me again, *”Where’s my son?! What happened?!”*

I went bolt upright in my bed right as one of the doctors walked in. He was startled at first when they saw this. He urged me to relax again and lay back down, but I wasn’t having any of it at the moment. I had to find my son.

“Where’s William?!”, I demanded. The doctor calmly stepped forward to the bed.

“Calm down, sir”, he replied, “you’ve had a bad—“

“WHERE’S MY SON?!” He stopped again, still calm.

“Sir, you’ve been in a bad accident. It would do you a lot of good if you’ll just lay back and relax.” I stayed upright, though my breathing and heart rate started to return to normal.

“Where’s William? What happened, what are you talking about “an accident?”

“You don’t remember anything”, he asked. I shook my head. My head was aching too much to really think, much less remember anything. “You and your son were in a real bad accident, sir. You’ve sustained massive injuries to your body and head.”

He, calmly approaching me once again, pulled a small flashlight from his pocket. Clicking it on, he said, “Can I get you to look directly at the light for me?” I did, squinting.

Part of me felt anxious, looking at the light. Something about it felt strange for some reason. It felt *terrifying.* It was bright orange, like any normal light — yet just like the thing in the—

**\*\*\***

***”William! WILLIAM!”***

*Smell of smoke pervades the air...*

*Flames dancing everywhere...*

*It’s hot...*

(*”Hell? The fires of Hell? No... no that’s not it...”*)

\*\*\*

*William; his face is melting...*

*He’s gone, devoured by the light...*

(*”Light, a bright light. A bright, glowing orb... just like the one being held right in front of—”*)

***”Daddy, save me!”***

\*A deep voice echoes through my head, resonating through my body as it likewise melts; ***”Somnus!”***

**\*\*\***

“William”, I shouted. The doctor retracted, startled.

“Sir, please calm dow—“ He cut off when he saw me bound up from the bed. My body ached and it was a struggle for to stand. I didn’t care though. I *couldn’t* care. *I had to see my son!*

I started limping to the door. “Sir, please”, I heard the doctor plea again, “you need rest!” I turned to him, my face no doubt looking like that of a maniac.

“The Hell I do”, I spat, “What I *need* is to find my son! Where is he?” He held up his hands, almost hostage-like, and told me he was in the room down the hall; Room 27B. I stumbled out of the room and hobbled down the hall.

My body was weak. I had to hold onto the railing on the wall to keep from collapsing. Still, I kept my eyes forward, focusing solely on the room; on William. I had every horrific thought imaginable running through my head at what I’d see when I got there.

I imagined seeing him in a full-body cast, hooked up from every angle with tubes and wires to various machines. I imagined him looking so badly battered that I wouldn’t even be able to recognize him anymore by looking at him. *I imagined he was dead!*

*”Oh sweet Jesus, PLEASE don’t let me be too late!”*

With the meager strength I had, I thrusted myself the last foot to the door of Room 27B, shoving the door open and slumping in like I was drunk. William was in the bed, out cold. Unlike what I’d feared I’d see, he wasn’t in any kind of cast or marred by severe lacerations or anything like that. He looked just fine, almost untouched in fact, save for a nasty cut along his forehead and a couple of bruises. *He looked peaceful.*

“William”, I whimpered, staggering to his bedside. Nothing. He was still, silent, unmoving. I shook him a bit, “William?!” He didn’t respond. Still, unmoving. Like he was a statue; a still, lifeless statue.

Like he was...

*“William?!”*

Like he was...

*William?! Come on, little buddy, wake up!”*

Like he was...

*”PLEASE WAKE UP!”*

(*Oh god...*)

*Like he was fucking dead!*

“Sir”, I heard from behind me, “You’re gonna have to step away.” I snapped my head to look back towards the door to see one of the doctors with a security worker beside him. I stayed put.

“I’m not leaving him!”

The doctor slowly approached, “Sir, please, you need to leave so we can do our job with your son.” I clutched the railing of William’s bed.

“I said I’m not leaving him”, I shouted. That was when I felt the security officer’s gigantic hands clamp tightly around my arms and begin trying to drag me away from the bed. “No, Goddamn it, you can’t do this”, I shrieked, trying to kick and claw at him to make him let go. You can’t take me away from—“ I blacked out when I felt something crack against the back of my head. Everything was dark again.

***\*\*\****

***”Daddy! Save me!”***

***”WILLIAM! Hang on; Daddy’s coming!”***

*I reach out to him, unable to grab him. His flesh is melting while he screams out for me. The vortex glows hotter again, brighter. William is gone.*

***”Noster est, tamen metu.”***

*The orb takes form once again. Now, it takes the form of a writhing mass of eyes, all of them different colors, with thin, wispy tendrils of light coiling from different areas. I’m frozen, paralyzed in terror. It looms over me once again.*

*The eyes start rapidly undulating. The eyes begin to glow all at once a deep, blood red. I can feel the heat intensify. My flesh begins to blister and peel.*

***”Surgit”***

***\*\*\****

I woke again to the hospital room I was in before. I was in the bed again, this time my wrists were strapped to the sides. “Forgive the restraints, but we can’t have another incident like that, Mr. Richter.”

I lolled my head around, my vision once again fuzzy. “Huh”, I groaned, feeling again the onset of a ferocious migraine. “Wha happuh?” I weakly tried pulling at the wrist straps.

“Just relax, Mr Richter. You’ve been in an accident. Your son is down the hall, being treated by our best staff. We’re doing everything we can and more for him. We’ll keep you informed on his condition, but for now, you need to focus on your own healing.”

I stopped pathetically struggling. My body was in pain, much more than before. Finally, I did as the doctor said and my body slowly relaxed in the bed. “There, that’s better, isn’t it?”

With this, my body stiffened. I didn’t have any kind of strength left to move any part of my body, the exception being to roll my head around limply like I lacked a spine. In spite of this, my mind seas anything but relaxed. I could feel it, kicked into overdrive; worrying, brooding over my son.

I couldn’t get the image out of my head; him just lying lifeless in the hospital bed like that. Was he going to be okay? What happened to him, there, trapped in the car? What caused him to scream when he looked at the orb *(The eyes...)*. "*What is his mother gonna say?"*

These, though, were inevitably shoved as far back as possible by the more pressing question; *Was he dead?*

*”No! Don’t dare allow that kind of thinking! He’s NOT DEAD! He’s gonna be alright! Everything will be alright...”*

No matter how much I clung helplessly to this, something in me, something deep inside, told me that things weren’t alright. That something wasn’t right with him, alive or not. *”But what?”*

This would, of course, cause me to think about the nightmares again. Specifically, the parts where William becomes swallowed by the vortex. Absorbed into its red hot mass. This was then followed by the bigger question, what the hell *was* this thing; the orb, the mass of eyeballs?

*"What do they want? What did they want with us on the road?"* Briefly, I remembered the things I heard it boom out in its thunderous voice. Obviously though, I couldn't understand a lick of it. Still, I knew, whatever it was, it had *something* to do with what was happening, especially with what happened to my son.

All of this would result in me spending that entire night wide awake, despite my body feeling *far* beyond exhausted. I just laid there in the hospital bed, wide awake, anxious, yet still, trying to keep from thinking about William's screaming face melting again (as well as trying not to picture that *thing* again). Finally, day broke. My body still largely felt like it was stuffed with bricks, but at least my headache seemed to have mostly subsided (*mostly*, not completely).

The doctors came in just a few hours later to begin running their routine tests on me. I didn’t struggle. Out of having no other choice, of course, given that I was still strapped to the bed, but I guess out of belief that they were right, too. I wasn’t any good to William if I, myself, was still in pain. So I decided to behave for the time being and let them do that; fix me.

The whole time, though, I still thought only of William. I asked about him at least every two to three times the doctors came to either check up or operate on me over the next five or so days. Each time, I was told the same thing; “He’s not woken up yet, but we’re still trying. He’s still alive, and we’ll make sure he stays that way.”

*(”Sure... “alive”...”)*

After about one to two and a half weeks passing by like this (though it didn’t feel like that, more like eternity passing in just a few short moments), I was finally cleared with a clean bill of health (overall, that is — I was given a cane, still having a bit of difficulty walking). What was the first thing I’d do after being discharged from my room? That’s right, go see William for myself.

I hobbled into his room. There he was, still fast asleep, *just like when he was a little baby.* One of the doctors was at the other side of the room, not having seen me come in. “H-how is he, doc?”

He turned around, startled. “Oh, sorry, I—“

He held up his hand, “It’s fine. I take it you’re this young man’s father?” I nodded. He chuckled, “Yes, I can see it now; the resemblance.”

I gave him a light smile. “Is he...”, I began, trailing off.

“Not sure yet. We’ve not been able to really tell, given that he hasn’t woke up yet.” My heart dropped into my stomach.

“Not once”, I asked, trying my absolute damnedest to keep collected as possible. He shook his head, looking at me in a frank manner.

“Afraid not. Unfortunately, it’s not uncommon, either; given what happened.”

“What isn’t?” He looked at William again. I followed his gaze. He was still, unmoving, *lifeless*.

“He’s comatose, I’m afraid”, I heard him answer. “Been that way since he’s been here.” I shuddered.

”Comatose”, I choked out. He nodded. “W-Wh-When will he wake up?”

“It’s hard to say”, he replied, sighing. “His vitals are steady, but his brain wave patterns are very faint.”

“What does that mean?”

He sighed again. The way in which he spoke sounded as if he’s been in this same situation, had to make this same speech, at least a good few times before. Desensitized, I guess you could say. “In short, he’s just short of brain dead. He’s alive, but unless he wakes up, which I wouldn’t count—“

“But it’s possible”, I blurted, cutting him off. “There’s a chance, right?” He just looked at me, that look of stoic uncertainty still pasted on his face. “Come on, there’s gotta be a chance, right?! You’re a doctor, right; there’s gotta be SOMETHING you can do, right?! Goddamn it, TELL ME THERE’S A CHANCE TO SAVE MY BOY!”

He sighed, looking to William. “You’re right, Mr. Richter, I am a doctor. I’m a few things, including a father myself. I’m also a realist. What I’m *not*, sir, is God.” He went quiet again, letting this hang in the air. “I’m afraid all we can do is continue observing him. Maybe with time, and perhaps a miracle, he’ll wake up.”

That was the last thing he said before leaving. I was alone again with my son. My sleeping, comatose, lifeless son. *My sunshine boy...*

“I’m sorry, Willy”, I sobbed, burying my face into his little chest. I thought of his sweet little face.

(*He always had the cutest little smile...*)

I thought of him running around on the playground, up and down the slides on the playground at the park, giggling.

*”You can’t catch me, na, na-na, na, na...”*

*Ready or not, here I come. Fee-fi-fo-fum!”*

I thought of seeing him running the bases at his little league baseball games. I always shouted from behind the fence. I never got to sit front row.

Or any row...

*I was never on time for a seat. I was at work.*

I thought of the time he competed in the spelling bee. He even competed nationally. He got to have his picture taken for the Gazette. *He won second prize!* I remember reading about it two days later...

I read about it...

*I wasn’t there. I had an "important meeting" to be at.*

I thought of his big birthday party. It was his sixth birthday. Chuck E Cheese. I thought of how his little face lit up when the cake was brought out. I remember how he’d managed to blow his candles out in one go before stuffing his sweet little cheeks with cake. At least, that’s what I saw from the video my friend, Zane, sent me later that night.

I watched it from a phone...

*I couldn’t be there. I had to work.*

I finally broke. “Oh god, William, I’m sorry! I’m a horrible daddy. Please come back, you’re all I’ve got! Please don’t leave me...”

*(“...Please don’t take my sunshine away...”)*

I broke when I felt a hand on my shoulder. It was soft, gentle. In an equally soothing tone, I heard the woman’s voice tell me that it was time for me to leave, that they had to do their routine tests on him. With one last look at him, I slowly rose and hobbled slowly out of the room. I was guided to the infimary.

There, I used their phone to call Zane to come pick me up and bring me home. I waited close to an hour and a half before he arrived. During this time, all I could do was stare at the wall, blankly, letting tears roll down lifeless cheeks. *lifeless, just like his.*

Zane was in shambles when I told him about it. He'd been close to William. A godfather, essentially.

*(He was more of a father than I was. He could be there.)*

He assured me that he'd be there if there was anything he could do. I thanked him and promised to keep in touch before heading inside my house. Almost immediately upon walking into my house, my dark, empty, quiet house, I broke.

I screamed. I howled. I wailed. I punched, kicked, threw anything I could grab across my fucking living room, before finally collapsing, bawling like a little kid. *"God, Please... If you can hear me, if you really care about me, I beg you, give me back my son. Please, give me another chance to be the father he deserves."*

Exhausted in every way, I fell asleep there, sprawled in the middle of the floor of my wrecked living room. That time, I saw it again; The orb, the mass of eyeballs. My nightmare...

**\*\*\***

*It lords over me once again. I'm frozen in terror. Like before, it glows bright red as a deep echo resonates through the void, through my body.*

***"Timorem tuum sentimus. Puer noster est. Metu tenetis, sicut tu et ceteri omnes."***

*My blood freezes solid, despite the intense heat radiating from the thing. My mind is a frenzied beehive, a million thoughts racing around all at once.*

*"What is it saying? Why is it doing this, what does it want? What has it done with my son?"*

*Almost to reply to this, I then hear William squealing again,* ***"Daddy, save me!"***

***"What are you?!"*** *I cry out. The voice booms again.*

***"Dominum tuum sumus. Imperamus. Damus. et aufermus.***  ***Per timorem regnamus."***

*I try to reach inside the thing, plunging my hand deep inside the mass of eyeballs. I was going to save William. Instantly, my hand begins charring, soon catching on fire entirely.*

*Excruciating pain flows throughout my body as the flames travel from my arm to the rest of me, engulfing me. My own screams of agony become drowned out by William's pleading. I hear his voice as my body burns away.*

***"Daddy, Save me!"***

**\*\*\***

I woke up, panicking and sweating profusely. *"What the hell?!"* I looked at my hands. I was still whole. I then looked around the living room. It was dark still. Quiet. Empty.

I went to the bathroom, where I began splashing cold water on my face. I looked into the mirror, seeing large, dark rings under my eyes as well as sagging cheeks and eyelids. I looked horrible.

I closed my eyes, *"Come on Sol, get it together. You're no good to him like this."* I was in the middle of splashing more water on my face when my phone started buzzing with a call. Looking at it, I saw that it was from the hospital. I answered it, closing my eyes, fearing the worst.

*"God, no, please let him be okay."*

\-- "Hello?"

**-- "Hello, this is Kathy with Salvitore Memorial Hospital. Is this Solomon Richter?**

\-- "It is. Is this about William? Is he alright?"

*"Please let him be alright!"*

**-- "We request you to come to the hospital immediately. It concerns your son."**

My heart stopped. I could feel a lump hanging in my throat like a sack of rocks. *"Oh Jesus, no..."*

\-- "I'm on my way. Do I need to come alone or--"

**-- "Yes, it is best that you come alone."**

I hung up and called Zane, telling him to take me back to the hospital immediately. When he got there, about five minutes later, I all but flew out the front door (not bothering or caring enough to lock it). “What is it?” he asked on the way there. I didn’t answer.

When we got to the hospital, I jumped out of the car and bolted inside, immediately heading for his room. My heart thundered. My mind was a Mach 7 race car engine. Everything seemed to spiral around me, almost to a point where nothing felt real.

Without hesitating, I burst through the door to William’s room. A doctor was over at the left of the room, washing his hands. In the bed, though, was William, eyes open. My jaw dropped slack, my heart frozen, *”He’s awake!”*

An emotional typhoon washed over me, and I couldn’t move. I didn’t know what to do. Do I run over and throw myself at him, clamping him in the tightest bear hug humanly possible, or jump around, shouting and howling for joy like a fuckin’ maniac?

What would I say? I felt like “I love you” and “Thank God, you’re okay” just weren’t right here. They weren’t accurate to what I truly felt — that is, I didn’t really *know* exactly what I truly felt. The best way to describe it, I guess, was the perfect ratio of blended relief and delirium. “Surreal”, maybe, like it still didn’t feel real, you know?

*(It still doesn’t feel real. It never will)*

He was looking up at the ceiling, blankly. The doctor turned to me and said, “Ahh, yes, good, you’re here.” I turned to him, my mind still in a deadlocked state.

“I-I-Is... Is he...” I couldn’t form the words. Luckily, he seemed to know where I was going anyway.

“Yes, just woke up an hour ago.”

*”He’s awake!”*

“W-William”, I muttered softly, eyes starting to burn. He didn’t respond. “William, son... it’s me, it’s Daddy.” I slowly approached the bed. His head turned to me, his doe brown eyes locking gaze with me.

I approached closer. He stared at me. I reached out to him about a foot away from him. He stared at me.

I stroked his cheek, tears flowing freely down my face. He just stared at me. I threw my arms around him and started bawling like I did before. He just stared at me. “Oh, God, I’m so sorry William! I’m gonna make everything up to you, I promise! I swear, I won’t let anything happen to you again!”

He didn’t move. He didn’t speak. He just stared at me.

I felt the doctor’s hand on my shoulder and I broke away (hesitantly) from William.

*(He just kept staring at me...)*

He guided me back into the hall and handed me a tissue. After giving me a minute to, at least *somewhat* collect myself again, he told me that they were going to continue running tests to make sure  he hadn't developed any sort of brain trauma or any severe damage to his brain. "Gotta be careful", he said, "you never know what kind of effect *that* kind of head trauma could have on a young boy like him."

I looked up, first at him, and then to the room again. "What do you mean?" I asked. He told me that it was likely that, though William was awake, that he may have certain "complications", as he put it, mentally. "You mean like a concussion?"

"If he's lucky, that's all he'll have to worry about. I didn't lie to you before, Mr. Richter, and I won't now. the damage he sustained in the accident was intense. Being as young as he is, I'm honestly shocked myself he came out of the coma."

I just kept staring at the door to the room. I was barely even listening, in all honesty. I heard, or at least I *focused* on one thing; William was alive, *he was awake!*

He sighed, "Of course, I suppose in that respect, I *should* perhaps have a bit of faith. Your boy's certainly a resilient one, Mr. Richter. Quite a survivor, I must say." With that, he walked away down the hall. I went back into the room. *"He's resilient. He's a survivor."*

William was sitting up in his bed, his eyes never having left the door. His face was blank, devoid of emotion. Devoid of thought, of *humanity* almost. Hollow. 

"William", I said softly, still struggling to keep from breaking down again. "Hey, buddy, you feelin' okay, champ?" Nothing. "You want me to bring you anything, maybe have uncle Zane bring you a little somethin' like a Happy Meal?" Nothing. 

I felt a lump form in my throat. *"Why won't he say anything?"* I swallowed hard and said, "That's okay, you don't have to say anything right now. You just get better at your own little pace and we'll be outta here in no time." He just kept staring at me. I struggled to force a half-assed smile.

*(Say something...)*

"Okay, well I'm here, sport. I won't go anywhere 'till you can come out with me, okay?" Nothing. I got up and made my way to the door. "I promise, I'll be right outside if you need me."

*(Please say something!)*

"I... I love you, son..."

*(ANYTHING!)*

"He's not going anywhere." I stopped. I stared back at him, jaw hanging limply. That was him; *he'd just spoken!* 

"William?!" I cried, feeling a rush of joy rising inside me again. He stared at me, noticeably even more blank somehow than before, looking like he was hypnotized or something. *(Like he was empty)*

I slowly approached his bed again. "William isn't leaving. William is ours." 

I stopped. "What?" His head cocked to the side.

"We have William, he is with us; part of us." My heart was sent racing again (for about the thousandth time at least that night -- somehow not yet killing me of a heart attack). "What? buddy, what're you--"

"We are taking back what's ours." He snapped. His voice, despite sounding as emotionless as his face looked, still sounded, and felt, like it was laced to the brim with white-hot venom. "He belongs to us. *You* belong to us. This world belongs to **us**!"

My entire body became cold. My mouth felt dry, unnaturally so. I stood frozen where I was. *"What the hell? What's going on, Why is he talking like this?"*

I was nervous now. He finally spoke, but what the hell was he saying? Why was he saying; "William is ours"? Hell, more than this, what was he talking about when he said; "Belongs to us"; *Who was he talking about?*

He sat there, staring at me. 

*(Those eyes...)*

I tried to smile again. "You're funny, little buddy. You just get some rest, okay?" He sat silent, staring. 

*(Something about the eyes...)*

He pointed at me.

 (*The eyes were wrong!)* 

 "You belong to us. We reign. He cannot be taken from us, and your hold in him will give you to us as well. You have not been taken from us."

I noticed then as he said this how his eyes were now different. How they were *changed.* His left one was a golden color, while his right was now a dark shade of scarlet.

 *(I'd seen them before...)*

"William, are you okay? What's going on with your eyes?" 

"William is not here, Solomon. He is in here, with us."

"What are you talking about?" I began making my way over to the button to summon the doctor again. He stared at me, his face now forming a grin. It wasn't his usual, beaming little smile, though. In fact, it wasn't the smile of a little boy. It was a face I only ever thought could've existed in my weirdest dreams. *"Only in my nightmares..."*

*"Nightmares like..."*

*(I'd seen this before...)*

I looked at him. His eyes, both of them, appeared brighter in their respective colors; seeming to glow almost. "You're afraid, aren't you?" The air became heavy, making the act of breathing feel straining. "Good", he said, cocking his head to the side, "The gate is still open, we still have you. We will always have you, because of him. You'll never let him go."

"That's enough, William!" I shouted. Anxiety rushed through my body, causing my head to spin rapidly. I didn't know what else to do or what to say. I didn't know what the fuck was going on. 

What was going on with my son? Why was he acting like this? What was he saying, and why? Briefly, while looking at him smiling that malicious smile at me, I thought about what the doctor said about "Complications", about the possible after effects of the trauma from the accident. Based on what I was hearing, I wondered if perhaps the development of some sort of personality disorder might be one of them.   

*"Why does he want me to be afraid?"*

*(He said the gate was still open... They still had me because of him...)*

His eyes really were glowing now; one gleaming a golden aura while the other beamed red. He opened his mouth and out came one sentence, one phrase, bellowed in a voice that was his -- yet at the same time, wasn't; ***"Per timorem regnamus."***

My heart stopped completely. It all came back to me. The accident, the orbs, the nightmares, *The eyes!* These pieces started connecting themselves in my mind with what was happening now. *"This isn't William!"*

"Wh-Who... What are you?" I asked, quivering. His eyes still glowing, burning, he opened his mouth again and his voice echoed; ***"Deus tuus sumus, et nostra aufermus; incipiens a te et filio tuo."*** Accompanying this, I could hear William's voice whisper; *"We are your God, and we are taking what's ours; starting with you and your son."*

His eyes glowed brighter and brighter and I began to hear screaming inside my head. I heard William again, begging for me to save him, as well as others; ones I didn't recognize at all (though I still remember them just as vividly). The intensity caused me to feel like my head was gonna explode at any second the longer I looked into his eyes, into *them.*

Finally, I willed my eyes closed and turned to run for the door. I made it out of the door, slamming the door shut and bracing myself against it. For a moment, I just stood against the door, breathless, admittedly half expecting something extreme to happen, like for William to either bash down or disintegrate it somehow. It didn't though.

Eventually, the adrenaline wore off and I slid down, collapsing to my knees, howling and bawling again. *Just like I did before.*

This time, of course, was different, though. This wasn't just grief. This wasn't just regret. This wasn't just worry or anxiety. This wasn't even just confusion. This was all of those mixed together to form one horrible concoction; pure cold terror. *It was madness itself!*

The noise caused the doctors and nurses, as well as a few of the security officers on duty, to come rushing to me. They tried asking me frantically what was wrong; what had happened, but I was all but inconsolable. I could only babble idiotically through my hysterics. 

I finally stopped when I felt a sharp pinch, followed by everything going dark again. This time, I didn't dream -- if I was ever really dreaming at all before. Rather, I just heard a confusing blend of both William's laughing, his crying, begging for salvation, and the thing's; "God's" statement playing in a constant loop. ***"The gate is still open, we still have you. We will always have you, because of him. You'll never let him go."***

I woke up just an hour ago now, laying across one of the couches in the infirmary. Those words have made me finally realize what happened, and what I'm gonna have to do now. Who or whatever these things are; they've taken my son. When they attacked us on the road, causing the accident, they somehow entered him to use as a vessel; a conduit, a puppet to spread their influence with. And my nightmares must've acted as the key to his mind, body, and soul; "The Gate".

I wanted to save him, and in turn, ended up allowing them to take him. He was my rock, he was everything; my world. My world that, for so long, I'd neglected. Because of this, I feared that I'd lose him, which drew these things to him. They preyed on this fear, knowing I wouldn't let him go, and now my worst nightmare is a waking reality. 

I write this now to say that, while I don't want to do it, I know I have to. It's the only way I know to free him, at least, in part. My fear of losing him caused them to take him, so I have to let him go. It's getting late, and the guards have already patrolled the hall. When I finish, I'm gonna sneak down the hall and into his room with a pillow. I'm gonna get one last look at his sweet little face, before quietly setting him free from their bond. 

And when the time comes and I have to answer for what I've done, I can at least take comfort knowing that I took him from them. *I closed the gate.*

He's asleep again. He looks so peaceful. *"Good night, my son... I love you..."*

*("You are my sunshine, my only sunshine. You make me happy, when skies are gray...)*

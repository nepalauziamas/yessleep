I tried to remember my past as much as possible, but only snippets came through the great fog that had taken over my mind. My eyes were shut tightly as I tried my hardest to remember. I knew I was in an unfamiliar place by the feel of the bed, but I had no clue how I came to be there. 

My name is Callum. I have a wife. A wife named . . . I couldn’t remember. 

I tried again. 

My name is Callum. I live in a small town. In Maryland I think. Called . . . 
Called what?
I didn’t know. But what I did know was that this wasn’t my house. 

I opened my eyes for the first time since awakening, and my prediction was correct. This wasn’t my house. But how was I here and why? 

The first thing I noticed about this place was the dark, somber lighting coming from candle holders on the walls. The candle holders were positioned about 5 feet up, and they were on walls covered that were covered in light blue and gold crown decorated wallpapers. It was like something out of the 1800’s. In front of me, lay a large, ornate window. Through it, all I could see was a vast and gorgeous sunset.

I stepped out of bed onto a dark-stained hardwood floor that possessed a slight creak. My feet were bare and the wood cold. When first standing up, I felt a strong sense of nausea and dizziness and almost completely lost my balance. How long had I been in that bed? 

My first course of action was to exit this bedroom and have a look around this place and find out who might have brought me here. 

I exited the bedroom through a marvelous and overly dramatic doorway for a bedroom. It expanded upwards almost ten feet and was the same dark wood as the flooring. It was engraved with gold crowns. The doorknob was large and gilded and felt slightly resistant when I turned it to leave the room. 

Through the door was a comparably elegant but dark and ominous hallway. It was not long, but it was also long enough to create a sense of foreboding and ominosity. 

I walked down it, trying to hide my uneasiness because surely, someone would be there to greet me. Right? 

No. 

I looked over the entire house and found no sign of any person or any life at all. The decorations stayed on suit with the bedroom and hallway. Nothing stood out about it, except the continuous darkness that seemed to pierce every corner even though there were the same large, ornate windows every where.

By this time, dread and fear filled up my entire being. Where was I? Where was everyone else? How the fuck did I get here?

Dozens of similar questions flooded my mind, and to answer them, I decided to go see what my outside surroundings looked like. I made my way past large sophisticated looking couches and tables to the front door which bared a similar look to my bedroom door. Only this one was even larger. 

What I found made me scream out  in complete and utter shock. 
“What the fuck!” 
Beyond a medium-sized porch lay — nothing. It was all just that vast sunset that had greeted me when I first awoke in this scary place. 

There was no sun that was apparent anywhere though. The infinite sky just seemed to emit light that cast a brilliant glow onto a never ending expanse of wispy and hazy clouds. 

I drew back. How was I here? How was HERE here? I did not know. My mind couldn’t possibly imagine the answer. So I put my mind somewhere else. 

And that “else” was survival. The house was from the 1800’s, and it seemed to not have been touched ever since. There was no fridge. There was no food present anywhere. And there was no where to go. 

Though I was not yet hungry, I grew frantic for food. I found nothing throughout the entire house and my heart sank even though it was still beating hard and fast from the adrenaline this situation had bestowed upon me.

I couldn’t accept my certain death so I went to bed as the nonexistent sun faded below a nonexistent horizon and everything was enveloped in a deeper darkness. 

I stayed in denial for the next two days as the first pangs of hunger crept into my abdomen. 

On the third day however, I realized something. There was still a sunrise and sunset. Time was still a thing. I was still connected to the real world somehow. 

But soon after this realization, my newfound hope quickly faded. There was nothing I could do with this information except wait for something to happen. 

I returned to the porch and sunk into a rocking chair that was located there. And I sat there. For what felt like centuries. For all I know, it was. 

I tossed a couch into the void on the fifth day because I had become overrun with shear boredom. I watched it fall with mild satisfaction. This was like something I would do as a child. Sighing, I sat down into the rocking chair again. I couldn’t even remember my childhood. 

I began to think about my present situation some more. This time, I did not withdraw from supernatural speculations. Could this be purgatory? Though I was not religious, it seemed like a fitting answer. Stuck in the abyss with just my lack of memory but cursed with endless thought.

On the morning of the sixth day, the first sign of life was made evident by a knocking on the door. I bolted out of the bedroom and through the hallway to the front door, but I paused when I reached it. “How . . .” I said aloud. My voice was raspy due to lack of use. 

I did not dwell on the how for long though, for I didn’t want to miss this chance. For all I knew, it would be the only one. 

I jerked the door open and promptly screeched my lungs out, falling backwards at what rested at the doorway. 

Dangling upside-down, tied to the patio overhang, was the corpse of a young woman — completely naked. Her body was covered in skin lesions and possessed a horrific, deep green hue. Her private areas were torn and stained with blood from assumed rape and misuse. Her arms swung slightly next to her head even though there wasn’t a hint of wind. At the end of her arm right arm, there was a fingerless hand, and on the right arm, there was a hand missing two fingers, presumably to form the symbol of 3. Further proving this theory, large words were carved deep across her breasts. “3 Days.” Her eyes still portrayed a sense of life and seemed to lack the decay that was present throughout the rest of the body. They stared directly into my eyes and tracked my movements.

During my fall, I had broken a decorative wooden table in half, and I still lay in the pile of broken wood. I picked up a sharp broken leg from the table and held it cautiously. Whoever put the corpse here had to still be around. Or did it get here on its own? It was still staring at me, and I was still staring back, overwhelmed with shock and nausea at its sight. 
“Are — are you still alive?” I asked, my voice quavering slightly. 

No response. 

Cautiously, I crawled to my feet, feeling my body for any damage from the fall. There was nothing major. 

After deciding that I was in no imminent danger because nothing had tried to kill me yet, I examined the corpse some more, thinking about how it got here and it’s cryptic message. I didn’t dwell on the “how” for long. Stranger things had happened before this, for I was standing at that very moment in a house surrounded by complete void. 

But what did this lifelike corpse mean? Three days until what? I had no answers except to wait and see what happened in three days. 

That night, I, understandably, could not sleep, for I had left a somewhat dead, violated corpse hanging at my doorstep. I kept my makeshift weapon from earlier close by at my bedside table. 

I woke up in one piece the next morning, and the first thing I did was go back to my front door.
When I opened it though, I found a new, equally horrible surprise, but it was, nonetheless, less shocking than the day before. Replacing the corpse from yesterday, was a little dead girl, hanging in the same way.  

I did not recoil this time but left the door at my own free will, for my nausea had reached a new level, and I receded to the bathroom to puke up the little remaining food that was left in my stomach.

When I regained my wits, I returned to the doorway. The little girl still dangled there, eyes staring at me in the same, horrific, lifelike way. A deep gash stretched around her entire neck, and I could make out her spinal cord in some spots upon further investigation. This girl of no more than about 10 had been brutally executed. If I had anything left in my stomach, I would have gone and thrown it up again.

Fortunately, she was fully clothed to some extent, leading me to believe she had not been raped like the woman. She wore a pair of black leggings, torn open near her kneecaps which looked to be bloodied. Her shirt was ripped down the middle and caked with dirt and presumably dried blood. 
On her upside down forehead was another message. 
“2 days.”

Would I end up like these two victims if I allowed more time to pass? I didn’t want to find out, but there was nothing else to do. No where else to go. 

I sat in my rocking chair next to the deceased child all day that day. I needed to know how the other one disappeared last night. I sat until nighttime, chair-stake at the ready. 

After about 5 hours of darkness, still sitting in my chair, the first signs of motion were made evident out of the corner of my eye. 

The girl’s rope was slowly turning around, her face moving towards the direction of the void. I remained completely motionless, not wanting to catch the attention of whatever forces were acting on her, for they, surely, could act the same upon my body.

When she had made a complete 180, the rope snapped, unceremoniously dropping the child to the ground. I heard what I thought was her neck snapping as her head bent at an unfortunate angle. And then her body was dragged over the edge of the porch in a quick, but unexpectedly graceful way. In fact, it seemed as if she had almost melted over the edge. 

I abandoned my statue impersonation and ran over to the edge of the porch and looked over it. The girl was not falling as I had expected, but she was continuing her graceful slide down the endless stone foundation of the house in a slow but eerie process.

After she disappeared into the deep darkness, I withdrew from the edge, not wanting to get pushed in behind her. Sitting down back into my chair, I continued to wait to see if another corpse presented itself while thinking about what was presenting me these horrible bodies and why. 

Why?

Was this my family? 

No. Please no. 

I did not want to be right, but I knew I was the second the thought had appeared in my brain. The woman was my wife, the partially decapitated girl my young daughter. 

I wept, and the first thoughts of suicide pushed themselves into my mind. I tried to ignore it, but as each body presented themselves back into my mind, I began to fall for the option. I could jump in after them, or I could wait to see what was to come in two days. For now, I accepted the latter. 

I woke up in the bedroom after the sun had already come up. I had no recollection of ever leaving the rocking chair, and I imagined I didn’t. The Force must have transported me back into the house. This slightly reassured me because it revealed that it did not want to hurt me. At least for now. 

I despairingly trudged back to the door, already knowing what waited for me. When I opened it, my theory was confirmed, but this one inflicted even more pain and grief upon me.

Tied up like a fish was a young boy of indistinguishable age, for there was not enough left of him to decipher that information. His neck was only a blood stump, still slightly dripping some thick blood onto the porch in front of me. The head lay facing me on the ground in a pile of blood. His tongue lay sprawled out before his skull. The words “Last Chance” cut deeply into it. 

“Why,” I cried out into the empty void. “WHY ME!” 
“WHAT DID I DO TO DESERVE THIS!” 

I stood, weeping, feet overhanging the eternal pit. I hoped the Force would push me in and end all my grief and indecisiveness. This was all my family that had been tossed on my front doorstep like a worthless package. There was nothing I could do about it at this point, and the only chance I had to leave this place and have a possibility of seeing my family in the afterlife was to jump. 

But I couldn’t do it. 

I cursed my strong willpower and resolved myself back to my home in the rocking chair, waiting for my inevitable doom as my “last chance” faded away.

I fell asleep in that rocking chair as the sun began to fade that night.

I woke up back in the bed midway through the night from the smell of smoke and a strong sensation of heat. Hastily, I removed myself from the bed and opened the bedroom door into a full-fledged inferno. The entire living room was caught in massive flames that continued to spread as if the floors were coated in gasoline. I screamed in fear and closed myself back into the bedroom which was momentarily undamaged. I crawled into the corner. This wasn’t how I wanted to end. I didn’t want to burn alive. I didn’t want to experience that tremendous, unimaginable amount of pain as my skin melted off my body. Why didn’t I just jump off the porch? The Force had even told me that it was my “last chance.” Why didn’t I listen?” 

I stood back up, pushing my fear into the back of my mind. I began to charge towards the door, knowing that making it to the abyss was my only way of escaping the worst death I could possibly imagine. 

I punched through the door and continued to fill sprint towards the front door. Everything was engulfed in flames. I was running through fire, a mix of adrenaline and my strong willpower overcoming the pain. I reached the front door and body slammed through it. Not even thinking or contemplating my actions, I carried my momentum out into the void and began the eternal but painless fall.

I woke up after what felt like centuries later. The first thing I noticed was the sensation of being in a completely different bed. The next, I realized with a start as I opened my eyes, was that I remembered everything. My family, my friends, my past. Everything except the events leading up to my purgatory.

I realized I was in a hospital bed, IV’s sticking out of multiple places almost my arms. Nonetheless, I attempted to get up out of the bed, but a sharp and strong burning sensation in my legs made me exhale out a groan and forced me to collapse back into my bed. My groan prompted the assistance of a nurse who seemed extremely shocked to see my awakening. 

“Wha — what happen?” I managed to mumble out with great effort. 

“You were attacked by a serial killer called ‘The Reaper.’ You’ve been in a coma for almost two weeks now,” she stated. “You—you’re his only victim to ever survive. You’re a miracle.”

“I’m—I’m the only one?” I asked shakily. “My wife? My kids?”
The nurse patted my arm reassuringly. “They were not attacked. I can’t say I know their whereabouts, but I can guarantee you that much. I assume they have been putt into witness protection, but that is my only guess.” 
I sighed with relief. Their deaths had only been a part of the vision. 
“Callum?” She asked hesitantly to regain my attention. 
“Yes?” 
“There’s more I’m afraid. You. . .” 
It took her a few seconds to figure out how to phrase her statement. 
“You were on fire. Not after the attack but—but just last night.
“We couldn’t explain it. It’s as if you had been damned to Hell.”

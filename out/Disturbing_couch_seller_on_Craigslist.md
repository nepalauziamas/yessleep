I will try to write this story in the most detailed way I can.

Just two weeks ago, I heard the trash can next to my house being kicked and falling in the middle of the night, then I heard the sound of glass breaking and a rock was thrown at my bedroom window, shattering it. Then I heard someone rushing to a car and begins flooring it.  
which is why I just started writing this story. However, this has a backstory. Also a scary one.

It's all started since I started using a site called Craigslist. I wanted to buy a new couch for my house, and a lot of friends told me about this site, so I thought why not use it to check out deals for a new couch. There was a sale on a white couch which I really liked, and the price was very good.

I will call the couch seller Tom, so as not to disclose personal information about him. I asked him about the couch, and he said she was in really good condition as in the picture, and that I could come to his house to pick her up. The address he gave me led to a relatively small house near a forest path.

(Again, I will not reveal names so as not to violate anyone's privacy.) He told me to come to his house around 6pm, so a few days later I arranged with Tom to come and pick up the couch. He said I could come, so I got in my car and drove to his house.

The house is located a few miles outside a small town. \* It's worth noting that neighborhood in which that house was located wasn't known to be dangerous.

After about half an hour of driving I arrived at the address. It was a small 2 story house. I knocked on the door, and after about half a minute a man opened the door, I would say in the mid-forties. The man looked completely normal. He said to come in and he would show me the couch. I went inside and the couch he showed me looked just like in the picture, and Tom also said he would help me move the couch to the trunk of my SUV, nice guy, I thought. After we finished putting the couch in the trunk, I said goodbye to Tom, and so did he.

So far the story sounds pretty normal. But from here it starts to change a bit. I hopped in my car, and after about a quarter of an hour of driving home when I got to a more urban area, I noticed that the vehicle behind me was behaving a little strangely.

After a few minutes I realized he was following every turn I made with my vehicle. At first I thought it was just a coincidence, or maybe we were just driving to two areas close to each other. So I did not really pay close attention. But after a few more minutes of intentionally making wrong turns, I realized that the vehicle is not actually leaving me, it was, in fact, following me all this time, wrong turn after wrong turn. At this point I was quite concerned. I started to drive at a higher speed. At some point in the ride, with the vehicle still following me, I looked in the rearview mirror again. I noticed that the vehicle was a little closer to me now, and it gave me a little better look at the vehicle, and who was driving it. I'm not sure what model it was, but it looked like an old red Toyota. The face was familiar, but I could not put my finger on it. 

After about a minute of trying to crack why this man seemed so familiar to me, I understood why, and it struck me. This driver is Tom. And he looks exactly like him. I no longer knew what to do at this point, so I called 911 and reported a vehicle following me, and I told them the area in which I was driving in, while driving at very high speeds. 

Sometime later I saw that the vehicle was no longer behind me, and I guess it was because the driver realized I had already called the police.

I parked my car in the parking lot of a nearby shopping center, and reported my current location to the dispatcher, So they can get to the location and I will give details about the man. Unfortunately, by the time I remembered to open the couch ad on Craigslist, It was already long since deleted by then.  I'm stupid, I had to take a screenshot of the ad straight away when I saw things start to get weird.

The cops came and I told them about the incident. They took details like a description of the man, and my rough estimate of what I believe the car he drove looked like. They told me they would try to find the man. I have not yet received information from the police regarding the man.

The whole story so far happened about a month and a half ago.

But 2 weeks ago, I heard the trash can next to my house being kicked and falling in the middle of the night, then I heard the sound of glass breaking and a rock was thrown at my bedroom window, shattering it. Then I heard someone rushing to a car and begins flooring it.

I immediately called 911, But when they arrived the person was long gone by then. I showed them my shattered bedroom window and they left. The man has not yet been found. Since the incident I have started installing security cameras in my house so that if something like this happens I can have a video.

 I'm not sure if this incident is related to the incident I had with Tom, the couch seller, but I believe there is a connection. If I receive new information regarding one of the events I will update them in a new post. It's a pretty long story and I hope you enjoyed reading it. Peace.

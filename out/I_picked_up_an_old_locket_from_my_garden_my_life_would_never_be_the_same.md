I was never one to believe gods or any foreign spiritual entities. But I’m usually open to the idea of there being a god or gods to keep an open mind god forbid I die one day and pearly gates were real. My mom also did bless the house so in the event one day I find that demonic entities of a fourth dimension are real maybe the fact that they blessed it would come in handy. 

My day was going pretty well for the time being. My dad and I were reworking the garden and I’d seen something a bit shiny from the bottom of my eyes. I grabbed it and whipped he dirt off it, it seemed to be a gold locket of some sort, in the locket was a picture of a nun, she was beautiful, blue eyes and a soft smile. The locket was damaged badly scratches all over and the necklace part of it was gone. I ran upstairs and set down on the heater in my room and continued to help my dad fix up the garden. 

Later that night I’d went to sleep my body felt like it was getting heavier and heavier, it felt as if 100 men were sitting on top of my back all at once, as if every single cell in my body was spasming. My adrenaline was kicking in yet I found it impossible to even move a muscle or even open my eyes for that matter. Yet I knew I was awake sort of. A scene starts kicking in, I was falling, falling from the night sky. 

I’ve had a couple lucid dreams before but they were never this vivid if I knew anything about lucid dreams I knew you could mind control things to make it work your way. Well that wasn’t the case here, I fell straight to the floor and blacked out. 

I was disappointed for the fact that I thought I really had this conjuring things in a Lucid dream down. 

Nope, a scene starts playing, my person woke up, all around me were nothing but horrific yellow walls, the floor was made of moldy yellowish coloring. Florescent lights dominated the ceiling all across the corridors. My person woke up groggily and starts making his way down the corridor. 

If there’s anything about my person in lucid dreams he would always follow the flow, no questions asked. He makes his way to the end of the corridor to find a bunch more corridors. I was kind of spooked. 

I realized I just had to pick a direction since I had no where else to go. My mom always said the right hand of the father was the correct hand to use. I’ve always thought about that statement as the right way is always the right away but I’ve decided to take the left all the time because I’ve always been the only child in my family to be sick of religion and it’s nonsense. 

I’ve been wandering aimlessly for who knows how long now, it was deafeningly quiet I hated it so bad, I tried to slide my feet with the carpet in hopes of not making any noises, I could literally hear my blood pressure pressuring. I took one more left to see the lights were now turnt off. 

My heart stopped. 

I thought maybe there was another way and so I turned back around and went the opposite way only to find that way was also dark. I started panicking, I couldn’t do this, I was going to have a panic attack. I tried to wake up myself up telling my self to wake up but with no luck. I was laying there chest heaving. I’m scared of the dark if there’s anything I hated the most it was the dark. 

I knew this was a dream yet I was so scared, I’d rather have died than to walk through a pitch black hallway. Knowing it was gonna be the only way out I got emotionally and mentally ready. I started walking, the hallway gets darker and darker. At this point I was holding on to the wall, heart about to burst from my chest. I felt like I couldn’t do it my brain got to the best of me there’s no way! 

I turned around and start running for my life back to the light only to see a figure standing there. It was the nun I’ve seen from that locket, only she had a knife in her hand, a river of blood falling from her eyes. At this point I’m numb, speechless, I felt like I could actually die and melt into the ground but burst into flames all at once. 

She didn’t move a muscle but stood there menacingly.

“God sent me here to send souls to heaven for him. I only did my do diligence.”

Horrified and speechless in the face my body tensed to the max. I was like a cat on the fence ready to move like a cheetah on my tippy toes. A felt a hand touched me on my shoulder from behind I screamed violently and jumped back to see a older looking man, grey hair and mustache with a red slash on his neck. 

“Run!” 

He said grabbing my hand and running me into the dark. I turn around while running to see the nun on my trail knife in the air ready to slash. At this point I wanted to vomit, the old man led me back into a place of light, 

“I’ve been studying this place for years.” He says as we struggle to run the the half lit up, narrow yellow corridors.

“Don’t fight it! God wants this for you!” 

She says as she is running at us with the speed of 10 horses. She’s too fast, she’s honing in on me. 

She goes in to slice at me once and yanked my arm forward with the old man still pulling at me. She goes in for a second slice this time I felt it tear my shirt that was flying back. I decided to concentrate at my running and pull at every fiber of muscle I can conjure into my calves to move even a inch away from her. 

The light goes out again and the man slams us around a dark corner, he puts a hand over my mouth and holds me there, I hear the nun shuffle around to find us. 

“This is gods will, come out and give me your soul.” 

Jesus Christ I’ve never been so scared in my entire life. 

I can hear her shuffle away from us, we waited for what felt like forever for her to leave eventually she did.

He takes my hand and treads lightly around a couple more dark corners until we got to a lit place again, in this corridor was a dead end and all there was, was a hole.

“Jump” he said

“Come with me!!!” I said 

“No I still have some work to do” 

“What?!?! Are you crazy we need to go-“ not letting me finish I hear a banshee screech from the dark corridor which made my body jump out of my skin. 

The man pushes me into the hole.

I wake up in my bed, its 10:07am, 
I come downstairs to see my mom making breakfast. 

“How was your night sweetie? My mom says putting pancakes in front of me. 

“It was horrible, I just had the worst nightmare.” I said chowing down.


“Maybe it was gods will”

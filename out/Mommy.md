Me and my mom were driving from Florida to Iowa like every other Christmas. We had been driving for 12 hours while one person would drive for an hour then stop and switch. “Oh! There’s the timer! Time to switch” my mom said with overwhelming excitement and tiredness. I was kinda ready to drive just a little tired. I set the timer and- *SLAM*

“mom?” I said

“What was that?” My mother said

We exchanged terrified looks. We looked in the back seat expecting to see a person in the back but we saw nothing out of the ordinary. We had the snacks, blankets, cooler for water, pillows, and luggage right where we left it all. Nice and neat. Well for a split second until we both tore it all apart looking for anyone. No one was there. Was it maybe a person on the outside? We didn’t know so I just put the petal to the metal. We probably got 70-80 miles away and- “awe shit!” We ran out of gas. We were just so lucky my dad had insisted we kept gas in the car at all times.

We filled up the car and head off. We were in some corn field in Kentucky. Only us for hours. Until 3 am. We had shaken the fear for the time being. Until through the fog was a person but they were so short. A kid! He looked confused so I rolled down my window and said “hey, do you need some help?” In a welcoming voice. He just stared at the ground

“hey do you need help?” I repeated in the Same tone. ever since my miscarriage I always treat kids extremely kind. All I wanted was to have a healthy baby boy and be the best mom ever.

The boy stoped staring at the ground and looked at me. “mommy? Mommy!” He yelled

“Oh I’m sorry I’m not your mommy”

“What do you mean? You had me 7 years ago then got rid of me.”

I was freaked out. How does he think I’m his mom? And he’s the same age as my Tyler would be right now.

“Mommy you forgot me? It’s Tyler silly!”

Ok that was creepy

“Whens your birthday?” I said freaked out

“May 7th!” Tyler replied 

That was my breaking point. Tyler’s due date was the 7th of may. I cried so much as I drove away.

“Mommy! You were going to leave me?!” Tyler said in a deep, dark voice. I screamed. He was in my car. I looked for my mom bust she was gone. “M-mom?!?” I cried out. Tyler said something so horrific to me that mad me scream for what felt like forever 

“If I can’t have my mommy then you can’t either!” As he giggled like a maniac.

As a matter of fact, I screamed so loud that I…


Woke up? I looked for my mom. oh thank god! She was in the drivers seat. We were still in Kentucky and the same corn field. But it was now 4:03. My mom then said 

“Oh! And I found a little boy and offers him a ride, he said his name was Tyler.”

I froze for a while then looked back. A familiar voice said 

“Mommy?”

My name is Scott Ruger I’m apart of an ATF task force based in Philadelphia PA. It was a cold October night around 9pm the year is 2009. I just got a call that we have to do a no knock warrant on a house in the middle of nowhere Appalachian Pennsylvania. On charges of possessing illegal machine guns. I get in my car and start heading to the station. It’s around 10 ish now I just got done with the debrief and what we have to do. I gear up and hop in the bearcat. 

the place we’re going is near Noxen which is filled with nothing but rednecks and hillbillies. The guy were after is named Mud Mcwall and is a Vietnam vet which has a confirmed kill count of 5. 

When I do search warrants I’m usually not to nervous but this one had me a little worried. Because you never know whether  A this guys going peacefully or B he’s gonna go batshit insane. And this guy strikes me as the type to chose option B

We finally start driving down this long dirt road. Now mind you me and my buddies are in the bearcat which is in the middle of 2 of Chevy Suburbans both front and back and 1 Ford Crown Vic also front and back. So in total 34 highly skilled agents. We got told that ETA is 2 minutes.

We load our M4’s my other buddy Zack is the only one to have Remington 870 which is a shotgun. Zack is my best friend he’s more like brother to me than anything I’ve know him since I was 3. I look at him and say “You ready to rock?” And he responded with “I was born ready!” 

We come around a bend to what l say wasn’t even a house it looked more like Jason’s shack in Friday The 13th part 2. 

I go “What the fuck.” it looked like there was nobody there, I radio to our head guy. “Are you sure we are at the place.” He says. “This is the place.” We get out and start searching  for this guy.

Everybody started splitting into pairs of 2 Zack and me were told to search the left side of the shack. There was a group of 4 that was clearing the house. Anyway we start looking. There was at least 20 old cars rotting. I’m using my flashlight on my rifle and Zack was using his on his shotgun. But there was one car that stood out. A rotted and rusted out ‘62 Cadillac Fleetwood limo that was a redneck special. we searched it 

And there was something that I didn’t even expect. A body, it was mutilated. The limbs looked like they were chopped off. Including the head I couldn’t even tell what gender it was. There was a hole in the chest as if it was ripped out by hands. It made so sick to point I puked. I couldn’t even describe the smell. But before I could say anything the bearcat exploded. Both of the suburbans were lit on fire. 
 
I turned around and that’s when I heard what sounded like a banjo playing very slowly and the same riff. I turned to my left 
And that’s when I saw the biggest most inbred redneck ever. Mind you I’m a 6 foot 175 pound guy. This guy had to be at least 6 foot nine and 400 pounds of pure muscle. 

I said “put your hands up!” And that’s when all hell broke out. It sounded like an active war zone, explosions multiple shots from machine guns mind you we we’re only armed with semi auto rifles. 

Zack shot the first guy we saw but the 12 gauge didn’t even affect him he started running Zack shot again no affect. He shot another time this time aiming at his leg which only dropped him but he was still crawling and screaming the flashlight made him look like one of the monsters from the Evil Dead. 

In fact none of these hillbilly fucks looked human. They all looked dead they all looked like they drank blood but not vampires. The closest I can describe it to is that they looked like the monsters off the first three Cannibal Corpse albums. That’s when I saw a smaller tweaker looking kind of guy starting to eat one of the other agents. That cleared the house and ran back outside. 

I put two rounds in his back but the fucker didn’t even flinch. He just kept eating this guy alive. I look over at Zack and he’s just shooting whatever’s near the house that isn’t one of our agents. Then that’s when I see a fucking tree branch go right through his. The first guy we saw got up and stabbed him. I forgot that fucker was still alive The more that I saw of its face it kind of looked like Jason Voorhees meets Hills Have Eyes. 

I put three rounds to his chest one in his head and that’s when he dropped dead. I turned back around to see one of these hillbillies wielding an M-16 and shooting fully automatic I see him shoot and kill two of my agents. I see another one of my agents being burned alive from the cars and then being beaten with a hammer. It looked as if it was hell on earth. 

I got up and started running and then out of nowhere I heard someone yell in front of me “where you going city slicker?” I dropped to the ground because of the pain I felt and when I looked at my kneecap there was a bolt from a crossbow. Then I looked in front of me to see another one of those huge hellbilly but not as tall and not as muscular. I pulled out my Glock 19M and unloaded five rounds into his stomach

It didn’t matter though. He didn’t stop running, my Glock stove piped. it was too late. Everything went black

I think I was in the basement of the shack. I looked to my left to see my Captain being skined alive and Zacks corpse being eating. One of the agents getting scalped. I felt light headed and my blood was being dripped out of my leg and into a bucket. Which I don’t even wanna know what it was being used for. The guy that was skinning my captain and the other that was scalping my agent both went upstairs. 

I saw this as a chance to run. I undid myself from the doctors table and saw the cellar door. I barged right through it I looked around to the front all the cars were burned. Then I saw the Cadillac limousine. I open the door and the keys were in ignition. I slammed the car door locked it and tried turning it on but it wouldn’t budge. I tried two more times and it finally started just as soon as these hillbillies started running out the cellar door. One was holding an M 14 the other a baseball bat.

The words can’t even describe how relieved and thankful I was for surviving I looked down at my watch and so I was 3:30AM I didn’t find Mud Mcall. I went to nearest hospital. I said everything. 2 days later in the hospital bed I’m watching the news. I was the only one who survived but nobody could fined who committed the massacre.

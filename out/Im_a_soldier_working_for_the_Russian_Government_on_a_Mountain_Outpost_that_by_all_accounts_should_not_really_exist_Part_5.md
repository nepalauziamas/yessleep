For a long, grim moment I am stuck fast with shock.

As Kristian shambles his way through the corridor towards me, several of his shadows are cast out in impossible directions. They flicker and jolt with his movements, and he opens his mouth, to speak.

The spell is broken and I take a hasty retreating step. “K-Kristian-”

Like a sudden sword in the darkness, from seemingly out of nowhere, appears *Elena*. She throws out a hand and stands in front of me, tall and defiant. “Idiot..” she mutters to me, shooting me a quick, cold glance. “Do not engage verbally with *Enemy*”.

“The Enemy?” I whisper in reply, as Elena raises her rifle. The silvery light of the morning catches in her hair, and reflects in the dark, void-like pools of Kristian’s eyes.

Kristian’s jaw falls open, and a myriad of conflicting voices pour out, slithering through the air, the sounds serpentine.

*“Adam, don’t let her hurt* ***me".***

*“We aren’t so different, you and* ***I***".

*“They lie below. Let* ***us*** *return to them”.*

*“ADAM! DON’T STAND IN* ***MY*** *WAY!”*

A loud, sharp shot rings loud and painful down the corridor. I catch a flicker of recoil. Elena’s weapon jumps up ever so slightly, and with a flash, Kristian drops like a stone to the ground.

“What the FUCK?” I hear Charlie shout above the ringing in my ears, and then he appears beside me from an off-shooting corridor, watching in alarm as Kristian strikes the floor.

The man lands into line with the window. The first rays of the day’s light fall across his skin.

“E-Elena”, he mutters, writhing on the floor, blood leaking and pooling out beneath him. “I- I can’t see-”

And a second later, the man starts to steam. The process takes literally seconds. One minute he is there, whole… and the next, his mass begins to drift away in the form of thick, dark smoke. It sticks to the walls like tar and condenses on the ceiling, and all that remains behind is a blackened, charred skeleton.

Ash, blood, and a thick, viscous semi-solid, connecting it all with unsightly strands of inhuman gristle.

&#x200B;

We stand there in horrified silence, Charlie and I. And beside us, Elena. Like a statue.

&#x200B;

The ringing echoes in my ears, and I turn to her. To this mystery that shot down the demon, and I notice that she has started trembling. Ever so slightly, almost imperceptibly, but she shivers nonetheless.

She swivels on the spot and marches away, shoving me to the side as she does so, and I catch the briefest glimpse of tears streaming down the sides of her cheeks.

She disappears round a corner, leaving the Englishman and I in the corridor.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Alone, with Kristian’s remains.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Charlie retches.

&#x200B;

Then he turns away.

&#x200B;

“I’m sorry mate…” he murmurs under his breath, then he passes me by. “We’ll deal with this later, Adam”, he says bitterly. “Just go to bed. Get some sleep”.

*Get some sleep*, he says, as I try, and fail, to comprehend this horror.

*Kristian…*

*Is that it? Is he dead? Just like that?*

*Unless…*

“Charlie!” I shout out, turning to look the way he went. “That was a copy, right? A demon clone, or whatever? Tell me that thing was Kristian’s copy? That wasn’t Kristian, right?”

…But Charlie does not reply, and I do not go after him.

I look for one final time that morning at the smouldering remains in the corridor’s centre, and then, with a grunt of frustrated anguish, I pass it by. Carefully sidestepping and walking to my room.

*Don’t think about it Don’t think about it. Just do as Charlie said. Get some sleep Rest. Recuperate. Sleep, Adam.*

And somehow, I do. I crash into bed, and the dreams and nightmares blur sickeningly with my reality. They are disjointed and chaotic, and in my head I hear them speak to me. The demons. Begging and pleading with me to allow them entry to the Outpost.

…And amongst their voices, is Kristian’s.

&#x200B;

\*

&#x200B;

I awaken to the sound of shouting.

I groan and turn to my side, the light from my window suddenly intense across my eyes.

“Kristian…” I mutter, still half-asleep, as the shouting becomes clearer.

I can’t understand what’s being said. It’s all in Russian. Elena and Yuri, by the sounds of it.

I sigh, and draw myself up and out of bed. There’s work to be done.

I follow my routine, regimental, and the shouting only goes on and on as I do so. It does not falter until I enter the hexagon room, eyes still bleary, head still pounding. Elena is right up in Yuri’s space, though she leaves him be and marches right up to me upon my arrival. Yuri sighs and slumps down into a seat, fumbling for a cigarette, but Elena jabs a finger into my face. Her arctic eyes bore into mine, her scar pulled grotesquely as she snarls at me.

“Understand impact of your actions”, she hisses. “Your idiocy has cost Kristian his life. He was a good man. He was an idiot like you, but he was a good man. He deserved better. So much better”. Her focus flickers from my left eye to my right, and back. It’s deeply unnerving. I don’t even know what to say.

&#x200B;

*…So that confirms it for sure then. Kristian is dead.*

&#x200B;

“What-” I begin quietly. “What do we do now?”

“Now we wait. Charlie has dealt with Kristian bones. I have gotten radio through to command. Urgent backup requested, but who knows when they will arrive. Two days? Three days? More? We will face very hard conditions tonight. And next nights. The Outpost needs *six*. Five is sub-optimal. We will struggle to defend. And it is your fault”. Her lips pull back from her teeth in a dark sneer, and she turns, points to Yuri as well. “Your fault also!” Then she shouts out a string of obscenities in Russian. Yuri doesn’t even look over. He just lights up his cig and takes a drag.

Elena raises her hand and I flinch, but she only points behind me, back down the corridor. “Go relieve April from the tower. That is where you will be stationed today. April will fill you in on what to do. Small tip: don’t get drunk and fuck it up”. She shakes her head. “*Amerikanets”.* And then she simply strides away, leaving me to wallow in my guilt.

I run a hand through my hair, as gentle snowflakes fall beyond the glass, flittering down into the rocky gorge beyond. “You good, Yuri?” I ask the man.

He stares out the window. He makes no noise or gesture in response, and I let out a sigh. Guess I’d better go take over from April, then. She sure missed quite the night.

I head through the complex and past the site of Kristian’s demise.

I pause there, for a moment.

&#x200B;

The floor is stained, and there are residual marks and splatters of an inky-like substance in the window frames and in the ceiling’s corners… But it looks like Charlie cleaned the bulk of the mess up himself.

&#x200B;

I swallow.

“I’m sorry, man”, I murmur into the dreadful silence. “I’m so, so sorry”, then I turn away, and continue down the corridor.

The exit that will lead me to the courtyard, and the tower beyond is just ahead, but as I approach the complex’s rough centre, a voice calls out to me. Charlie’s

“Hey”, he says, and I stop, turning to the voice’s source.

“Yeah?”

He peers at me from around a doorway. There is no mischievous grin this time. No foolish shaking of a vodka bottle. Just exhausted, bloodshot eyes. A grim face. He gestures for me to come over, and I do so.

Following him into the room, he nods down to the ground by our feet.

I don’t know what this room is used for. Wooden flooring, a low stage, there are some chairs stacked up by the walls… Could be a meeting hall of some sort. But all that’s irrelevant, really, as the object of interest is quite obvious.

In the middle of the room is an ugly, roughly human-sized hole in the ground. The boards and planks have been torn up and ripped, the floor around it is covered in scratches, and rock and concrete have been cracked and chipped below. Some granules of the stuffs have been scattered about the floor.

“The hell happened here?” I ask, murmuring.

Charlie gestures to the hole. “Some cunt’s been in here. Trying to get down”. He crouches and runs a hand over the splintered wood. The clawmarks, by the look of them. He turns to me. “The demon was in here. And it decided that this was a good place to start digging”.

“It doesn’t look like it got very far”. The hole is noticeable, but it hasn’t gotten that deep, to be honest. Maybe about four feet or so. I sigh and rub my forehead. “Charlie, just tell it to me straight, man. What else do I need to know about this place? No secrets, no hiding stuff. Just tell me”.

He stands up and brushes the dust from his knees. “The Outpost has always been staffed. Always. Russians do two months, outsiders do less. I don’t like that. I wanted to stay and beat Yuri’s record”. He rubs his nose. “Elena, I don’t know. She never talks. Yuri might know more. But I swear she’s been here for years. I don’t know why. Can’t imagine why someone would want to live in a shithole like this. Maybe she’s been ordered to stay. Punishment for something. Maybe for whatever got her that scar, I don’t know”. He shrugs. He kicks some of the dust across the floor. “Demons. We fight demons. I’m not convinced that that’s what they are, to tell the truth, but since religious stuff seems to work against them it’s a good a guess as any”.

“But not ALL religious stuff, right? Kristian”, I pause as I mention his name, involuntarily. “Kristian told me about a guy who was here before us. Sikh, I think? Didn’t believe in any of it. He said that the demons were different”.

“Yeah. That’s right. I wasn’t here for it, obviously, but I’ve heard of the incident. Don’t know what happened to the guy in the end, he just vanished… But the demons… Kristian said that when the Sikh was on duty, the demons often took the forms of shapes”.

“Shapes?”

“Aye. Spheres, cubes, cones, weird shit like that. He said they all shared a vision, of an endless rain of coins across the mountains. That the Outpost was smothered in it. Drowned in it, drowned in metal… and then the next thing they knew the vision passed”.

“Who was this?”

“Kristian was there with Elena, and four others. No clue who they might have been. Similar group to ourselves, I should think”.

I shake my head. “I still don’t get it. Why only six? Why six people? It’s like the basis of a ritual, or something”.

“A ritual? I don’t know, mate…”

“Just a guess”. I sigh.

“I don’t think it’s anything like that. I think that it’s more to do with the fact that we don’t want to broadcast our location. Too many warm bodies in the water…”

“Don’t want to broadcast our location?” I laugh, drily. “The Outpost has a TOWER. Have you seen the GUN on the roof of the building?”

Charlie shakes his head. “I don’t mean like that.  The demons don’t care about any of that shit. It’s *us lot* that interests them. The humans. With our human fears and thoughts. They think that they can use us. They can use us to get inside the Outpost”.

“To get inside the Outpost…” I echo. “And why in God’s name would they want to get in here?”

Charlie shrugs again. “Well, that’s the question, ain’t it”. He glances to his watch. “You’re on tower duty, right?”

I nod.

He nods in return. “You’d better get off there then. Before Elena gives you a bollocking. But first, take a look at this. A little clue for our burning question”. He gestures to the hole. “Take a look down there”.

I glance down into it. “There’s nothing there, Charlie. It’s not even that deep-”

He shakes his head, interrupts me. “No. Get right down, and press your face against the concrete. There’s a tiny, tiny little keyhole-sized crack in the rock beneath it. Really look”.

Cautiously, I do so.

I cannot see the hole to which he refers at first, and I grunt and wince as the dust blows about my face. I feel like an idiot, with my head and shoulders down this hole in the middle of the floor, but at last I see what Charlie is referring to. “This it?”

“Yes”, he replies, and he passes me a small flashlight. “There’s another chip in the rock to your left, a little narrower. You see that? Press the flashlight against it, then look down the hole below. And tell me what you see”.

I take the light from him and do as he says, closing one eye, and pressing the other up close to the little crack. The glow is feeble, and it takes my vision a moment to adjust… But…

…But yes… I think I can actually see something.

&#x200B;

Or the edges of something. *Somethings*, I should say.

&#x200B;

“What the hell are those?” I murmur.

“Beats me”, I hear Charlie reply. “But there’s something down there, alright. And I’m guessing that that’s what the demon wanted. What they all want, perhaps”.

I squint a little harder.

It’s difficult to explain what I can see, but I’ll try.

Way, way down there in the darkness below me, the faint shimmer from the flashlight through the hole illuminates the very edges of a series of repeated, uniform shapes. It’s difficult to gauge their size, as I don’t know how far down they are, but at a guess I’d say they were no smaller than myself. The things appear to be stacked in rows. I can only see the very edges of the tops of these things, but they descend down into the murky darkness beneath.

&#x200B;

*What are they, godamnit? What are they?*

*…*

*Agh. I can’t see well enough.*

&#x200B;

I draw back, coughing with a sudden inhalation of dust. “Any theories?”

Charlie shakes his head. “Not a clue. We’ll ask Elena when she’s cooled down a little”.

I grimace. “When she’s cooled down..? Charlie, I don’t know the intricacies of their relationships all that well, but it seems to me like Elena just lost a pretty close friend last night. And let’s face it, it’s largely our fault. Yuri’s too, sure, but all of our faults nonetheless. If you’re waiting for her to ‘cool down’, you might be waiting a long fucking time”.

Charlie considers my words. He clenches his teeth and stares off into space, but says nothing further. He looks away and strides off down the corridor, his head down.

I think about calling after him, but there’s no use, really. I just stand back up, and continue my little journey. April’s waiting for me.

Tower duty time, I suppose.

&#x200B;

…

&#x200B;

I cross the courtyard as flakes of snow drift lazily down to the gravel that crunches beneath my feet.

I pass by the ruins of the water-tower, and head for the tower still standing. The one at the very edge of the cliff, looking out far across the mountains. I’m still yet to actually step foot inside it.

I clamber up some concrete steps and slide my way through the tower’s door.

&#x200B;

*Rule Five*, I hear in Kristian’s voice. *We must keep a constant presence in the tower.*

&#x200B;

I see in my mind the crinkles of his eyes as he smiles, and I grimace, blurring the image away.

The interior is dark and gloomy. I’d have expected nothing less. But my eyes are instantly drawn to the great, framed painting hung on the wall opposite.

It has been painted in shades of brown, of gray, of white, and of gold. It depicts a woman in the midst of a windstorm. Her robes blow about her shoulders, and she stares fiercely out at something unseen, just above the painter’s point of view. She has in her hand a shining silver cross, and she stands defiant as the snow is whipped about her being.

I glance down to the little plaque nailed into the varnished wood at the painting’s base.

There is a small line of text in Cyrillic, but her name is given as: ‘Olga, of the Rus; Olga, of Kiev’.

Beside it on the wall is a small passage scrawled with chalk, in French, and then, another passage below scrawled in English. I’m no linguist, but I would guess that they probably say the same thing. The English passage has a number of words crossed out:

&#x200B;

‘Olga’s Tower. For her sacrifice. For the ~~anchoring~~ (?) ~~anchor~~, Tethering (?), and the Walls. 899-969AD’.

&#x200B;

Hmm.

&#x200B;

I consider this, with one last parting look up into Olga’s eyes, her expression fixed, yet alive with passion… and I continue on along my way. Up the ascending stairs that line the inner walls of the tower. They carry me up about half way, and plastered across these walls are a number of things of vague interest. Crude chalk doodle; some infographics in Russian… There are schematics of the tower itself, and of that enormous gun on the Outpost’s roof… and one very realistic, very disturbing sketch of a demon, clambering up the tower wall right beside me.

The stairs come to a stop on a floor with a modest, crappy bathroom, one lined with leaking pipes, and beside the door to this bathroom is a steel ladder. One which will presumably carry me up to the very top.

With a sigh, I continue my climb. My boots rattling and echoing against the rungs.

The ladder leads me to a little platform that encircles the inner walls, and I cross over to another. Another ladder, I mean. This is the one that finally carries me up to the top. The highest room, with a vantage over all beneath it.

&#x200B;

Grunting, my head breaches the floor-level of the uppermost room, and at last I find April, huddled up against the wall.

&#x200B;

She stares at me with dark-shadowed eyes, and we regard each other, her against the wall, and I, paused at the top of the ladder.

“…Is it true then, Adam?” she asks quietly. “Is Kristian dead?”

I glance to her right.

There sits her radio. A little light on the side flickers in and out of focus. I guess she got it working, to a degree. Or someone else has been up here to visit her.

&#x200B;

*A visitor..? With such a climb? Not damned likely.*

&#x200B;

“…Yeah”, I mutter guiltily. “Yeah, Kristian is dead. A demon got him”.

April says nothing. She just brings a hand up to her eyes and allows herself some silent sobs, her shoulders shaking as she turns away.

I find myself struck with a rush of sudden, unprocessed emotion of my own, and I complete my climb, slumping down against the wall opposite and looking into my hands. Slowly opening and closing my scratched, scarred fingers as the wind blows beyond the walls.

&#x200B;

“How did it happen?” April asks me after a while.

&#x200B;

I sigh and rub my hands across my face, inadvertently smearing myself with grime from the ladder as I do so. “I don’t know, really. He was possessed. I saw him, I called out to him… I think he heard me as he started walking towards me. Or, the demon did, I guess. And then…” I pause. “Elena shot him. He fell into the light and- and that was it. He was gone”.

*‘Elena… I- I can’t see…’*

I swallow. I don’t share his final words with April.

“Fucking hell”, she says, shaking her head. “Shit”. She stands up and clenches her fists, then heads to the ladder, and begins to climb her way down.

“Hey!” I say, “wait, what am I supposed to do here?”

“Just check the lines of sights. Two of the weapons in here are the same as the others, but the large one has more of a kick, so be careful. I gotta go. Enjoy. There’s ration boxes in that corner. Someone will relieve you tomorrow. Does your radio work? Do you have it on you?”

“I- yes, I have it-”

“Good”, she says, just before her head disappears from sight below the floor. “See you”.

And away she goes, the ladder shaking as she clambers down the rungs.

I fumble for words for a second, and then just let them go with a sigh.

*Fine. Use the weapons. Follow the lines of sight.*

Seems simple enough, I guess. Fuck it.

&#x200B;

I grunt as I get to my feet, and I walk the length of the room. There are several vantage points, and the wind blows through them and into the room. It is cold, and it is miserable.

The three weapons are all equidistant, and they provide lines of sight way down to the courtyard below… to the outer wall of the complex, and the snow and the mountains and the rockscape beyond.

I study these weapons.

Two of them are essentially exact copies of the weapons I’ve been using so far, stationed around the Outpost’s roof, but the third looks more like a modified *Javelin*. I peer around it. The barrel splits into four at the end; and I give the weapon a shake, the mechanisms clanking as it judders from side to side. I peer through the sights and flick between two fields of view. A wide range of the landscape below, and a closer, narrower field a little more zoomed in.

“Well doesn’t this look fun”, I murmur, glancing at my watch.

Still got a few hours to kill before nightfall.

&#x200B;

…My anxiety spikes.

&#x200B;

*…Nightfall.*

*The living nightmare.*

*…And we are a man down.*

&#x200B;

Memories of the previous night flash through my head. Considered in the cold light of day. I see myself, lips cracked and bleeding. Eyes wide and burnt with streaks of weapon-flash as the demons scramble up the walls. I see Yuri tumbling over the edge. I feel a second-hand strain across my upper-body and I see Kristian crashing down to the floor and bursting into billowing smoke.

I close my eyes and just take a moment to recover.

*Calm. Calm down. No more deaths. No more. Just focus. Focus, Adam.*

I take a deep breath of cold, mountain air.

“…Alright”.

&#x200B;

\*

&#x200B;

I kill the time by doing stretches. By sorting through the ration boxes and making myself a cold, grim meal. I ensure my water bottles are full and stationed in places for quick access, if needs be. And I read the Bible that has been stashed up here.

I flick through the pages, and find a passage in Psalms that has been circled several times in pencil. I read it aloud to myself in a quiet voice, as the breeze blows beyond the walls of the tower.

*“He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High will abide in the shadow of the Almighty... I will say to the Lord, "My refuge and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust." For he will deliver you from the snare of the fowler and from the deadly pestilence. He will cover you with his pinions, and under his wings you will find refuge; his faithfulness is a shield and buckler. You will not fear the terror of the night, nor the arrow that flies by day."*

I do not know what ‘pinions’ are, but a little annotation made beside the word reads: ‘feathers. The feathers of God’s wings’. A cold chill ripples up my spine, and I turn the page. I wonder briefly who made the annotation. April, a few hours ago?

...Or someone else, perhaps. Someone stationed in this tower fifty years ago, maybe. Or more. Sixty. Seventy. One hundred?

&#x200B;

The shadows deepen as the sun sinks low.

&#x200B;

*It won’t be long now.*

&#x200B;

My radio crackles, the unexpected noise breaking my train of thought and making me jump.

“Nightfall soon lads”, comes Charlie’s voice. He sounds worn. “Stations”. I think he says something else too, but the radio becomes fuzzy with static, and I miss it.

I crack my knuckles and head to the weapon that looks out and away from the Outpost.

The view from here really is staggering. The tips of the mountains disappear way off towards the horizon, and the white of the snow caps glint with amber and orange as the sun drops lower and lower.

A bead of sweat buds on my forehead. Another follows, and then, another. I wipe them away with my sleeve.

This is the worst part, I’ve decided. This anticipation. This waiting. The gnawing, grinding anxiety. The trembling in my hands; cracked and callused. Yet to be warmed by exertion and adrenaline my sweat is slick and grim and icy. I wipe my palms on the sides of my uniform, and then minutes later feel the need to do so again.

The sun disappears behind the mountains, and the last of the day’s light begins to steadily trickle away.

The clouds darken overhead, and the shadows begin to merge across the ground.

&#x200B;

…

&#x200B;

An hour goes by.

A long, cold hour.

&#x200B;

Elena comes through on the radio twice to ensure that we are all focused and in position.

&#x200B;

And at last, the tension spikes before its break, as the song begins to jump between the distant, icy peaks towards us.

The song is as discordant as it was the previous night. Worse, even. The melody is almost entirely gone. A wail, a broken chorus… I swallow, my throat already dry, and I reach out for the nearest bottle of water, taking a quick, clumsy swig.

I drop it in fright as a voice whispers clear and cold right into my ear from behind:

*“Adam. You are fewer. No more need to be taken. Allow* ***us*** *ENTRY”.*

I spin around to face the voice’s source, but the tower room remains empty. The Bible is open where I left it, and a breeze sends a few of the thin pages flickering from cover to cover.

The song grows sharper, the voices clamoring against and top of each other… and the demons begin to appear in the distance.

Dozens of them. Dark, shadowy shapes rippling and scrambling through the cracks and crevices in the mountains towards the Outpost. Their arms moving at such a speed as to give them the appearance of spiders, scuttling over the dark, snow-lined rocks.

I grab the radio and shout into it: “North-West, demons approaching! Dozens of them! Be ready!” I reach for the weapon. The metal is cold against my hands as I clank it up and into position, and, deliberately conscious of the silver cross resting against my chest, I fire the first beam. Flicking it out into an arc and feeling a warm burst of recoil as the light thunders down like curved lightning into the darkness.

It tears through three and sends a fourth into a shower of dust.

*There’s so many… How are we supposed to fight against such a tide?*

*“Why are you doing this, Adam?”* asks the voice of a demon in my left ear. A female voice, though not one that I recognize.  ***"We*** *don’t want to hurt you or the others. Please, will you just stand down?”*

“No”, I mutter through clenched teeth, my voice grim in its defiance.

&#x200B;

…And in that very same instant, the demons in the mountains below me promptly change direction.

…All of them.

Where once they were set to stream right past towards the Outpost-proper, they have now diverted their routes instead, to me.

…To the *tower*.

To my left, and in the corner of my eye, I think for a second that I see the source of the voice. A woman of ever-spilling, cascading, water-like shadow. Her eyes two pinprick of glowing embers… I shout out loud in terror and scramble away from the weapon, turning to face her…

…But she is gone.

&#x200B;

I am alone.

&#x200B;

The Bible flickers through another page, and I hear Kristian’s words in my head in his thick Norwegian accent:

*‘Rule Two, do not engage verbally with the Enemy’.*

I hear that same phrase again, this time in Elena’s voice.

*“Idiot. Do not engage verbally with Enemy”.*

My blood freezes in my veins. I jump to the weapon and peer through the sights, as the demons scuttle their way towards the tower’s position from all directions.

*Fuck, oh, FUCK, Adam, what have you done NOW you IDIOT?*

“…*And why not, Adam?”* comes the voice of the demon. She sounds a little more ‘solid’, now. Less ethereal. I can almost see her, or some sick apparition of her in the edges of my vision… But every time I turn to look, she vanishes. *“Are you afraid of ending up like Kristian?* ***I*** *am sorry for that. Truly,* ***I*** *am so, so sorry. But* ***we*** *were getting desperate.* ***We*** *needed him”.*

*Why?* I want to ask, but I bite my damned tongue and turn away, returning to the weapon and firing bright, beam-like blasts out into the icy darkness below. The courtyard and the Outpost itself are illuminated with firework-like flames as my comrades face their own battles.

I stretch and reach out a hand for my radio, shouting into it again, ignoring the whispering in my ear. “MORE FIREPOWER ON THE TOWER SIDE OF THE OUTPOST! URGENT!” I shout as the erratic device crackles and fizzles.

&#x200B;

*I’m not cut out for this, clearly. Maybe Elena was right. I just can’t seem to stop fucking up, at every opportunity…*

&#x200B;

I clench my jaw and murmur the Bible verse as I send out the screaming blasts of weaponized light, my hands tight on the machinery.

“My refuge, and my fortress….” I see myself in the top of the tower, a beacon in the darkness as the froth and surge of the demons below grow stronger and stronger. “My God, in whom I trust…”

*Please, ‘God’… Whatever, wherever you are… Just save us. Save us from the darkness.*

My eyes widen and my eyebrows furrow with a burst of brutal, fiery determination, a sudden surge through my shoulders and down my spine. “FOR HE WILL DELIVER ME FROM THE SNARE OF THE FOWLER AND THE DEADLY PESTILENCE! I WILL NOT FEAR THE TERROR OF THE **NIGHT**, NOR THE ARROW THAT FLIES BY **DAY!”**

I cast away the demon that slithers around the tower and my hair is blown back from my face as the light spirals down and around across the courtyard and the rocky drops of the mountains. The demons are burst into clattering, smoking bones as their cries of anguish become one with the taunting, inharmonious song across the range.

The battle goes on. On and on it goes as the night stretches out and away.

And the demons just keep coming. The endless, shadowy spiders far below.

The lights flash in a man-made storm. The snow falls. I take to the third weapon, the larger piece with the split barrel- and with a judder through my bones and a rumble through the walls, I watch as four, glass-like spheres of intensely glowing light are released from the end… they tumble and drop like stones over the side of the tower, falling for a second, for two…

...And then they alight like fire. Screaming out in the direction they were aimed. Spreading and splitting apart further, then further, a rain of light across the gorge.

And all the while, a darkness grows in the mountains opposite. Steadily increasing as the hours pass, amassing, writhing…

…It reminds me of that curious, twisted circle from the other night… but this is no abstract shape. You have to focus to really see it… but the shadows are formed in the shape of a *man*. Hunched over and huddled against the mountain. Whenever my focus is elsewhere, I could swear that I see two, mist-like eyes, watching me from afar… But as is typical with these things, whenever I turn to look directly at it, the image is lost. It becomes just another rough shadow between the peaks.

A voice comes screaming through the radio. April’s, by the sounds of it.

“….. ADAM! ….. TOWER!” is all I am able to catch through the crackling static.

I grab the device and shout back down it. “What? What did you say? What is it?”

But nothing further comes through. The device cuts out.

&#x200B;

I run from weapon to weapon, checking all the sights, looking in all directions… But I do not know why April called me. The tide of demons continues, but…

…But then I see it. Out there in the mountains. The gathering, man-shaped shadow… The colossus in the night, it is slowly, unsteadily rising to a stand. One formless, smoke-like hand rests on the mountain. It looks at me.

Right at me.

And I see it.

I see its eyes.

And again the tide converges.

My hands freeze on the weapon.

I cannot move, I cannot fire.

My heart pounds, and like a slingshot from the void, a long, dark shape rockets towards my position.

It strikes the side of the tower, and dust rains down from the roof.

I watch as the demons flow towards me, and I hear the sound of a terrible, almighty crack, like thunder in the darkness.

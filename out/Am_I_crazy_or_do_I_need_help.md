Every night is the same struggle I’m tired of it, hours it takes too sleep yet I wake up as if I never slept, with random pains as if I was an old man, but the dreams are the worst, nightmares of huge monsters chasing me, or simply the fear of being seen by monsters unseen by human eyes, ends of worlds by unknown figures or simply, betrayal, broken trust, past friendships, I (14m) am tired of this, 

The first one I remember started when I was 8, I thought I was awake but I walked out of my room and started going to the bathroom, this was my old house, bathroom only a few steps away yet it took an eternity, I awoke, covered in sweat yet freezing, I went back too sleep yet, I felt eyes on me, me and my sister shared a room but she was working, she worked early in the morning, I felt eyes, I silently cried hoping it would stop, hoping it wouldn’t get me,

I woke up in the morning, it was bright and I heard birds chirping, I never told a soul about it, the scariest one I remember, I was 11, it was late and I was watching tv, all of the sudden the closet door creaked open, immediately I covered myself with blankets and prayed to god, the closet door creaked again and I had too look, I looked and it was no longer my room, it was a all red room, it looked like my room but red, and no closet, I got up and went too the door, I heard voices, and assumed it was my parents, 

It was their headless bodies conversing as if nothing had happened, I saw their heads, with a look of horror on their lifeless faces, I was as quiet as I could be, but their bodies turned too see me, and started running, I cried and ran, I ran outside and ran too a pond by my house, was I safe, I heard a car and I started waving, the car swerved and started towards me, I ran and ran and ran until I couldn’t, then my whole family, headless, surrounds me, “you’ll never escape gods fate for you (my name), he has worse plans for you.” 

I managed too convince myself recently that my dreams maybe were portals too other worlds and dimensions, my mind seemed too take it and run because I have had too many dreams Similar too that one, I’m convinced I can go to the back rooms, an endless place with a yellowish glow, i was killed their multiple times and now I think it’s safe to say, this is all written from a dream, I can’t escape it anymore, please, send help, god has not been kind and I wish too get these nails out of my head, this pole out of my stomach, if I never post here again, I have not escaped, 

Fair well all, I hear it coming, may god save you with abilities such as me, this fate awaits you too,

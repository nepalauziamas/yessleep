  

Though I call it a cave, it isn’t much of one. It is more of a cavernous opening that stretches maybe ten feet back from the entrance and is very narrow inside. You may be wondering where I live. Well, my wife and I live in a very hilly part of rural Pennsylvania, and we own just barely three acres. Our house is on a main road and the backyard is only a downward slope into a forest like vegetation. Going east past the trees you will find a barbed wire fence almost immediately, which is the border to our neighbor’s property.

&#x200B;

Westbound however, is where our land stretches out for the few acres we have. If you go south-west, you will find this rocky formation, which houses the cave I mentioned. I think we noticed it the first week here while we scoured the property, excited at it’s mysteriousness. I remember using my phone as a flashlight as we peered into the dark crevice, disappointed to see there wasn’t much there.

&#x200B;

Since then, we’ve often walked by the cave at the bottom of the giant rock that borders properties beyond ours. Sometimes when we were drunk, we would often try and scare each other in the darkness that surrounded us, and it was always my wife who wanted to turn around first. I can’t deny I was always a little bit uneasy at times, but who isn’t in a pitch-dark army of trees. 

&#x200B;

The light of our house would always guide us back safely. It seemed like an endless darkness until we would turn around and see the lights behind us and remember we were just in our backyard. I loved these nights, and I would begin to venture out in the daytime by myself. The forest was completely different during the hours the sun was out. There was the same peacefulness, but a different kind of mystery. 

&#x200B;

Today, I made my way through the dense tree line and started my usual decent down the hill westward. Upon first sight of the cave, I could see a light emanating from inside. At first, I thought it might have been the twilight reflecting off the rock, but the sun seemed to already be behind the hill and trees. 

&#x200B;

Out of blind curiosity I approached the entrance and sure enough, there was a flickering light coming from inside of the cave. I contemplated turning around and going back up the hill to the house, but I also wanted to see what the cause was. 

&#x200B;

It looked like firelight, but I didn’t smell or see smoke. I was probably five feet away from the entrance now and I had an instinct to text my wife who was at work at this time. It felt weird, but at the same time, I felt like I would want her to do the same. So, I pulled out my phone and quickly typed. 

&#x200B;

“There’s light in the cave, looks like a fire. Hopefully nothing serious, maybe a squatter. Gonna take a look, I’ll let you know in a bit.”

 

I put my phone in my pocket and started to creep forwards, not wanting to make a sound. I wasn’t armed but I wished I was. I knew there was someone in there and I was right. 

&#x200B;

As I got close to the entrance, I heard a voice.

&#x200B;

”Come in, please. I beg of you.”

&#x200B;

I froze. I hadn’t made a sound or shown myself. How did this person know I was there. Their voice sounded crackly and old.

&#x200B;

“This is my property! Whoever you are please come out and leave peacefully, I don’t care who you are or what your reason for being here is, but I can’t have you in there. I will call the authorities if I have to!” 

&#x200B;

I thought I sounded stern, then the voice answered back. 

&#x200B;

“Oh honey, I told you to come in. Why are you being so rude? I can show you that this is a place of welcoming. A place of trust. Please, won’t you show yourself to me?” 

&#x200B;

I was stunned, this person was crazy. I pulled out my phone and began dialing 911. 

&#x200B;

“Oh, you don’t want to do that sweetheart, by the time anyone gets here, I’ll have never been here.” 

&#x200B;

At this point I was stone cold, I couldn’t go through with the call. How was this person in my mind? Why were they here and what did they want? 

&#x200B;

*Fuck this*

&#x200B;

“You better get the fuck out of there before I drag you-“ 

&#x200B;

Then she emerged, a woman seemingly bent in half, almost crawling on all fours but walking on her feet. Clad in a robe or maybe a large coat. It was black and almost ripped to shreds but still somehow covered her. Slowly but surely, she was making her way towards me. I was still standing there paralyzed. I was nauseous but I couldn’t move. I saw the long grayish black strands of her hair dragging on the ground as she paced in slow motion, still in my direction. 

&#x200B;

“I told you, come in. This is your fault.”

&#x200B;

She said this as she looked up. I saw here terrible face. She had black eyes, her skin hanging down so far off her face that it looked as if it was melting off. Blemishes all over and a few blackish bloody teeth that were jagged and pierced her gums as she smiled at me.  

&#x200B;

I still couldn’t move, and she was now close enough to touch me when suddenly, there was a flash. A bright light like I had never witnessed. I woke up in bed with my wife sitting on the edge leaning over me. 

&#x200B;

She was crying. She told me she rushed home after I didn’t reply to her when I first texted her an hour ago and she found me lying unconscious in our bed. I couldn’t speak at first, but then everything quickly came back to me like a hellish dream.  

&#x200B;

“The cave.” I said. 

&#x200B;

And there was a knock at the door.

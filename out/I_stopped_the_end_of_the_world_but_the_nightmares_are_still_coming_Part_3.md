Do you know that when you are doing nothing, it feels like you are aware of *everything*?

That’s how I felt sitting in that dark room. Hours just seemed to fly by. I could hear people moving outside, talking in soft, serious voices. It was a callous blend of syllables, too fast and soft to hear anything.

The air was very cold. Goosebumps had started to crawl up my skin. Maybe I was hallucinating, but the ticking of a clock was thrumming through my ears. My phone battery had died out ages ago, so I didn’t really know how long I had been here. Though sitting there, in silence and complete darkness, it could’ve been forever.

Sometimes when I look too closely, I see things. A shadow of something directly next to me, that of a big black dog. Well, that was what it looked like, at least. In that room, cold and alone, your mind creates things. Things you can’t really comprehend when you are sane.

When I blacked out, which is more and more often, I saw a pair of glowing red eyes staring back at me. Like little rubies.

I think as time went on, whatever that thing was was becoming bolder. My face was wet with drool and so hot, like standing next to a furnace. And one day, as my eyes rolled back into my head, and as my vision blurred and colours blended together I saw its face, or rather, something that looks like a face, distorted in the near black darkness. It constantly shifted so I couldn’t make out any distinct facial features, but I did remember two pristine white fangs.

Fangs that sunk into my throat.

I cried out, a gasp of air from my throat, since I was so weak at this point that I doubted I made any noise, and maybe I thrashed around a bit. Struggled. No use fighting against it—whenever I tried my hand just passed right through it like it wasn’t there. It pinned me down with its paws, and I couldn’t crawl away. Not that I had the energy to do so anyway.

More time passed after that, the invisible clock was still ticking its invisible hands, and I could see my blood dripping wet on the floor, before vanishing in the darkness.

I breathed a sigh of relief when I heard the creature leave, or rather—felt a swoosh of air past me and a certainty that I was alone again. Then the next miraculous thing happened:

*The door was open*

Or was it a door? It looked more like a rectangle of shining light that burned so bright.

I crawled towards the doorway with the rest of my strength. It had opened up to a great field full of stars. The grass was swaying in the breeze and the wind was whistling in my ears.

There was a strange feeling in my throat. I was thirsty. My eyes were drawn to the centre of the field. It was all bricked up.

With the last of my strength I crawled over and shifted the heavy bricks aside. It was a well, and inside it was water. It shimmered in the moonlight, and I could see my reflection.

I knelt down on all fours and greedily lapped the water up like a dog. I clawed at the grass for support. It felt…good. Like drinking ice-cold lemonade.

Yet the grass felt *weird*. Not thin and wispy, but thick and leathery. The well suddenly moaned and heaved, then let out an ear-splitting scream that shook me into reality.

I stared in horror at the neck before me, the flesh torn apart by my own hands, leaving behind a gaping hole of crimson. My hands were sticky with blood; and I was conscious of the ring around my mouth.

Too much was going through my head. 

“I’m…sorry.”

It was all I could muster. The man’s eyes rolled back into his head. He was clawing at a photograph soaked in blood. A laughing family at the beach. *I love you, my dear Gucci*, written desperately and shakily in blood at the back.

Guilt made my heart sink. I tore my gaze away from him, and ran away as far as I could.

I wasn’t really paying attention to the time, or how the hot sun beat down on my back. Hot tears streamed down my cheeks. I was angry. Not just at that principal—or angel—Saint Laurent (whose name burned into my head and I wished I never knew), but at *myself*. I couldn’t resist. I had walked straight into her trap.

I was weak.

At some point I ran into Tasaki and several of my former friends. She had no glasses now, and her skin had turned sickly and pale. She was giggling, sucking fresh blood off her claws. 

“Tasaki,” I said urgently.

What was I doing? She was beyond saving. They all were. I’d known it myself; I had seen that well and that grass and that circle of stars. But still my heart lit up with hope. 

Tasaki grunted, walked past me like I was part of the air, and ambled on towards a church that rose up grandly from the ground. I had no watch, but from the way the sun struck the rosy red spires, painting the walls golden, I guessed it was about 5:30pm. Close to sunset.

At one point Tasaki turned and looked at me, and I saw momentarily, in those eyes of hers, that same girl who smiled at me on the train to school and extended a hand to someone who would soon be an outcast. Then it all vanished into a gaze as cold and icy and steel and she disappeared into the cathedral.

I tried to enter myself, but a jolt shot throughout my spine and I yelped.

When the doors finally slammed shut I pressed my ear against the walls. I heard a faint murmur, more a chant, really, growing louder and louder—and my skin prickled with fear.

Then her hissing, distorted voice crashed through my ears and I winced. I put my hand on them and it came away sticky and crimson.

She was speaking in a way I had never heard before. It didn’t sound English. I don’t know how to describe it. Eerie. Ethereal. A babble of ancient tongues that should be left long forgotten.

The earth trembled beneath my feet. I looked up to see the sky was opening up into swirls of red and pink and black, like a mystical galaxy. Tentacles shot out of the portal and whipped the sky.

The chants grew louder. The word ‘God’ was being tossed around like a ship on a stormy sea. My skin contracted, pressed onto my bones, and I screamed, but that was drowned out by the chanting and the roaring of whatever it was in the sky.

Then, my eyes watering in pain, I looked down at myself and saw *M* branded onto my arm. It was growing impossibly bigger, wrapping around my arm, and I swore it had started to hiss.

Finally I understood.

I understood the book I had found in the Library at last.

I understood what it meant by ‘setting free’.

And I didn’t like what I had realised.

The tentacles had started to reach down through the church roof. The metal bent open. I could hear the Saint singing in joy. But to me it sounded more like somebody screeching through the microphone.

There was a petrol station near the church. It was abandoned; the workers had wisely decided to seek shelter. Nearby were tons and tons of red jerry cans. 

Coincidentally, it was getting hotter too, even though it was close to the evening. I was sweating bullets.

Time seemed to have stopped, but the sun had come out fully. The paint had started to melt. I figured I could work that out in my favour.

I didn’t like my plan, but I was running out of time. Her head was partially out of the church now. Pale and grotesque like the dying sun. The sky was beginning to rumble and crack. Clouds fell to the ground like flies.

I sprinted to the petrol station, tears welling into my eyes, and I threw the oil over the church. Black, slimy and thick. It slid down the walls and crept outwards towards the grass.

And exactly as I hoped, the too-hot sun struck the oil at exactly the right angle, and the church went up into flames. I saw it spread, dancing around the walls, before plummeting into the roof.

The resounding screams shattered my eardrums and I curled into a ball behind a bush and started to shake. My heart was pounding deep into my chest, and my mind whirled with consequences. Possible consequences. Saint Laurent realising it was me. Saint Laurent exacting her revenge. She got me once; she could do it again.

Then I heard the screech of sirens and instinct took over and I started to run. I darted into an alleyway and collapsed on the ground. All by myself, I started to laugh. I couldn’t keep the image of Saint Laurent melting like candle-wax while the flames reached up to her neck out of my head and it gave me a sense of great peace.

It was all over.

The nightmare was *finally* over.

***
We don’t talk about what happened in May. 

We *never* talk about what happened in May.

But I reckon I will write it down here, to hopefully give myself some sense of closure. You and I both. I still haven’t forgotten all the suggestions I got to escape out of Maria Buchanatti School back in April. I’m still grateful to y’all.

So thanks.

Still it has given me nightmares. I’ll toss and turn in bed thinking of my friends. My teachers, like Mr Omega and Ms Cartier, gave me the best time of my life while I was still in school. And of course the monsters, the scratching on the walls. The momentarily flash when Tasaki looked at me near the church. They all blend together in my dreams and I will wake up screaming.

We still don’t talk about Saint Laurent. Or what had happened. I don’t want to remember. Not any more.


Months have passed now, and it’s August, the height of summer. My relatives are here.I still haven’t breathed a word on what has happened, but they know I have been through a lot. The day after I came home, my father walked into the river. I never forgot the vacant look in his eyes, his too-stiff gait. It added on to my nightmares; and I figured it was Saint Laurent’s way of punishing me, even after death.

 Most people would celebrate and go out to enjoy the sun. I, on the other hand, would rather lie in bed and ruminate, deaf to my mother calling my name.

Until my little cousin Swarovski skips into my room. 

“Pan Pan!” she calls out.

I sit up and smile thinly. She’s 8. Never fails to make my day, no matter the occasion.

“I got into a new school!” she boasts proudly, and shoves a piece of paper into my face.

The first thing I recognised was the seal. Red like blood. The same on mine back in January.

Swarovski continues to babble on and on about the new school and all the friends she is going to make but it is all meaningless to my ears. I raise my eyes and my blood runs cold.

A shadow of a woman is standing in my room, with long black hair and wearing a red dress and red eyes. She grins at me, showing off a pair of white fangs.

She has one hand on Swarovski’s shoulder. 

[*I’m always here,* she whispers to me, and then she is gone in the chilling night.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SimbaKingdom/comments/vpixk6/boo/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

“My name is Max Woods, I am 40 years old and I live in a busy city. Even if we aren’t near each other, I am looking for someone to spoil with all of my money and I think you are the perfect candidate, Angel <3.”

I groaned out loud. Who the fuck writes an introduction message like that? Better yet, who reaches out to random females on the Internet and spouts such *crap?*

“Guess it’s better than a dick pic.” I joked as I went to delete the message from my Instagram account’s DMs. Something made me hesitate though. It wasn’t that I needed a guy to talk to, or that I wanted the trouble of keeping an open line of communication with a stranger for months on end but… I *did* need money. And a lot of it. Pretending to be a writer and then not selling, publishing, or really writing anything worthy is exhausting, bank-emptying work.

I went for it.

“How did you find my account babe?” I winced at the use of the word “babe”. I didn’t use it even when I was dating someone. “Max” started typing a response immediately. My concern that he was just a bot spamming rando accounts on Insta grew.

“You can pay a lot of money to get into someone’s private account nowadays. I don’t mean to scare you, but I’ve been following you for quite some time. I had to see if you were the right Angel for me <3”

I knew my account was private and I didn’t remember accepting Max’s request to follow me. My suspension only growing, I clicked over to my followers list and scanned through. My jaw dropped when I saw his name on the list.

“See me Angel <3?” A new message popped up. I frantically typed out a response.

“Okay, so you’re a real follower. How do I know you’re a real human, with real money??”

“Check CashApp Angel <3” Was his response. I laughed, I hadn’t used my CashApp since my last go at making money online. *If* he had sent me money how did he even know the username?

I clicked over to the app, feeling like I was wasting my time. My jaw dropped, again, when I saw a deposit of $100 from Max Woods. I knew you had to register with your real name, so his name was real, his money was real…. He was real.

“What do you want babe?” I went with it again. “What would our arrangement be?”

“I work a stressful job and need relief. I just want a few pictures, some sweet videos per day. I’ll pay you an allowance of 1k every week, just for being my sweet little Angel and helping me out <3”

I left him on read for the moment. I needed to think.

Eventually I decided 1k a week was worth putting my life and sanity at risk. I reached out to him, agreed, and we started chatting. Surprisingly, Max didn’t bore me right away. I enjoyed my conversation with him. We seemingly had a lot in common, but I reminded myself that he had been following me for an unknown amount of time, so he could be using the knowledge he had to play the game and keep me talking.

He didn’t request a picture or video that night and when I signed off for bed he said “sleep well Angel <3” and sent me another $100. I slept soundly; why get worked up over good conversation and money? Sure, it was weird that he found me and hacked my social media account but…

When I woke the next day he had requested a picture of “Angel’s bedhead <3”. I snapped a quick shot of my morning Medusa hair and sent it to him. Dude had already seen my face, what was one more pic with my face in it?

“We have to fix that.” Was his response. No Angel, no stupid heart emoji… What the hell was so wrong with my hair?

“Fix it how??” I responded, a little hurt honestly. Stupid.

“Every think of dyeing it?” He responded. I wasn’t particularly attached to my auburn hair, and if he was willing to pay for it, why not jump at the chance for change?

“For free Daddy?” I asked, cringing hard. It was too early to be calling someone who wasn’t my father “Daddy”.

He said he’d pay. He listed off the salon he wanted me to go to (it was a few towns over, he said he had seen my location tagged a few times before) and gave me specific hair instructions. He said he’d made an appointment with “their best girl.” I only had an hour to get dressed and rush over to the strange salon.

I gave them his instructions and chatted with Max while the nice lady worked on my hair. He wanted a platinum blonde, shoulder-length blonde, as straight as they could get it. The woman working on my hair was the salon owner and had the most experience out of everyone; she mentioned being shocked someone had requested her by name, and even more shocked at the amount the client had paid to get in ASAP.

“That’s my Daddy for you.” I muttered. I was beginning to get a clear picture about Max’s easy-going spending habits.

“I wish my father was still around.” The woman joked as she laid another strip of foil over my hair. I almost laughed out loud, but didn’t correct her on what I had meant by Daddy.

Three hours later the lady showed me my hair. She seemed exceptionally proud of her work (probably worried about that “big client”) and I was quite fond of it in the end, too. I had never cared too much about hair but I made a damn good looking blonde!

“Want the receipt?” The prim and proper receptionist asked me on my way out. I nodded, hell yes I wanted the receipt! I had never been to a salon so I didn’t quite understand all the charges, like “booth rent per hour charge” etc. But I saw that the short-notice scheduling fee was $200 by itself, and the bill was over $400!

“Did he tip?” I asked the woman who had worked on my hair. She nodded gravely.

“Very well, ma’am.” She told me.

Ma’am? Ugh.

I hopped in my car and immediately the “ping” of my messages went off.

“Picture for me, Angel <3?”

How did he know I was finished? Was my phone bugged? Was he just that familiar with how long the salon process takes?

I snapped a picture, genuinely smiling and showing off, and sent it to him.

“I make a damn fine blonde Daddy, thank you <3” I messaged.

“You look beautiful Angel, now time for a wardrobe change <3”

I had wanted to go home but he sent me to a nearby lingerie/sex shop with a list of items to buy. The list was fairly normal until I saw silk ties that match, handcuffs, latex and a ball gag. I questioned him on the items and he simply responded, “For my pictures Angel <3”

Okay, weirdo. I had always wanted to spice up my nighttime wardrobe, but could never afford it. Now when I found a man IRL worth my time, I could pull out lingerie bought and paid for by an Internet stranger.

I gathered up the items on the list in a daze. Their price tags were hefty; the price for the latex caused my stomach to curl, how would I afford all this shit with the measly $200 in my CashApp account??

As I approached the desk the store’s phone rang. The teenager manning the desk answered it in a bored voice, but sharpened quickly. I watched as his whole demeanor change, while he said “yes sir, of course sir” a lot, his eyes wide open.

He typed a few things into the computer and hung up quickly.

The teenager was blushing furiously and wouldn’t make eye contact with me. That was fine, because once I got the total and inevitably started crying over the price I wouldn’t want him to look at me, anyway.

He didn’t give me a price though. He didn’t ask for a card, or my CashApp, or a form of ID or anything. He bagged everything in a much neater, organized way than I felt he normally would and handed the bags gently to me, still without looking at me.

“Courtesy of D-Daddy.” He said in a dazed tone.

I took the bags and left the store. As soon as my car door closed behind me my phone went off.

“Photoshoot for Daddy when you get home, don’t dilly dally Angel <3 I’ll put your allowance in once I’ve got those beautiful pictures <3”

I drove home quickly, barely remembering the drive I was so stunned. I *had* told myself that 1k a week was worth putting my life in danger. So what if he was clearly having me watched?

I wondered whether he was using technology to spy on me, or if some secret bodyguard/spy was following me around! That idea seemed a little too absurd, like I had watched one too many movies on Lifetime. I almost asked him how he knew where I was and how he knew when I was done with everything, but he said not to dilly dally so I didn’t bother.

I slapped on some makeup, trying to look “angelic” and not like an “Internet whore”. I closed my blinds against the pretty natural sunlight and went to try on the lingerie and start taking pictures.

“Open the blinds Angel <3” He messaged immediately. I rolled my eyes and the hair on my arms stood straight up; I was officially creeped out, and maybe there was a spy involved??

“Hey I’m not giving another person a free show!” I snapped.

He responded by dropping $2,000 into my CashApp.

“Trust me.” He demanded. I said fuck it, and opened the window for all to see my little photoshoot.

I flounced around my room, bending and posing and generally showing off as I took the pictures he requested. I did feel genuinely sexy, especially in the latex outfit! I had never worn latex before and decided I needed to do it more often.

After every picture he commented on how beautiful I was, how I was a “good little model” and his “little angel”. I saved the pictures for myself, too. I could definitely get laid with a portfolio like that!

As the days went on his requests became stranger. He wanted me to wear certain outfits at certain times of days so I had to go to several different stores to buy the specific items he had in mind. At every shop I went to, shops that had been there for years but that I hadn’t entered because I’m a broke millennial, the phone would ring as I was checking out. Everywhere I went, people seemed to know exactly who Max was. It was like he had longtime accounts set up all across my hometown!

He never offered to send me pictures of himself, lewd or otherwise, and I never asked. I sent him the pictures he requested and if I was in a good mood and wanted to be complimented I even sent him some pictures he didn’t request. Max seemed to genuinely care for me and want to hear about my day, he even said he liked my writing!

The money kept flowing, it just got weird.

At one point he wanted “to watch me bleed”. He dropped $500 into my account so without hesitation I took a video of me making a tiny cut over my heart; my metaphorical way of saying I was super dedicated to his wallet. He was so pleased with the video and the heart thing that he dropped another $500!

He wanted pictures of my bare feet close to a fire (that one was a little tricky to figure out), videos of me showering in super hot and then super cold water, and finally he asked for my finger and toenail clippings.

“But I’d need your mailing address for that Daddy.” I said, hoping he’d change his mind on that one. I wasn’t ready to exchange addresses. Or send parts of my body through the postal office.

He sent me the address without hesitation and asked that I hurried and got it done before the post office closed. I quickly cut and collected my nails and drove to the post office. I paid for express shipping (Daddy didn’t call in on that one, the post office doesn’t care how much money you have). They didn’t question the contents of the tiny envelope at all, just printed off a tracking number and sent me on my way.

When I got home I realized I kinda wanted to see what a man who wants toenail clippings looked like. I had his address, I apparently had his real name… Why not? I Googled the address and was shocked to see that it was the state penitentiary. I thought there must have been some mistake, but when I Googled his name my blood ran cold.

The first article contained a mugshot. I stared at a middle-aged, fairly attractive Max Woods for a minute before clicking the article. “Serial Killer Gets Caught! Whole Town Rejoices!” The article’s title claimed. My hands shook as I scrolled through.

“The cozy town of ------ was terrified into locking their doors when a string of murders broke out in 2010. In just six months seventeen women were kidnapped, brutalized, and murdered. Police quickly realized this was the work of a honed serial killer when they compared the women (listed below) and their appearances. The women were all of average height and build, with dyed blonde hair. They were all named Sarah. Max Woods, 30, was caught in the act last Saturday. He was arrested and immediately admitted to his crimes. The community was shocked that the killer was Max; everyone knew him as the charming boy who won their hearts in high school, went on to invent big things, return home and donate huge portions of money to anything and everything the town needed.

Max Woods claims he has killed over 100 women in his time.

His trial is set for December 14th and the state will be pursuing the death penalty.”

The article went on to list the names of the women who were murdered and how they were murdered: burned to death, choked to death, bled to death... They showed their pictures, too, and my eyes filled with tears as I looked at picture after picture of women who looked *just like me*. It was clear he was still behind bars and that his money had probably gotten him out of the death penalty. Why me??

My phone pinged.

“Now you know Angel <3” He messaged me. I wanted to throw my phone through the window. I didn’t answer him. I didn’t want to communicate with a pervy serial killer!

My CashApp notified me of a deposit. I rolled my eyes and opened it, convinced no amount of money could make [me](https://twitter.com/drunktilTuesday) respond to Max.

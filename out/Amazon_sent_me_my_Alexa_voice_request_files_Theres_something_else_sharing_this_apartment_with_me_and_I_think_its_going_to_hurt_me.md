[PART II](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/se3ynm/maria_came_over_but_its_not_maria_whatever_took/)

I was chatting with a friend recently and she mentioned that she'd asked Amazon to send her all of the personal data the company had collected on her.  She figured it would be quite a bit of data, but was surprised the data package included the actual audio recordings of her voice telling Alexa to do things.  She said she only listened to about a half dozen files before getting bored, but she couldn't help but feel a little creeped out knowing Amazon employees could listen to things like  her telling Alexa to add tampons to her shopping list.

Intrigued, I sent Amazon a request for my data archive.  I have an Alexa too - my mother got it for me a few birthdays ago - but I don't really use it much.  Occasionally I'll shout at Alexa to remind me to get the laundry, or do some errand.  Mostly I tell Alexa to play music.  I almost never shop on Amazon, so I figured my data package would be small.

A few days later I got an email with a .zip file containing hundreds of .wav files. "Weird," I thought, "I only yell at this thing

I clicked the first one and heard myself telling Alexa to play Vampire Weekend.  I decided to check out a few more.

"Alexa, what's the weather in Detroit tomorrow?"

"Alexa, remind me in 25 minutes to get my laundry."

"Alexa, tell Maria she's pretty",  a man's voice spoke with a deep, almost sinister tone.

My heart seemed to pause for the briefest moment.  I clicked the same file again.

"Alexa, tell Maria she's pretty."

The files didn't have any timestamps on them, but it didn't matter.  I hadn't had a man, friend or otherwise, over to my place in more than a year.  I clicked the next file.

"Alexa, tell Maria I like it when she wears makeup."

The next file:  "Alexa, remind Maria to wear makeup."

I don't recall ever having Alexa remind me to wear makeup...

I continued clicking the files, both intrigued and increasingly unnerved. Each one was the same voice with a new request, with my own voice occasionally chiming in to ask for music.

"Alexa, when is Maria coming home?"

"Alexa, I want Maria to come home soon."

"Alexa, WHY isn't Maria home yet?" The voice sounded impatient and aggressive.

"What the fuck!?" I took a deep breath but by this point my heart was thundering.  I call my friend.

"Hey Maria, what's up"

"Sarah.  I did that data request thing from Amazon...did you have any weird shit in yours"

"Only if you call asking  Alexa if she thinks Ryan Reynolds would date me is weird"

"Well I do - listen to this."  I played the file of the strange voice saying I was pretty.

"Who's that?  You have some nerd over?  About time, Maria, you've gotta be dry as a cracker by now."

"NO," I shouted, "I haven't had ANYONE over!  I don't know who that voice is"

I played her a few more.

"Are you fucking with me, Maria.  That is creepy AF."

"Sarah I swear to God these just showed up in the files.  I have no idea who this guy is or why they are here, but I'm really freaked out."

"So play some more"

"I don't really want to," I mumbled before clicking the next one.

"Alexa, play Tegan and Sara," I heard myself say

"I KNEW you were a lesbian!" Sarah shrieked.

"Shut up, this is fucking scary"

The next one was the man's voice again, this time almost whimpering, "Alexa, Maria never pays attention to me."

"Alexa, Maria needs to put makeup on today or I am going to VERY upset."

"ALEXA, WHY ISN'T SHE WEARING MAKEUP.  I LIKE IT WHEN SHE WEARS MAKEUP"

"ALEXA DO SOMETHING"

"ALEXA, MAKE HER DO IT"

"ALEXA MARIA IS MAKING ME VERY ANGRRRUHHHH"

The voice trailed off in a deep, slow growl, almost like the recording had been slowed down.

"Maria."  Sarah's voice cracked over the phone. "Do you want to come stay with me tonight?"

I bit my lip to keep myself from bursting into tears.  The soles of my feet tingled with nervous fear. "Yeah, I think so.  Let me throw some stuff in a bag and I'll be over in 20 mins.  You better have vodka.   I'm going to need to drink.

I grabbed a bag and threw a few clothes in it.  Moving to the bathroom I grabbed my toothbrush and toothpaste.  My makeup kit was sitting on the counter.  Where I never store it.   Ever.  It's always in the top drawer.  I hadn't even used it for a week.

BA-BING.  Alexa chimed.

"This is your reminder.   Maria, you can't leave.  You're staying here tonight.   With me."

In the hallway I heard the deadbolt click shut.

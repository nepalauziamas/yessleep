This looks like it might be the last email from Nassir or whoever the hell was sending these. I’m no closer to finding Carrie after all of this but it does potentially answer the question of where she has disappeared to. 

At this rate I don’t know if I’ll ever see her again. She wanted to devote her life to science, well it would appear that is what she has done. Even if it’s not the most wholesome science. Quite the opposite, in fact.  

I know she wanted to change the world. 

It looks like she got her wish. But I really wish she’d decided to change it for the better. 

The Observers (First Draft)

May 2020

We are swallowed up by the enormous black building, the sign atop reading “PROTEON”. 

As the bus drives further into the underground garage, I see that the place is bustling with activity. There are thousands of shadow people moving to and fro, performing various functions. 

Talking to Garrett is difficult from the back of the bus.  I raise my voice so that he can hear me. 

Nassir: What the hell is this place, Garrett? Why did you bring us here?

Garrett: This is the headquarters of Proteon Corporation, my friends. 

Nassir: I don’t understand. I thought that’s where we came from?

Garrett: Ah, but this is the mirror image of it. The opposite of our world of light. This is the shadow realm. The Forest of Decay separates the two. The forest will not let you leave once you enter it, if you try to cross over to the other realm. Unless of course, you are able to obtain assistance. 

Woman in Black: Assistance at a price. Everything with a price. 

Garrett: Of course. Can’t forget that. The toll.

Nassir: And what exactly is the cost for this voyage to the other side? 

My mouth is dry as I ask the question. I already know the answer before he says it. 

Garrett: All in good time, my friend. All in good time. Ah! Here is the elevator!

The bus drives into an enormous elevator and after the doors close behind us I feel it rising up. Finally, after a few minutes, we reach the top floor and the door opens up again in front of us. 

The bus exits the giant elevator, and I see we are in a huge room with windows on all sides. We are on the top floor of Proteon headquarters. 

Garrett: Alright, everybody off the bus!

My heart begins to pound faster and faster. Without the night-vision windows on the bus everything will be pitch black and terrifying out there. 

Ted and Wayne pull us to our feet and we are shoved out the door at the front of the bus. Darkness envelops us and I can see nothing. Even my hand in front of my face doesn’t register. 

Ted and Wayne are even sounding scared, and I realize they have never done this before. They have never been to this place of shadow and infinite darkness. 

Garrett’s voice booms from above us and I feel disoriented immediately, having no idea where he is standing. Is it the real Garrett or the hologram? He answers my question when he appears in front of me, illuminated by blue light which seems to radiate from inside him. 

He floats over to me on the air itself, and I see his eyes are glowing intensely as he stares at me. 

Garrett: Why do you look so scared, Nassir? Are you afraid that your interview will never see the light of day? That it will die in this world of shadow? 

In the eerie blue light, I can see that if he was once a man, he is no longer that. This is something else entirely now. The hologram is gone. A creature hovers in the air – half human and half dark necromantic sorcerer – borne of black magic and twisted science. 

Garrett: You tried so hard to keep up. To write your article as all the madness occurred around us. And yet here you are, at the end. And despite all your hard work, nothing to show for it. No Pulitzer. No publication. But hey, I’m feeling generous. I’ll tell you what. I’ll let you have your article. Carrie can bring it back to earth with her. I can’t go back there now. Not after what I’ve become. But Carrie will, won’t you dear?

I can barely see her nod in the dim blue light cast by the eerie glow of the CEO’s internal power source. 

Carrie: Whatever you wish. It doesn’t matter anymore what happens in that realm. We can recruit from others. Where do you want me to send it? Newsweek? Time Magazine? 

Garrett: Somewhere less noticeable...  Just in case we need to go back there for some reason.  You can decide. 

Carrie: I have a cousin who likes to post on Reddit Nosleep. I can send it to him? It’ll probably just die in “New”.

Garrett: Perfect. Go ahead, Nassir. Finish typing it up, and we’ll be sure to send it back with her. Any more questions you’d like to ask before she leaves? 

Nassir: What will happen to us? What is he going to do to us? 

Carrie: I’d prefer not to know. The woman in black has been working with him. This city was once nothing more than a tiny village. Now look at it. He needs recruits, people to perform the various tasks and functions to keep this place running. He makes me bring them over from earth and then they stay here. They become part of the shadow world. That’s all I really know. 

Nassir: But why? To accomplish what end? 

Garrett: This isn’t enough for your readers? To know that there is another world on the other side? What more can I show you? 

He hovers up towards the ceiling, glowing blue lightning bolts shooting from his fingertips. 

Garrett: Your world is nothing compared to this one. The light energy from earth can be brought to this reality and can be redirected with only a thought. Your life force is worthless on earth, but here… Here it is another power plant added to the growing number that fuel me. I can do anything here! This entire city, formed with only thoughts and energy. Soon this world will glow with life just like ours. And I will rule over all of it. 

Nassir: So… That’s what it comes down to. Power. You just want this world for yourself. Infinite power and a world of shadow people controlled by you, doing your bidding. A global empire made of darkness. Did you ever consider that this place wasn’t meant to be tampered with? 

Garrett: Watch your words carefully. This can be quick and painless, or I can make it otherwise, the choice is up to you. 

The woman in black suddenly begins to glow as well, and floats up towards the ceiling to join him there. 

The eyes of both of them are blank and white as they stare at us and the room begins to hum with electricity that shoots off of them like lightning. The air sizzles and pops with energy. 

Woman in black: Any final words? Before you can speak no longer?

For once in my life I can think of nothing to ask. I shake my head no. 

I take one last breath of alien air in this world that is not ours, and await my fate. 

The woman in black pulls back her veil. I understand why it is there, now. What is beneath is far more horrifying than I could have imagined. It makes my heart stop for a second and I lurch forward, breathless. 

As the light begins to shimmer all around me, I see our energy flowing like a river towards her and Garrett, and they drink it in like water. 

I can feel the life draining out of me. The light draining out of me. 

And then a noise like trees and foliage rustling comes from behind us. I look back and see a strange sight. 

From beneath the bus, a tree is emerging. Only this tree has arms and legs. As he stands tall I can tell he is a massive being, his head nearly touching the ceiling in the cavernous room. 

It is the tree man from the forest. He had been a stowaway beneath the bus since we stopped, it would seem. By the looks of it, he somehow attached himself to the bottom of the bus with the vines that slithered and moved around him like snakes. 

Garrett: What the hell is that thing!?

Woman in black: You were not meant to come here!

Tree: Neither were you, mother of death. You were to stay in the forest, but you rebuked the rules! You chose to interfere. You chose power over structure. Darkness over light. 

Garrett and the woman in black are floating near the ceiling and their eyes meet the tree man’s eyes. They raise their hands and dark energy pours forth, like living fire the colour of smoke, it attacks the tree. 

His leaves and bark catch ablaze in places and he stumbles backwards for a second. I can see his mossy mouth twitching with what could be pain, but overall the attack is insignificant. He stamps out the small fires that have formed in places across his chest where the attack was focused. 

In an instant, the power is dwindling down, and I see Garrett’s face and the dawning apprehension there. 

The sound of many footfalls fills the room. More and more by the second. Hundreds, then thousands of them. They are outside, climbing the building. Smashing the windows. On the roof. 

Tree: Get back on the bus. It may be too late for you, but you must at least try to make it back to your world. You must warn people not to ride the bus. He is too powerful, and cannot be stopped if we don’t do something.  

I remember the words Garrett and Carrie had exchanged. The mention about time dilation. It might already be too late.

We climb onto the bus just before the shadow people begin to pour in. They swarm and soon the room is full of them. They ignore us and head straight for Garrett and the woman in black. The Mother of Death. 

I look out the window of the bus and with the night vision technology can make out the scene perfectly. 

My heart hammering with terror and relief at having escaped, I can’t pry my eyes away. 

Garrett is being torn to pieces by the shadow people. He brought them all here, from various dimensions I would find out later. They were all victims of his power grab. His attempt to gain dominion over this place – the world that lies beneath all other worlds.

The shadow realm. 

They pull off his face and rip off his arms. Plunging their hands into his chest they tear out his heart and his blue and glowing blood goes everywhere. They drink it in and start to look human again. 

As Carrie orders the bus to reverse and the elevator doors close, I wonder what will happen to them. If they’ll make it back to where they came from. 

The journey back to the giant oak tree was uneventful, so I won’t bore you with the details of it. When we arrive at the entrance to the forest it opens up for us, welcoming us. The trees move to the side and create a pathway for the bus, hopeful for our departure from this world. 

Ted and Wayne made it back on the bus with us, and have decided to enforce Garrett’s orders. They make me hand over my laptop to Carrie after the giant oak swallows the bus in darkness once again and the realm of earth appears on the other side. 

I only hope that she will stop this madness and participate in Garrett’s horrible venture no more. I tell her this.

Carrie: I guess I’m the new lead engineer now. You know, I’ve always wanted to research dark energy. Dark matter. Very interesting topics. I brought this back to study.

In her hand, she holds a chunk of rubble from the Proteon building, like a souvenir of our close encounter with death. 

She gasps as she inspects the utterly dark surface of it. It absorbs all light and casts a growing shadow. The shadow extends, and I realize it is not a shadow at all, but that the blackness of it is spreading like a malignancy across Carrie’s hand. 

Reflexively, she drops the black stone to the ground. It stops the spread of necrotic death that is making its way across her flesh, but begins to spread instead across the floor, slowly. Like a puddle of oil as it expands. And does not stop. 

Carrie: I suppose I shouldn’t have brought that back here.

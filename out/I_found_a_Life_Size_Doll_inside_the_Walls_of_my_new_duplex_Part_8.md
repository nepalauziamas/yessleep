Even though I smelled like shit from the [dumpster](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/wij3hh/i_found_a_life_size_doll_inside_the_walls_of_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) I went for a drink. There’s a small bar not far from the rental properties I found on my smart phone, and I wore a sour expression for them to know not to ask questions. 

I took some shots, watched cars drive by and tried to drown my sorrows. 

I didn’t want to be ready to give up on Macie, but it felt like this was the end. Without that spellbook I wasn’t sure where to turn. 

I kept replaying Sarah’s last moments before she was crushed to death. Not only had it mortified me, but it shocked me because I hadn’t expected to see Rose toss her away so quickly. 

Did that mean that Andrea and Bill had lied about their connection? Was I just running around in circles for a couple of mad people that were toying with me?

Eventually as much as I dreaded it, I had to return to the empty duplex. As it turned out though, it wasn’t so empty after all. 

Two patrol cars had returned, lights flashing because it was almost dusk. And before I even had to guess who had called them I saw Macie’s dad’s truck. 

I wanted to be upset but I was past that point, he didn’t know he was causing more trouble. And as I approached the house, he was the first to speak. 

“Trish where the heck have you been?” he said. 

The landlord was there too, having allowed the cops entry as they finished up their questions with Chuck. 

“Dinner,” I slurred. I was still too buzzed to really dare ask why the police had returned. 

He held a hand over his mouth. “You’re drunk. What the hell happened today? These two officers said you reported a break in. Why did you not mention that earlier?” he snapped. 

The landlord chimed in too, “Yes, and where is your roommate? You've been acting very suspicious all afternoon, lass.”

The officers gave me an icy glare. 

“Remember our conversation last time?” the first cop said. I was fully expecting that he was going to cuff me, but thankfully Chuck spoke up for me and remarked, “I don’t believe Trish would be involved. Besides… it hasn’t even been 48 hours. We should wait and see if Macie turns up,” Chuck admitted. 

“All right. But we are going to take a few things from the duplex, to check and see if anything of Macie’s matches the DNA we got earlier,” the second man said. My addled brain understood immediately what they were implying. They thought I had something to do with Macie’s disappearance! Immediately I panicked and blurted out, “You need a warrant to do that!” 

“I gave them permission. Remember, this property still belongs to me,” the landlord snapped back. I did my best to not look like I was worried. I knew the officers believed they were just doing their job. 

“We should have results by the morning. Have a good night,” the first cop said as he tipped his hat toward Chuck and left.

The landlord walked out next, looking at me with added suspicion. “If we had known you would be a problem, we would never have let you rent here!”

Then Chuck and I were finally alone. He crossed his arms like he was about to give me a lecture. 

“Chuck please I can explain…” 

“I hope it’s a good one, Trish, because I’m at my limit here. I’ve put up with a lot of things with Macie over the years, and always done my best to stand by her even when I don’t agree with her life choices. God knows if her mother was still around she would be mortified at the thought of her living with…” 

He took a breath and closed his eyes before he said anything he might regret. 

“Look, I can understand why you thought you didn’t want to involve me with the break-in. But why did you lie to those officers? They said you never even mentioned Macie to them. And then you caused a disturbance at the neighbors? And the landlord said you were looking through the trash earlier! Just what the heck is going on?” 

“I didn’t say anything because if I did, you would think I’m insane. That it’s ludicrous,” I responded. 

He crossed his arms again. “Just try me.”

I checked the time, realizing that the neighbor was likely already at work. 

Then I remembered the spare key and I realized that as much as I didn’t want anyone else involved, I needed help now to return to sanity. 

“Follow me,” I said as we went to the neighbor’s door and I found the spare key before saying, “It would be easier if I just show you.”

As we unlocked the door and entered Bill’s side of the duplex, I announced our presence to no one in particular. The house was quiet. Andrea was now a doll again. 

The moment he saw it, Chuck’s jaw dropped. 

“It looks so life-like,” he admitted as he stared at the colors and clothing of the doll. 

“That’s because it is… alive I mean,” I said softly. 

Chuck looked at me and raised an eyebrow. 

“Trisha, this isn’t a joke. Why are we here and why are you showing me this creepy doll?” 

Then he got dead quiet for a second. 

“My god. You’re serious.” 

He reached for his phone like he was about to call 911. 

“I can prove it,” I told him as I pointed toward their daughter’s room. 

“Behind that door there is a little girl that can show you I am telling the truth,” I explained. 

“A child? Why aren’t they out here?” Chuck asked as he walked over to the door and tried the handle. Of course it wasn’t budging. 

“You’re telling me the neighbors are locking their daughter up? Why the hell didn’t you tell the police this either??” he asked in exasperation. 

“Because when I saw her earlier she would be a doll. I know, this is asking a lot of you. But there is a key around here somewhere. The girl can show you exactly how this doll comes to life,” I said. 

Chuck bit his bottom lip, trying to decide if he believed me. 

“Just give me this chance. It might help us figure out what happened to Macie,” I pleaded. 

He sighed and gave in, allowing me a chance to look through Mister Langford’s kitchen drawers until I found it. 

“This should be it,” I said, as I tossed it to him. 

The door unlocked a moment later. 

We flicked on the lights and I quickly looked around at the empty room. It looked just like it had when the cops had come in earlier. 

“Well this is definitely creeping me out,” Chuck admitted. “But this reminds me more like a shrine than any child’s room. Besides, Where is she?”

“I’m not sure.. but she was here earlier,” I commented as I looked about the room again. How could she hide so easily? 

“Did you check upstairs?” Chuck commented. At first I thought he was being funny. “There isn’t an upstairs.” 

“I work in house construction, Trish. The way this house is built it could easily have two more rooms upstairs. The attic is sloped in the front and wide in the back. Plenty of room,” he told me. 

I frowned, surprised that it would be sealed off and then looked toward Penny’s closet and remembered how there had been a secret in mine. It made some sense there might be one here as well. 

I opened it, surprised to see that was exactly what was hiding there, a thin staircase leading east toward the attic. It was so dark I could hardly see a thing. I used my phone light and saw that Penny was standing a few steps up with back turned to us. 

“Oh my god you were telling the truth about the girl,” Chuck realized. 

“Penny, there you are. Come down,” I said. But she didn’t respond. I walked up the steps, thinking maybe she hadn’t heard me and grabbed her shoulder. 

Then I realized she was sleepwalking. “Penny wake up,” I insisted as I told Chuck to get me some water. She was whispering under breath and it sounded like she was talking in her dreams. It sounded so unnatural. 


When he returned with a glass I dipped her fingers in it and the girl’s eyes shot up, confused. Unsure how she got there. 

“Is my time up?” she whispered. Chuck’s eyebrows furrowed in concern as he saw the cut on her wrist. “Did you do this?” he asked. 

“I just wanted to help,” she answered. 

He pulled Penny to his side and then started toward the den. 

I hurried behind him. “Where are you going!” I shouted. 

“I’m going to the police station and this girl is coming with me,” he announced. Penny suddenly started to pull against him. 

“No. I can’t. This is my home!” she insisted as she tried to reach for Andrea. 

“This isn’t open for discussion! No parent should ever lock their child away!” Chuck responded. 

He glared at the doll just as Penny slipped from his grip and hugged it tightly. 

“And God knows what else this child has endured living with that!” he announced. 

He pulled out his phone again to dial the police and I was about to shout that he stop but I never got the chance. 

Andrea moved toward him, like a train hurtling down the tracks. Her hand was wrapped around his throat and she slammed Chuck against the wall, dragging him against the plaster. Chuck’s phone flew in the air, skidding under their couch as the doll continued its attack. 

He choked and gagged as he looked down at the doll, too frightened and shocked to fight back as he lost his breath and the living doll prepared to snap his neck. 

Immediately I reached for a glass from their dishwasher and hurled it at the back of the doll’s head. Some of the water seemed to burn the doll, but other than that it had little to no effect except to shatter into dozens of pieces. Andrea’s doll-like head turned almost completely 180 degrees, her cold lifeless eyes staring at me as she prepared to pounce on me next. 

She let Chuck slip to the floor as he gasped for breath, Cornering me in the hallway as my mind raced for a way to stop this thing. This wasn’t like Sarah when she was a human. The doll was like a living unstoppable robot. 

Then I realized there was one thing that would stop it. And as much as I hated to do this, I grabbed Penny and held her close to my body, using her as leverage. 

The child screamed and kicked as I motioned for the doll to move and let me get to Chuck. Much to my relief, the lifeless thing obeyed and stepped aside.

Cautiously I held Penny as tight as I could as we circled each other and I knelt down to Chuck’s side.

I then lifted him to his feet as Penny pried herself free to be by the doll’s side. It was blocking our exit. And I knew it could easily overpower us if it wanted. 

Instead it began to force us into Penny’s room. 

As we stepped across the threshold I grabbed the door and slammed it shut. 

I heard the doll scratch against the door for a moment as I shoved some of the furniture against the door to make a barricade. At the same time Macie’s dad slumped to the floor. 

“Mother of Christ,” he said as he rubbed his neck. 

I knew it was probably the worst timing but despite how shaken up I was, all I responded with was, “ Now do you believe me?”

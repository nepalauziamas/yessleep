My partner didn’t ask me for too many personal requests since he is a fairly private person when it comes to everything. For him to open up to ask something of someone else is a pretty big deal. We had just finished a small case when I noticed his odd mood. No danger to the job. Just running after some small fuzzy creatures in the woods all day to bring them back to their real home. I caught Nick stuffing his suit jacket with them, and I swear if they didn’t already have homes, he would have kidnapped them all. 

Normally after a job Nick sent me on my way home. We didn’t spend much time together outside of work, mostly because we both always so busy. This time he lingered and I could sense something wrong. Instead of sending me back he stood, nudging his foot into the dirt, making a small groove. It was a small motion, but a big indicator something was bothering him.

“Hey Nicker-roonies, what’s eating at you?” I asked and he took a very long time to respond. 

“I think my house is haunted.” He said finally. 

I stared at him. It honestly was hard not to laugh when he dropped comments like that with a completely straight face. Supernatural creatures could not deal with ghosts very well. There were a very limited amount that could take care of them and thus, they were always busy. Humans could deal with the problem but depending on what kind of ghost, it could be life threatening. I thought back to the last ghost we came across. My chest still hurt thinking about the case. Nickie might be too freaked out to go back home, judging on how was acting. But he didn’t want to ask me to do a dangerous favor either. 

“Do you want me to come over and take care of it?” I offered. 

He shook his head. He looked a bit worn out and I assumed it was not from running around the woods all day. Depending on how long this ghost issue had been going on for, he must not have been sleeping very much. 

“I can just stay at hotels until the task force dealing with this sort of thing becomes free. I can drop in during the day to take care of the pets I’ve taken in.” 

From how he looked, he couldn’t sleep at a hotel. Nick appeared to be the type to not be able to sleep well in a new environment. The special task force might take years to finally come by his place. They could only deal with so many cases at once, and only took on the cases where the ghosts had turned dangerous. Even one or two deaths wasn’t enough to get them to drop everything and head over.  

“I can go over and at least take a look. I don’t mind. If it’s dangerous we can split and call in the backup. Maybe I can take care of it without help.” 

Nick kept digging with the tip of his shoe, thinking. The last thing he wanted was to put his partner in danger, but the creatures he took in would also be in danger if his place was haunted and there wasn’t anywhere else they could go. That was what got him to cave in and take me to his massive house to investigate his ghost problem. 

His place looked as fancy as ever. The amount of decorations and material put into making it might cost more than what a small country could afford. Looking over the intricate details carved in the stone, I couldn’t help but wonder what kind of person made this place. The one who created Nick was an Alchemist. I didn’t even know his name, let alone what happened to him. Instead of looking oppressive and overwhelming, the mansion almost had a soft feeling with how it was decorated. This place wasn’t made to flaunt wealth, but rather created as an act of passion. How had the same man make such a grand home and yet create and kill so many stone children that did not live up to his standards? When Nick and I were separated in The Catacombs that were hidden under the mansion, I saw a room filled with broken statues of children that were once alive, who were the failed attempts at making something similar to Nick. I’ve never been able to bring up what I saw that day. Nick’s creator felt like a touchy topic and we never even got close to mentioning him. 

As I started to look around, Nick paused at the front door, a bit nervous to go inside. He slowly opened the massive door expecting something to jump out at us. Nothing happened as we walked inside and to the front room. It had changed a little since I last was there. Piles of stuffed animals were in the middle of being sorted in the massive space. Each pile was labeled with a different charity or hospital. Nick wasn’t the type to want for much. He got paid very well for the jobs he completed for The Corporation so he used the funds to donate whenever he could. From what I saw, his current project was donating toys.  

Nick walked so carefully I didn’t hear his footsteps on the marble flooring as we started across the entryway. He didn't mention anything beyond his place being haunted, so I didn't know what we were looking for.

“So, what’s been going on? Flickering lights? Hearing voices?” I asked as we walked. 

“It’s hard to explain. For the past week I’ve felt eyes on my back. But I can’t sense anything in the room. I know I’m being watched but cannot find the source. Small things around the house have been moved. And I cannot be certain, but I think something was in The Catacombs. I’ve heard noises but I am unable to go down to see what it was.” He explained while staying close to me. Very close. 

“Do you think some creature got inside? And this isn't any of your pets, right?” I said as I looked around. The house felt normal. Not creepy in the slightest.  

Nick shook his head and nearly bumped into me when I stopped walking. If I didn’t know any better, I would think he was scared and yet tried to act cool. I assumed ghosts creeped him out but didn't think they would scare him this much.

“Nothing can get past the barrier. If something did force through, I would have known or would sense another living creature in the house.” 

“So, the only other option is a not living thing?” I suggested. 

Nick nodded, his face looking a bit pale. If he had a reason to be this frightened, then I should be as well. His reactions were making me nervous. I almost debated on letting him stay at my place and wait until the professionals showed up. That was my own weakness talking. I swore I would do better and help out my partner and that was what I was going to do. Looking through his place would be easy enough. It would just take us a while. 

“Alright, let’s start looking. Show me the places where you felt ‘off’ first. We’ll go through this entire place if we need to.” 

Silently Nick showed me along to the second floor. There were so many rooms in the house it was impossible for one person to use them all. I wondered what he was even doing on the second floor. Surely, he could just use the rooms on the first floor, closer to the kitchen. He opened a door to one room showing off how he turned it into a garden of sorts. He had installed overhead lights for the rows of different plants, some of which I’d never seen before. A few were locked away in glass cabinets to prevent anyone from touching them. Nickie sure did have a lot of hobbies.  

“I’ve been growing medical plants for The Corporation. Most of these are used to create mild medicines that can heal humans or weaker creatures. They’re not as potent as the ones harvested from the wild, but at least it’s a source that can be easily be replenished.” 

I walked around the room listening to him as I looked for any signs of the supernatural. The Corporation had a hard time keeping mild medicine in stock. It was so low on their priority list that they couldn’t spare the agents to harvest what was needed for the few contract workers like myself who would need it. Nick had noticed and felt guilty every time I got hurt on a case and nothing was available to fully heal those injuries. The scar on my face a reminder of that, even though it kinda made me look like a badass.  Just as I thought nothing was amiss inside that room, I sensed something. A tingling sensation started on the back of my neck. I turned, expecting to see someone else inside the room. Nothing but me and Nickie. 

So, his mind wasn't playing tricks on him. It didn’t know if it was a ghost but I knew something was in this place. I really hoped it might just a creature Nick had taken in and didn’t know about their abilities. I really did not want to deal with another ghost. 

A noise coming from the other room made us both jump. Nick hadn’t put away The Orchestra from our earlier job and his hand flew to the sword ready to use it. He needed to calm down. The sword was too powerful to use inside the mansion. It would tear the building apart taking me with it. I hurried to place a hand on his elbow, silently telling him to not attack any random sound. We then headed out of the room towards where we thought we heard the crashing.  

The door to the next room looked slightly open. From Nick’s reaction, it wasn’t open before. His feet were planted to the carpeted floor, so I bravely peeked inside. Orange sunlight came through the curtains. He used the room to store random objects. Some looked to be antiques, while others were just things Nick picked up at thrift shops. The clutter made it impossible to tell what had been knocked over to make the sound. I waited for something else to happen and turned to face Nick. When my head turned, another object fell over in the room. Nick flinched and I heard a small sound come from him. I stared at him, not believing my stoic partner let out a sound of fear. He faced so many other frightening creatures and yet some minor unexplained activity in his house was enough to rattle him. 

My nerves were starting to go as well. I needed to be brave but wasn’t able to stop feeling uneasy about everything.  

“Skyler, the window...” He commented in a low voice directing my attention towards it. 

It looked normal. Some clouds covered the sun blocking out the sunset. But they didn’t roll over. Instead, it kept getting darker. Outside the sky got grey and Nick’s face paled.  

“Inside the barrier the weather is on a set schedule. It shouldn’t be cloudy today.” He said, his voice having a hint of a tremble. He sounded the most upset I’d ever seen him.  

The wind started to pick up outside. In seconds it went from just being cloudy and overcast to heavy raindrops hitting the window. A burst of thunder boomed, rattling the windows. More thunder came and so loud it sounded as if it was right next to the house. Suddenly, the windows on the far side of the room exploded. Glass few, the larger pieces making it to the middle of the room while the smaller ones nearly reached us. The wind poured in, making it impossible to see. I raised my arm over my eyes trying to shield them from the wind and rain. Nick wasted no time and grabbed me around the waist to carry me out of the door. He slammed the door shut. 

The storm rattled the entire building. Nick took a hold of my hand and started to run down the hallway, but he wasn’t going in the direction of the stairs. We should get out of there, not deeper into the building. 

“Nick, where are you going?” I asked concerned.  

He stopped running, still having a grip on my hand to look around.  A lost expression came over his face. Nothing had changed about the mansion. And yet, he didn’t appear to know where he stood. The thunder made my fear levels spike after seeing my partner so disorientated.  

“I thought...” He started, still looking around trying to figure out where he ran. “I don’t know where I am.” 

Nick sounded scared. For the first time since we met, he actually sounded scared. In The Catacombs, Nick could get lost even while standing still. For some reason, the same thing was happening. I squeezed his hand ready to take the lead and get us the hell out of there.  

“I'm here. I won’t leave you.” I assured him and started to drag him down the hallway in the direction of the stairs. 

“Weak...” 

A voice spoke between the thunder and the sounds of windows rattlings. Lightning flashed through the windows, lighting up the dark hallway every few seconds. I didn’t see anyone, but someone else was here. I kept running, Nick’s hand in mine. We just needed to reach the door then deal with whatever was going on after. I heard the voice again right behind us between the sounds of the storm. The fear nearly froze my legs to the spot but I pushed through.  

My legs shook as we flew down the stairs. It felt like a miracle we got down them without tripping. As we hit the landing, I felt eyes on my back again. A hard stare filled with such hatred that made me stop moving. My body refused to even move a muscle. Nick felt the same. Neither of us could move as we heard footsteps coming down the hallway and stopping at the top of the stairs. Finally, I forced my head to turn to see what we were facing and wish I hadn’t.  

At least it wasn’t a ghost. Whatever it stood at the top of the stairs, it was clear we couldn’t win in a fight. I looked up to see the monster staring down at us, face in a snarl and eyes narrowed. Its body was large and shaped almost like a cat. It covered in dark feathers, darker than the night. A set of wings pressed on its back twitched and otherwise would have blended in with the other feathers. A whip-like tail with a long trail of feathers dragged along and spilled down the first few steps. The neck was oddly long, with a human face staring at us through the feathers surrounding it.  

Taking one step down the stairs towards us, a pair of sharp claws clicked against the marble.  

“Look at how weak you are. Being dragged along by a human...” It hissed, a voice so dark and angry I didn’t think possible. 

“I thought nothing could get past the barrier...” I said, my mind almost blank with fear. 

“I made the barrier!” It yelled, body curling in rage.  

The beast leapt down the stairs. At the last second, Nick pushed me out of the way. He unable to draw his sword as the monster fell on him. He raised his arms to let them take the brunt of the slashes from the monster’s claws. The thing literally ripped The Orchestra away from him, the sword skittering along the polished marble flooring. 

“Fight back! Show me your strength!” The voice was louder than the storm outside and echoed through the room as he continued the brutal attack on Nick. 

I got up to try and pry the thing off of him. That was a mistake. It turned to face me, its mouth getting longer until it went all the way down its neck and nearly halfway through the body of feathers. The beast almost in two pieces because of that long mouth. I paused, stunned at the sight. It could have killed me, but instead it just knocked me aside so hard I thought I heard a bone snap somewhere when I slammed against the floor. 

That was enough to get Nicks attention. He kicked the monster off of him. Standing on weak legs and bleeding from where he had been slashed, he reached down to the sword no longer at his waist.

An odd expression came over Nicks face. One I never wanted to see again. Smaller objects in the room started to slide ever so slowly closer to him. His hair started to turn a darker shade, and I felt terrified. My partner snapped and using that strange power he let slip before. That stone state I hated. But this was dangerous. He might absorb everything around him, and I didn’t know if I could snap him out of it this time around. I needed to do something.  

Glancing over, I saw The Orchestra being drawn into the pull. I forced my body forwards to snatch it up just as Nick moved towards the creature not looking like himself. What happened next so unexpected, it made me stop and forget my pain to watch.

When Nick touched the creature, some feathers burned, but only the top layer, The monster turned its flexible body to face him. Grabbing Nick’s head in one claw, he slammed it down into the floor, breaking apart the marble. I cried out for my friend while clutching our only weapon. Whatever this monster was, it was way stronger than Nick. I didn’t want him to lose control again but I didn’t want this.  

Again and again, it slammed his face down and I tried drawing the sword in my hands. The Orchestra stayed stuck from fear.  It was like the time when we faced the other dark creature during the cult case. I silently begged the sword to fight with me to protect the most important person in my life. The creature finally stopped its attack and it let out a yowl of rage. 

“Weak! Weak! Alabaster gave his life for something this weak!” It screamed in fury. 

I had enough. A light vase had been thrown across the floor. I picked it up in a rage and tossed it at the monster, shattering it against its face but not doing any damage. I hated this thing for not just hurting my friend but also insulting him. After everything Nick had went through, how dare it call him weak. My face flushed from just how angry I was. 

“Don’t you dare call Nick that!” I shouted back. 

Before I could blink, the monster got face to face with me. Dark eyes stared into my very soul as all words in my mouth faded. Even if The Orchestra had started to cooperate, I couldn’t move my hand. The hot breath of the monster ruffled my shirt as it raised two front legs to wrap claws around my waist. 

“If he is not weak, then show me.” It hissed. 

I felt as if I started falling as everything went black. I couldn’t feel my body as I floated in that neverending darkness towards something I couldn’t see. I could feel that monster next to me, but wasn’t able to see it. Time had no meaning as I drifted, and then a feeling of fingers prodding came. I couldn’t feel my chest, but it was as if a set of hands were gripping my heart, then moving up towards my skull, inside my body that I was no longer a part of. I struggled, mentally pushing them away but failed.  

That thing found what it was looking for and painfully started to rip out sounds and images. So many flooded around they all muddled together in a flood. I silently screamed feeling almost violated for the hands taking something from my head so forcefully. As the images evened out and the sounds lined up, I realized what the creature was looking for. The bastard was sorting through my memories of Nick. 

It stayed beside me, watching moments in no real order. I could feel the rage building as we watched.  

“Weak, just weak.” The voice was hissing. It despised the fact that Nick got overpowered on some cases.  

It hated how he gave a small smile at times, and fumed over his kindness towards any supernatural pet he picked up. Our private conversations were on display and they disgusted the monster for how normal they all appeared. I saw a flash of a memory when Nick first smiled. I wanted to see it again and it came back for a few seconds. That surprised me. Maybe, just maybe, I could control some of this. It could sense my efforts but it was so focused on watching through my memories to really notice. I knew I didn’t have much time left as some memories started to repeat. An idea came to mind and I pushed on it. If this creature could see my memories, then maybe I could stall it and see theirs. It mentioned someone named Alabaster, so I gathered up all my strength and pushed on that. By the time the creature noticed what I started doing, it was too late. It let out a yell of shock and fought back in vain. I started falling again, but this time into the creature’s past. 

Instead of watching what happened, I pushed myself so far, I landed in the creature’s body feeling the past. We were sitting in front of the door of The Catacombs looking at a man with his back turned. His hair long and golden, nearly sparkling. Dressed in ornate robes, he would have been an impressing figure if his shoulders weren’t slouched. 

“What are you attempting?” The monster asked the man. 

He didn’t turn around to speak. Instead, he placed a hand on the ornate door. 

“I’ll make the stone. I know I’m able. I need to bring her back...” His voice sounded so strained it tore at my chest, and the man almost sounded like Nick.

“Making the stone is not a test of skill. Alchemy requires sacrifices. Most Alchemists are able to create a stone but they cannot afford the exchange to use it. Not even magic can bring the dead back. It may be possible through your means but are you willing to sacrifice everything for this goal?” The creature asked, sounding like a concerned friend. 

“I do not have anything left.” The man corrected.  

As the memory faded and he walked through the door, I knew this would be the last time this creature saw Alabaster alive. As he watched him leave, the creature had one thought play in his mind. ‘So, I am nothing.’ 

It hurt. It hurt to know this monster would have given anything to the Alchemist but unaware of it himself.  

The next memory that came was the monster breaking down the door to The Catacombs years later in a frantic pace. It hurt itself gravely by smashing through the spells keeping the door locked. And yet it still burst through. Pain exploded through his body as he slammed into the glass panel floor crashing down below and onto the hard stone flooring. He put the pain to the back of his mind as he flew down the swirling steps with only one name racing through his mind. He couldn’t explain it, but he knew something had happened to the Alchemist. His body burned from the effort and yet became overshadowed by the dread in his chest.  

He didn’t even pause at the bottom floor. Another door with a spell  blocked his path but he slammed his feathered body against it until it finally broke. A voice echoed through the dark stone pathways, and for a while the creature was unaware he started calling out for his friend. Finally, he found the sight he dreaded most. 

He found the man who he respected the most, on his back in the middle of a large and nearly empty room. His face covered by a white cloth and his hands were folded over his chest. His blonde hair spilled out around his body, stained with dark blood from the sword sticking from his stomach. Alabaster had been dead for at least a day, if not more. The creature sank to his knees, a flood of emotion he had never felt before nor understood overtook his mind. 

The creature shifted to a more human shape so he could take Alabaster into his arms. He refused to leave that man’s body behind to rot in the dark Catacombs. He didn’t know why the Alchemist was gone, or who covered his face but yet didn’t remove the weapon that killed him. Through his emotions, he could sense eyes on the scene. Glancing over, he saw the reason why the sword wasn’t removed and why the body was left where it landed. A child looked at them through a doorway. The creature knew Alabaster created a stone, and yet it felt imperfect. Instead of grief the creature grew angry. That emotion fluttered out simply because he was far too exhausted and hurt to fuel the rage. 

The stone may be imperfect, but the power it held would be dangerous. Turning away with dead weight in his arms, he looked over to the boy staring back. 

“You should rot down here. You are something that was never meant to see the sunlight.” 

The creature left, carrying the only person he ever respected and left behind the final thing the Alchemist created. In the end, Alabaster was buried in an unmarked grave in the middle of a field where golden flowers grew.  

I suddenly got forced out of the creature’s past. I ached from the experiences just as much as he did. We both were next to each other in the darkness as the most important memories we owned played back. Mine was Nick’s smile, and his was Alabaster’s face grinning in the sun. The man's hair shorter looking a bit younger. Alabaster looked a lot like Nick. His eyes and kind look were the same.  

Over the years, the creature was unable to get past Alabaster’s death. When he heard about Nick being alive and above ground, he started looking in from time to time. A hatred started brewing. He may be able to heal over his friend's death if it meant something. But Nick did not live up to his expectations. In his mind, the man he was loyal to died for nothing. I wanted to correct him, but I heard something snap.  

I was back into my body so forcefully I gasped. My head swimming, unable to get back to the moment. The monster moved away and towards Nick. I knew he wanted going to finish the job. I refused to let that happen. My body moved before I felt aware of what I was doing. As it brought down a massive claw, I got in front of it on my knees, scabbard of The Orchestra raised to take the hit. I hoped the sword would forgive me. 

“Don’t take it out on Nick because you miss your friend!” I shouted, my arms feeling as if they broke from the recoil. 

It paused at my statement looking even more disgusted than before.  

“I’m a beast! I do not have any friends!” 

The voice echoed again through the room, the storm hitting the mansion so hard to rattled the building and broke windows throughout the house. As the echo faded, the words started to sink into the monster’s mind. It didn’t have any friends. The one he did have died. It was a fact he knew, but didn’t accept until he finally spoke the words out loud. The claw started to fall back to the ground, and the monster’s face shifted back to an almost human-looking one. It sat like a cat, its long neck drooped and face looking towards the ground.  

“I do not have him...” He spoke in a low voice, unable to stop the flood of emotions that came with the realization. 

The creature that could have killed us both, and nearly did so, started to tears form in his eyes. Not making any effort to wipe them away, they fell onto the marble floor as the storm outside died down. Carefully, I placed The Orchestra down and took a chance. I got closer without any reaction from the creature until I could able to reach out and let it cry onto my shoulder. When he noticed what I started doing, he broke down fully. The claws grabbed at my shoulders, cutting into my shirt and my skin, but I didn’t move away. The monster openly sobbed over losing a friend so many years ago but never dealt with the fact until then.  

I should have been angry at it for hurting Nick so badly. But I knew he could forgive this creature so I would try my best to do the same. After a while and ruining my shirt, the creature calmed down enough to pull away. He still hung his head, eyes red from sobbing.  

“What’s your name?” I asked finally. 

“Mage...” He answered weakly, a single nail digging into the floor looking miserable. 

“I understand you’re upset, but you can’t blame Nick. What was Alabaster like? Do you think he would approve of you hurting something he worked so hard to create?” 

Mage started to dig into the floor harder, looking like a child that got grounded. He started muttering to himself trying to justify his actions and I couldn’t hear what he was saying. 

“It's not fair.” He grumbled. 

“No. Death isn’t fair. But you shouldn’t take it out on others because you’re upset.” I said carefully.

Again, he started to mutter as he stood up to pace. I took that chance to go over to Nick and see the damage. He got knocked out and his face bloody, but not as bad as I feared. When he was being attacked it seemed like he had gotten it much worse. The creature watched and huffed. 

“That child is still weak. He has power that he cannot control and shall bring the end of the world. It is in the wrong hands. You are only human and cannot protect him. If I kill him now, I may be stopping an apocalypse.” Mage said and it wasn’t anything I hadn't heard before. 

“I’ll protect him.” 

It such a simple statement it made Mage stop. I held so much belief that no matter what happened I would always stay by Nick and get him out of tough spots like this. I refused to let anyone kill him out of fear of what he was, or to keep using him. Dark eyes looked us over, trying to decide what to do next. Finally, a long sigh came from Mage and he started to turn away.  

“I shall fix up the barrier. It started to get weaker and we cannot have others finding this place. I’ll keep watch over this child and yourself. Prove me wrong. Show me how strong you are or else I’ll kill you both.” 

He talked a big game after crying on my shoulder and soaking my shirt. I let myself smile and it made him stop, confused.  

“Nickie looks a little like Alabaster, don’t you think?” I asked, implying that if the creature really saw how similar they looked he wouldn’t be able to go through killing someone who wore the same face as his friend. 

All his feathers started to stand up and his face flushed at the implication.  

“I'll kill you both!” Mage yelled an empty threat and quickly scurried away before his image could be further ruined. 

Somehow, we’d survived the encounter. I sat Nick up so I could clean his face off and look over his wounds. They were slowly healing which was a good sign. He finally started to come to after Mage was long gone. He tried to stand up, convinced there might still a monster to fight. Unsteady on his feet, it took me a few minutes for him to understand everything was fine.  

“What happened? Why did it leave?” He asked, still not understanding. 

He looked over my torn shirt wondering how I made it out alive.  

“We talked it out.” I admitted. 

"Huh?” 

It wasn’t often that monsters just left after attacking someone and then having a chat. I needed to explain it all to Nick again and assured him Mage just acted out because he missed Alabaster. People tended to calm down after a good cry. I wasn’t certain if Mage would be back but I felt as if he might not try and kill Nick again. At least not for a long while.  

“People act weird when they miss someone.” I said with a shrug. 

Nick stared at the floor and the damage Mage had done. He wasn’t angry at the creature for barging in trying to kill us. Mage might have been watching Nick for a while and getting angrier when he didn’t act the way he wanted. I wanted to ask a bit more about the Alchemist that created Nick, but decided it might be too raw of a topic.  

“Is it wrong that I also miss him?” Nick asked in a voice so low, it was as if he was speaking to himself. 

Whatever relationship he had with Alabaster; it was complicated. 

“He acted like a father to you, right? Of course, you’re going to miss him.” I assured my friend thinking back to my sister. After everything, I still loved her and that hurt. 

Nick nodded and didn’t want to continue talking about the man who long since died. The whole ordeal overly emotionally exhausting for us. Nick offered to let me stay overnight because he doubted he could make the spell to send me home until he rested more. I wanted to stay either way to watch over him just in case. And there were plenty of rooms I could use.  

“I do apologize for dragging you into such a personal mess. I feel as if I’m always burdening you with my problems.” Nick admitted. 

I looked up at him confused about why he would think that or feel upset over it. 

“Nickie, I don’t mind helping you out. You're like the brother I never had. I’m not going to abandon you.” I said, thinking that would be obvious. 

It was not. His reaction something I wasn’t expecting. I didn’t even think he had it in him. Nick stopped walking, his mouth slightly open trying to say something but no words came. I felt panic rising as his eyes started to get misty. For a second, I thought I made another person cry that day. He held it back, but placed his forehead on my shoulder after I gave him an long awkward hug.  

“I would like to think that if any of my siblings lived, that they would be as kind as you.” His voice was muffled and I needed to hold back tears of my own. 

Nick had lost so much, that he had earned being held for a few minutes. I wanted to be able to do more for him. But then again, I doubted he had anyone else who he could open up with. 

After he collected himself, he got to work getting cleaned up. He treated my minor cuts and gave me a new oversized sweater and sweat pants to change into. Making dinner cheered him up a little. I ate as he cleaned up the broken windows even though I offered to help. A bedroom was spared from the broken windows so he let me use that one for the night. I felt exhausted and yet couldn’t sleep. The events of the day playing back in my mind as I stared out the window and into a dark sky of countless stars. 

The bed so large that I didn’t understand why it was necessary. I could spread out and not reach the other side. As comfy as it felt, I couldn’t get settled. When a noise came from the door, I shot up expecting a monster or a ghost. Instead, Nick stood with a blanket and a pillow in hand. He didn’t even need to ask. We would both feel much better if we stayed in the same room for the night. Being the weirdo he was, he stayed on the floor even though we both could be on the bed and not even take up half the space. He did not back down about sleeping on the floor. I got tired of arguing and dumped all the pillows and blankets off the bed. Confused, he watched me make a nest right next to him. 

“It can be like a sleep over. Do you know any scary stories?” I asked once I was settled in. The mountain of blankets made being on the floor not so bad. 

“I think most of the cases we work on are scary enough.” He said while staring up at the dark ceiling. 

I let out a laugh, then let my mind wander. Why did Nick still work for The Corporation? Surely, he could figure out a way out of it. After everything they put him through he earned a different job.  

“The Corporation is terrible for you. Can’t you do something else?” I asked him yet again, hoping for a better answer.

“It’s not too bad. I can help people and I met you.” Nickie replied and I thought I could hear him smiling. 

That was right. If he wasn't an agent we never would have met. They did treat him like an object to be used. They took parts to test and saw him as a danger. And yet, he only saw the positives. Somewhere, there was a little girl enjoying her life because I accepted his job request. And a ghost laid to rest. And so many other things that came from solving some cases.  

And yet, I felt as if something dark was coming. As if we wouldn’t be lucky forever. Mage could have decided to not walk away today. Our next case could always end in one or both us use dying. In that moment, I didn’t want to leave anything unsaid. 

“I love you, Nickie. Aside from my nieces and nephew, you're the only family I have left." 

Reaching over I wanted to take his hand to make my point even more clear when it touched something hard. I frowned looking over at him. 

“Why do you have The Orchestra here?” I asked as the sword rattled in its scabbard. 

“I didn’t want it to be lonely without us.” He admitted and it was such an in-character response I laughed.  

No matter what, I was going to protect the hell out of him. At this point I think if God tried hurting Nick, I would go down kicking and screaming for him. Nick fell asleep pretty quickly. He needed it after days of stress. I thought I hear Mage prowling around looking for scraps in the kitchen. At least he didn't turn out as dangerous as he first appeared. We would need to walk on eggshells around him, but I guessed Nickie might have a new room mate for a while.

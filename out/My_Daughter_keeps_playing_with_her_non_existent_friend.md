Hello my name is **Mark**, I am 35 years old and I am married to a beautiful woman.. lets call her S. Me and "S" have a 5 year old child named "Katherine". Katherine is the only child in my family but we are soon to be having a baby boy in 5 months time.. Katherine is a very sweet girl, but yet so playful ðŸ˜…, but one day... she started acting a *little* to ***creepy*** for me and my wife to withstand.

&#x200B;

You see, Katherine like's talking to herself most of the times because well... she is the only child, but we have a house help that is very kind and plays with her a lot, so that Katherine doesn't become sad and all... but one day it was 12:00am and I still scrolling through r/nosleep on reddit. When I started to hear Katherine talking to "herself" but, the conversation was kindaaa... scary to me.

&#x200B;

"Mommy and Daddy are a sleep now, we should probably go **chock them to death if that's possible..** well, maybe not cause they lock their room to there bedroom when they sleep, but we'll get them next time." Katherine said as sweat poured down my forehead. I was stunned about what she said. You might be wondering, how could I hear all this. well, My room and her room are just one wall apart from each other, so I can hear most of the things she says... ANYWAY back to what I was saying

&#x200B;

So, After Katherine said all that, I told my wife what happened in the morning and wanted to go ask Katherine about what she was talking about.

&#x200B;

"Katherine! could you please come here for a sec?" I said. "Sure dad!" she replied..

&#x200B;

"Hey my darling! how was your night?" I asked. "It was good" she replied

&#x200B;

"I wanted to ask you..." I said. "Go on..." she replied....

&#x200B;

"I heard you talking to 'someone' very early in the morning in your room, and who was that you were talking to? he/she doesn't seem very nice when giving you ideas on what to do" I said. "Oh! that's Mary, she's my friend. But, I don't remember what I was telling her. But Mary told me she died 5 years ago when she was just 7 years old, due to a house fire, and came here to live with us" said Katherine

&#x200B;

"Oh! that's interesting, but.. please be careful on what you two talk about.. sometimes it gets a little bit to scary for me and your mother to handle." I said "No worries dad! I gotchu" she replied.

&#x200B;

Later that evening, it was around 9:00pm and I was about to get ready for sleep, and then I overheard there convo once again... and it goes like this

&#x200B;

"Hey Mary, Daddy and Mommy know about you.. is it okay for them to know?" said Katherine  
and then, I heard it. **IT** sounded like, a dying voice, kinda like it wanted to say something but it was too static. but what I heard was  


"Kill them" it said repeatedly, over and over.

I was shocked, its like I couldn't move or see that well.  


"As you may wish" Katherine said in a very demonic way

&#x200B;

I quickly rushed and locked the bedroom door and after that, I heard Katherine asking for me to open the door, knowing that I know what they were saying (keep in mind my wife is asleep). I was telling her that mommy was sleeping, trying to get her away, but she kept banging the doory  


"What's that noi-" I hurridly shushed my wife. "*dont make a sound or move" I whispered.* "It's coming for you" I said. "hide! now!";

PART ? (sorry, the story is too long for me to finish)

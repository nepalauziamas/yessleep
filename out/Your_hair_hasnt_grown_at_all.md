Not really sure what sub to leave this in, but this one looked like a good option. Things have just been getting really weird, and in a way that people don’t know how to respond to, or sympathize with… so I can’t really talk to anyone about it.

Several weeks ago I noticed I needed a haircut, and went to a barbershop a few blocks from my home. I had been there only once before - they had done my last haircut, in fact. 

When I entered, I noticed the same barber was on staff - I had actually only seen this one barber working in this shop. He’s a very tall guy, and thin, with a long, pale face and dark, closely-cropped hair. If you google “A trip to the moon” (an old french film), his face kind of reminds me of that weird moon face, but if it were long and thin rather than round. 

I went in this time and told him my “hair’s been at it again” (I have social anxiety and say dumb shit constantly), and he smiled, seeming to remember me, and extended his arm to the barber’s chair. As I sat, I was already feeling weird and uneasy - he was smiling silently at me in the mirror, and immediately started kind of massaging my temples and gently twirling locks of my hair in his long, thin fingers. 

After an uncomfortable amount of time, he clamped his hands on either side of my head and fixed his gaze on me in the mirror. Calmly, but with a hint of joy, he said, “well well well! No… your hair hasn’t actually grown at all, I’m afraid. The problem here, my friend, is that your head appears to be shrinking.”

He massaged my scalp and continued to stare at me in the mirror. At first I though he was joking, but eventually just started to kind of freak out. It was suffocating to sit there in the chair, in silence, his long fingers grasping my head. Not knowing what to do or say, feeling scared, confused, and suffocated, I just wrenched myself from his grasp and fled the shop.

That next weekend, I went to a party, and one of my friends randomly started laughing at me, saying I looked “different.”

“Wait, what’s going *on* “ he kept saying, laughing and following me around. This guy annoys me sometimes, but now I started to feel really uncomfortable and actually left the party.

Several days after that, I arrive home from the store. I walk inside my home, shutting the door loudly, and set my grocery bags on the counter. Immediately I hear the door open behind me. I turn, shocked, and it’s the barber. 

I yelled, “What the fuck?” and started to back away, as he advanced toward me quickly and confidently. I stumbled over myself trying to back away, managed to turn and run down the short hallway into my bedroom, but he was advancing right behind me. I ran to the far corner of my room in a panic, not knowing what to do, but already the barber was upon me. Towering over me, he kind of hugged me with his entire frame and feverishly ran his hands over me, especially over my head. He grabbed my head and started sucking on it ravenously, all over my hair and scalp, making these moaning sounds. “Hmmm! Mmmm!” he seemed to say, running his hands all over me, seemingly trying to devour my head. 

I think I fainted, and when I became conscious again he was gone, I was alone in my room. The groceries were still on the table.

I write this not knowing what’s going on, or what to do. If I tell this story to anyone I know they just laugh, and can’t really give advice or guidance. I’m having strange, vivid nightmares. I’m scared but really just so confused. Thanks for reading

We lost contact with the mainland over three weeks ago. Radio contact went out almost immediately when the ice moved in. None of the electrical systems work. Our helicopter won’t start up. The men have taken to burning crude oil in barrels just to stay warm. No one has come to rescue us.

We’re going to die here.

Not exactly what I expected when I took a job managing an oil rig in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico. 

The recruiter sold me on the warm climate, high pay, and tranquil view. Now I’m shivering in the middle of a winter hellscape.

Sixteen days ago one of the roughnecks reported the first iceberg.

“Sir, you need to come to see this!” he shouted over the radio. “Never seen anything like it!”

I dropped my clipboard to the desk and left the comfort of my air-conditioned office. The day was a scorcher. Probably around ninety-five degrees, but I hadn’t checked the weather that morning.

A warm wind from the gulf swept across the platform and ruffled my shaggy mess of hair. A lot of men on the rig kept their hair close to the scalp, but mine was thinning and I hadn’t wanted to bring any more attention to it than I had to.

Once I reached the observation deck I saw a roughneck waving wildly. I picked up my pace and crossed the deck to stand beside the man. He handed me a set of binoculars and pointed into the distance.

“Looks like an… iceberg, sir,” he stammered. “An iceberg in the damn gulf. My eyes gotta be playing tricks on me.”

In disbelief, I held the binoculars to my eyes and peered in the distance. It was hard to make out at first, but as a high wave moved in the direction of the platform, my line of view became clear. There it was, massive and white, bobbing up and down smoothly in the choppy water. It was moving quickly in the direction of the rig.

“Son of a bitch,” I muttered under my breath. “How long ago did you see this?”

“It just kinda popped up,” the man said. “I’ve been scanning the horizon for the pickup tanker and the damn thing just burst out of the water.”

My mind reeled. I’d seen dozens of bizarre sights over the years. Abandoned ships floating in the waves. Pods of whales sailing below the water near the support structure. Flocks of sea birds so thick they blacked out the sun.

A huge chunk of ice floating in eighty-three-degree water was a first.

“Looks like it is heading directly toward us,” I told the roughneck. “Go inform the safety officers to expect an impact in about fifteen minutes. It doesn’t look large enough to cause any serious damage, but I want a maintenance crew ready to check for structural damage.”

The roughneck sprinted away from the observation deck and I headed back to the office. I needed to call the sighting into the mainland and prepare for potential damage repair. Life on a rig was far from normal, but that was more than I had ever prepared myself for.

As I reached my office and began to turn the knob, a cold breeze brushed the back of my neck sending a chill down my spine.

I flicked the light switch inside the door but the room remained dark. After a few more tries, I gave up and headed to my desk. Picking up the radio mic, I held it to my mouth and thumbed in the button.

“Delta Rig to mainland comm. Delta Rig to the mainland comm. We spotted an iceberg on our perimeter. Repeat. An iceberg is headed toward our rig. No damage expected but requesting an emergency maintenance crew.”

*Silence.*

I repeated the message but again received only silence in return. My eyes drifted down to the radio to see all of the interface lights dead and lifeless. My heart crept into my throat. 

In a panic, I pushed back from my desk and headed for the door. Just as I grasped the knob, the platform shook violently beneath my feet. The iceberg had hit. Much harder than I had expected. Only moments after the platform settled, two more reverberating shocks slammed into the rig.

Running as hard as I could, I climbed to the top of the observation deck. A cluster of men was gathered there looking into the distance. I was about to ask them what had happened but I looked into the distance too and saw it for myself.

Dozens of icebergs were drifting in the water around us. Maybe hundreds.

The horizon was a wall of steel gray clouds lumbering in our direction. A fierce wind scraped against my cheeks. Cold. Almost freezing.

The snow came later that night. Gentle flurries at first. Almost a whimsical sight. Dozens of crewmen stood on the deck and watched the soft white flecks fall to the deck. It wasn’t long before the flurries gave way to a blinding storm.

In our confusion, most of the crew hadn’t noticed the electricity stopped working. The head of maintenance found me on the deck and informed me all of our systems had shut down. When I asked why the backup generators hadn’t been initiated, all he could do was shrug.

His crew was working on it, but so far they had no luck.

I found our pilot on the helicopter pad and instructed him to fire up the bird and head inland for help. With great fear in his eyes, he told me that multiple attempts to get it started had failed. We were stranded.

Over the coming days, the snow piled in massive heaps across the deck. None of the crew had packed warm clothing and huddled under blankets in the crew barracks, shivering and watery-eyed. There was no heating system on the rig. Even if there was, the damn thing wouldn’t have worked anyway.

Nothing did.

Violent quakes had shaken the platform for days before unexpectedly ceasing. The falling snow made it impossible to see the ocean below, but most assumed the icebergs had passed us by. At first, I believed this too, but another crewman dashed my hopes.

I was sitting at my desk wrapped in blankets and smoking a cigarette when the old timer pushed his way into the office. Snow and the biting wind blew in behind him before he slammed the door. There was a dry cracking noise coming from outside.

“Do you hear that?” he asked, almost devoid of emotion. “The crackling and slamming noises?”

I nodded.

“Sea ice,” he spat. “I worked on a fishing boat in the Bering Sea for a few years. We can’t see it, but that is the sound of great slabs of sea ice breaking against each other.”

Food ran out a few days ago. We were due a restock shipment two weeks ago. I melt the snow to drink, but my stomach constantly aches with hunger pains.

There aren’t many of us left anyway. A few men jumped over the side soon after this started. We lost dozens to hypothermia. A handful died in a fire when a burning barrel of crude oil they were using to keep warm tipped over in their barrack. Burnt them alive.

The bodies are going missing too.

Some of the men still seem strong. No complaints of rumbling bellies. But their faces are blank, absent of any emotion. I have my suspicions, but what could I do about it?

My God, I want to live but I couldn’t…

One of the crewmen told me this morning they have seen… things flying through the heavy drifts of snow. I haven’t seen them myself, but occasionally I think I can hear something land in the thick snow above my office. The dull sound of footsteps echoed in the room. But then they vanish.

When the man left my office, I thought I could hear a scream pierce through the howling winds outside the door. I looked out but no one was there.

I was never usually invited to these meet ups, I was one of the unpopular kids. I was so eager to go that I never noticed any of the red flags. They had packed a lot more than I had. one of the other kids there, Jordan, had an unusually large black bag that stunk. Nobody mentioned it so I just ignored it, trying my best to impress them.

The first couple of hours nobody even said a word, I tried to talk to some of them but they would just give me that look that makes you think you are the weird one. I was trying my hardest to be cool, and failing miserably. I was getting bored so I turned to leave. But Jordan stopped me, said I had no idea how important I was. He said it without much emphasis on any of his words. It freaked me the hell out. From that moment everyone started socialising, I felt many eyes on the back of my head when I turned from the forest though.

I had never been so uncomfortable in my life. Then night fell upon us, as soon as the sun disappeared from sight I heard no noise for a couple of seconds, then it began to rain. I soon realised that in my excitement I forgot to buy a tent. But I wasn’t about to share a tent with one of these freaks.

When I told the most normal boy there, Max, that I had no tent he said his tent was big enough for 2-3 people. I was glad I didn’t have to share a tent with Jordan or Edd. As Max led me to the tent I saw a group of boys setting up bear traps, they looked odd however. Heavy duty and the tips had been coated in what looked to be blood. I had never been camping before so I just assumed that there were big bears around here.

I went to the tent and lay down, I quickly fell asleep…

I awoke to a strange chanting, I exited the tent and began to quietly search for the noises origins. The gaze from the woods felt heavier than ever. I saw the fire had been lit, I slowly crawled over to the campfire. And I saw everyone at the fire, the big black bag Jordan had packed was next to him, blood dripping out from the bottom.

I decided I should now run away, my fears ignoring my common sense. I tripped over and managed to trigger one of those heavy duty bear traps, miraculously I was not hurt. A group of 4 left the campfire and ran over to the bear traps. Carrying large knifes and even an axe. I ran to the nearest bus stop and saw a bus was arriving in 17 minutes, there was no time so I ran into the woods. As soon as I entered the woods I heard the one carrying the axe say “stop! Don’t enter those woods, Besides, the cykrakhu will take care of him”.

I waited 17 minutes in those woods, I heard wailing, stomping and the sounds of bones cracking. Even trees fell. The bus had arrived. And I got into it. And till this day the gaze from the woods still follows me.

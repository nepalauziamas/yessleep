My university was one of the many universities that have withstood numerous wars and other historical events before I was even born. It was one of many institutions that were symbols of independence, marked by many as important and was considered one of the best schools to attend in. Which was why I used my scholarship to attend this school so I could take accounting, my first year was during 2020. Boy, was it a year. 


During lockdown most students stayed at home instead of staying in the dorms. But in my situation, I couldn't and its all because I didn't have enough money for a plane ticket, and the stipend the school would give monthly wasn't enough for me to keep in more than three weeks. So a few dormers and I, remained in the dorms studying in our rooms.
The best thing about it was that I could still have a feel of the campus. Whenever I felt overwhelmed with the workload, and when I felt like I needed to take a breather, I would go outside and take a walk by the tracks until I felt relaxed, everything was fine. Until night down.

I'll be honest, I was always too busy to walk around for that long, I usually walk around on weekends, 4-5 o'clock, then back to the dorms.

And in some foggy night, I got hungry and there were 200 pesos in my pocket and so, I bought takeout and went outside my dorm room to go grab it. I passed down the field when I noticed a foggy thing resting by the waiting shed, where my food was waiting. But it definitely didn't look like a driver. It was a white unmoving figure, tall and kindof droopy if you really looked at it. I didn't notice it alot at the day. But every nightly errand I had it stood there. Silently watching me pass by the track field up to the shed. It was creepy, but it wasn't the only instance of fright I would feel.

A few months later and suddenly felt a heavy feeling from my unit. And I never noticed it, but there was a huge gash from the walls of the bathroom and it kind of freaked me out. I contacted the school about this, they explained that they would fix it sooner and that they would let me switch units if it were fine with me, and I agreed to it, which lead me to the next event that gave me the fright of my life.

After a few days of moving in to a new unit, I've noticed something rather peculiar. Everyday, as if it was a routine, strictly, at 9:30 in the evening someone would knock on my door three times and whenever I opened it, no one was there. I thought it was just some annoying student running through the halls annoying other students. I didn't want the paranoia to seep through me.

One weekend, I left to visit my cousins in Bulacan and I had my friend Gisa to spend the night at my apartment - It was only then that my suspicions were deemed true.

The next morning, Gisa woke up in cold sweat. The electric fan was off. There was no sign of electricity and so she asked on other students who lived among the dorms. All of which had electricity. She checked the electrical circuit breakers. What was terrifying was that it were all shut down.

A few days after that, I got back to my dorm.

I took a shower, the whole time I was in the bathroom I felt nothing but eyes glued on me. Once I finished, I went outside the bathroom and dried myself up. And as I left the towel by the drying rack - that was when I heard it.

As if breathing heavily down the nape of my neck a voice seemed to breath a deep and chilling sigh. I felt all the hairs in my body stand up and I couldn't do anything but deal with it until I have enough money to move out of the dorms.

The same 9:30 door knocks, the heavy eyes in the bathroom, the electrical circuit breakers all off and even loud banging of objects became an everyday occurrence to me. It didn't feel safe in the dorm anymore. And later on, something would wake me up in the dead of night. Waking and shaking me up no matter the time.

Soon enough, I got tired of the occurrences and decided to move out. I moved out to a different room to another dorm building and I've never had the same experience anymore. I am thankful but to simply even type this out was stressful. I hope that anyone who reads this is safe from any evil entities that love to play and meddle with people.

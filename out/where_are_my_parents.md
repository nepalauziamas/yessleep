10 days ago my parents/dad and mom left for a business trip that will only last 5 days. We'll it's been more than 5 days and they aren't here, the last thing they said was "if we don't come back head to this location" I thought it was a joke. After the left I had a blast I had friends over and partied.

That only lasted 3 days and then that got boring. I called them and checked there location. They don't answer and they had there location off. Which was odd since they always had it on. The paper they gave me had rules which had the usual that they always give me when they go out. "Don't party etc etc" my dad on the other hand gave me a letter which I hadn't opened thinking it was the same bull. Well that took a turn because it said the following.


"Jack, this isn't a normal business trip nevermind you don't need too know that. 
Look If we take more than 5 days to come back head to 
The forest where we live.
If you don't find anything leave and never comeback."



Well, after reading I got bored and left to go to the forest as the usual I found nothing so I left. Not surprised I found this as a unfunny prank my parents are doing. So head to the police station report them missing.

I went back to the forest sounds dumb but I don't care either way. Well I found something the main reason the whole reason I made the report. They were kind they hugged me I felt some anger for leaving me like that. My dad was something else his eyes were wide open it's like he's seen something, no something disturbing, my mother was fine but my dad just looked at me with tears he said he needed to talk to me about sex and stuff which my mother let us alone for a father and son talk. My dad said to me nothing about doing the dirty he just said "help me, that's not your mother" I laughed he sounded dumbfounded.

But. Something made me think it was real for what he said. So, I went back to the woods and went further 1 than the last time I went there. Why I'm going back too the woods. My dad told me too"1.  he scolded me if I didn't.  


I saw it my mother's dead body. "Jack?" My mother is behind me.
My dad was telling the truth. "Yes mom" I said "let's go home" said my mother. But not the real one. 

I woke with no one surrounding me nobody was here just me and my mother. A letter from my father saying this.


"Jack, do this EXACTLY how I say it
Every midnight take a cold shower with no light and a candle on the sink covering the hole in the sink. After blow the candle and lock all doors. Open one window in your room but lock all the rest then put the candle on the bedroom floor if the candle lights up leave your bedroom from the window and run to the nearest house and stay THERE. Don't worry your mother won't be there at that time."

I thought this as another joke he made. So I did not do any of this. I sat down on the couch and fell asleep thinking it was all a dream. "Jack" a tall woman with a long smile and long dark hair skinny enough to fit in a vent.

 

Kira looked in the mirror, while thoughts swam through her head. Picking at her skin and lips with dissatisfaction. Dozens of magazines covered her desk, slim, clear skinned, beautiful women posed staring into the reader's soul with lust. The blessed, Kira would call them, the gifted. These women were given the gift of perfection. They were everything Kira, and many others strived to be.

Kira was pretty, she has had many partners in the past. But she would never be a magazine woman. Kira's face wasn't defined enough, her eyes were not big enough, her lips were not filled enough. She couldn’t get surgery, it would be unnatural, she would be a fake. People would see the desperate little girl who just wanted to be pretty enough. Kira's mind pointed out every flaw. Everything that *needed* to be fixed.

Over time, Kira's jealousy turned to rage. She would see many people with wonderful features. A girl had a pretty nose, but hideous eyes. One had wonderful lips, but her face was dotted with pimples and zits of all kinds. They would never be perfect, they would never be seen in a magazine. Kira had a wish, she wished she could have these features, and melt them together into the perfect, most beautiful face the world has ever seen. The want, no, the NEED to be fixed yelled inside of her. 

There was one girl that I had mentioned before, the one with the beautiful button nose? She would flaunt her looks regularly. How all of the boys in town loved her. Kira was tired of it, the real blessed people would never say a word about their beauty, because everyone who has ever laid their eyes on them already knew. Kira despised her, she would steal that nose right off her face if she could, and she would soon enough.

There was a chance and she took it. She found herself alone in the room with the girl with the nose. If you're wondering her name, then Kira sadly couldn’t tell you, people like her didn’t deserve names. Names are for pretty people, and while this girl had pretty features, her insides were disgusting, and we would find out literally soon enough. 

Alone in the room the girl flaunted her beautiful skin, beautiful eyes, and beautiful nose. She called Kira a whirl of names, nasty ones. Calling her a whore, a pig, dirty and disgusting. Kira was at her limits, Kira broke. They always said ladies shouldn't start fights, Kira guessed that wasn't true, she kicked and punched till the girl was on the floor. But Kira couldn’t stop, she let the emotions take hold, this was only fair, isn’t it? Blood dripped from the girl's mouth, bruises on her skin turning a nasty green and purple. 

The girl's screams were quiet, she didn’t have the strength. She laid there bloody and bruised, quietly weeping away her beauty. One last jab to the stomach made her shut up, close her eyes, and fall into the endless sleep that we call death. 

Most would believe that an act such as the one Kira had done today, would fill you with emotions, whether it be excitement or guilt. But Kira couldn’t feel, still left with the emptiness in her heart. She hadn’t done anything, she had only gotten rid of another useless, ugly, entity on this earth, she had given herself, and the world nothing.

As the girl's color faded Kira noticed, her nose laid untouched. A bit pale, but spotless. A simply wonderful, genius idea came to mind. Stuffing the girl into a garbage bag (how fitting for her character), she dragged her home. Once home she ripped her out of the bag and grabbed a kitchen knife. Holding her head in her hands, she slowly sliced at her nose, peeling it off showing the bloody flesh and veins underneath, disgusting isn’t it? Unbelievable that we’re all made of that just underneath our skin, I guess that would be one way to bond with each other, relating to the ugliness that we all share. 

Quickly placing the nose in her freezer, Kira stared at her inked red hands, how inconvenient, she thought. This could not be good for her skin, she quietly walked to her phone, and booked a pedicure. 

Later that day she remembered the nose in her fridge. She carefully removed the frozen body part and placed it on a plate on the table. Grabbing another knife, and sewing tools. Kira slowly, agonizingly removed her own nose, she would never dare to look in the mirror. She would vomit admitting what was underneath her. Taking a black thread, and sewing needle she carefully stitched on the new, more beautiful nose. It was like a drug, an empty happiness. The skin around her nose was inflamed, just a side effect, really. But she couldn't leave her face like this, it was uneven. Like an unfinished art project, Kira just needed a few more “donations”. 

Kira wouldn't call it a killing spree. It was more of a scavenger hunt. You get one girl alone, kill her however you would like, Kira enjoyed stabbing her victims. With a rough knife especially, it would be more painful, they could feel every single jab. Watching the blood and spit fall and drip from their mouths, Kira’s green, poisonous eyes being the last thing they would see. Then after freezing their skin she would stitch it over her face, making herself more beautiful by the week. Kira got better over time, getting more professional tools such as scalpels, and sharper and thinner sewing needles. Soon Kiras' face was stitched all over, all she needed now was one last girl to lay over her skin to hide the stitches.

She found her last donator, a girl with skin like porcelain, a perfect candidate. She called for her to come over, she soon heard the doorbell ring, with her victim standing behind it. Letting her in, she decides to take it slower this time, talking to the girl, admiring the skin that was soon to be hers. She finally pulls out her knife, sadly explaining that she would have to make a small sacrifice to the cause. Expectantly, the girl runs, Kira was fine with a chase, she wouldn’t get far. They run around the house, lapping over and over. As the girl ran downstairs she tripped, banging her head against the stairs below. When she reached the bottom her face was bloody and bruised, a large purple bruise around her left eye, it was horrible. Her face was ruined, it would never heal. Her chance was gone. Kira dumped the girl outside, she had given up, there was no chance she would find another girl like her. 

Soon enough, the authorities arrived, stuffing poor Kira, and her disgusting face into the back of the police car. I’m lucky, aren’t I? Kira was kind enough to send me these letters herself. I touched my left eye, it was still tender from my accident. I do wonder how long it’ll take for the purple to fade.



Hi there! So glad you decided to take up our babysitting position for £10.50 an hour! We’ve had so many sitters come and go and unfortunately you now have no choice in the matter.  we do have some rules, these are to ensure you’re entirely safe during your stay with little Timmy, if you don’t follow these rules EXACTLY you will come to your demise and become one of little Timmy’s ‘shadows’. Have fun! 

1.	Before entering the house you must make your presence known, knock five times stating your name and the reason for your stay, if it is not me or his father DO NOT LOOK THEY ARE NOT HUMAN. simply turn away and shut your eyes and count to thirteen or if you hear the door close turn back around and repeat the process till me or his father answer, however if you see it before turn away DO NOT MAKE IT KNOWN or you’ll end up like the others. 

2.	After passing the threshold close the door and avoid looking up the stairs or the door to the basement. you mustn’t leave this house UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES before 8am, put your phone on silent or any electronic devices you have and leave it on the table beside the door.

3.	At times you may see a tall figure standing in the door ways with glowing red eyes, if you do happen to see this, do not make it known and slowly walk to the living room and turn on the tv to channel 108.

4.	Call little Timmy down using the bell to the side of the door in all rooms, you will soon realise he does not look like a typical human child do not be alarmed or make it known you are and most important greet him as “Timmy the great” if you do not do this he will get very upset and you do not want to know what would happen to you if his ‘shadows’ sense him upset.

5.	Once you have greeted Timmy make sure none of his facial features change, if they do EVEN SLIGHTLY, say in a firm voice “time for a nap” this means one of his shadows is about to take over his body. 


6.	you MUST make little Timmy a bottle every 3 hours EXACTLY, this is not milk. Do not be alarmed when you see what liquid he requires. He loves the taste of his previous baby sitters.

7.	Ring little Timmy down and say “it’s play time” at 6:03pm and 3:03am bring his favourite toys out that are in the red box, do not be frightened by what they are, play the game “dolls house” and if he asks to play hide and seek politely excuse yourself, go into the bathroom and lock it for 2 minutes if you do not do this then you will not live to see the next day. 

8.	If you hear little Timmy laugh or talk to anyone other than you cover your ears and shut your eyes you do not want to hear or look at what he’s talking to or what he’s or they are  saying. 

9.	There is a family portrait in the dining room of me, his father and Timmy, look at it every hour and if you see something else in the painting LOOK AWAY IMMEDIATELY. It is watching you at all times.

10.	When you make it to the guest bedroom place your things on the floor, never on the bed or side tables and touch NOTHING other than the bed when you sleep at 8pm, the shadows do not like it when anything is out of place. 

11.	DO NOT LOOK UNDER THE BED OR IN THE MIRRORS you will not like what is staring back at you and if does not like to be seen unwillingly. 

12.	If you hear screaming at night turn on the night light to the side of you,  hide under the covers and count to ten, if you open your eyes and the room is either red or completely black then you are trapped. 

13.	Make sure ALL mirrors are covered by 7pm and always keep the tvs in the house on and do not look into little Timmy’s room uninvited. 

14.	If you are hungry in the middle of the night, bring the red candle and slowly head downstairs try to avoid looking into the darkness, open the fridge DO NOT EAT THE MEAT. You are welcome to anything else in the kitchen.

15.	If you get up in the middle of the night to go to the toilet make sure it is after 1am.

16.	If you see little Timmy in your dream, try to wake yourself up immediately. 

MORNING RULES 4am-8am:

17.	When it hits 4:09am you will hear the clock chime. Wake up and head down stairs ignore the woman sitting the front room she doesn’t do much harm unless you make it known you’re frightened by her.

18. At 5am make Timmy his breakfast in his favourite blue bowel, don’t cook the meat he doesn’t like it cooked, once done offer some to the shadows they like it when you’re polite. 

19.	When it reaches 7am play with little Timmy again and if he asks to invite his shadow friends and to play in the basement simply say “I am sorry Timmy but I am not up for playing anymore” pack the toys up and make him another bottle.

20. At 8am is when we come home, you will hear the door bell rings look outside and if it a not me LOOK AWAY, and if the sky is RED you will be trapped forever unless you pray HARD. After 5 minutes the door should ring again and it should be us and your stay is over. But not quite 

21.	Once you exit the house look no where but your car, the surroundings will be full of shadows just waiting to devour you if you notice them, and especially DO NOT LOOK INTO THE POND.

Thank you so much for looking after him! We hope to see you again soon! hopefully next time you might actually make it out alive.

I work in a fire lookout tower in a huge Hiking Park. I work in Tower 2, and my best bud Eric works in Tower 3.

I usually work the night shifts , and Eric works the day shift. For months now, there has been mysterious disappearances in this park, most of them during the night. I've been told to keep a close eye out at nights.

The park's officers have installed security cameras for me. They've instructed me to lock my tower's gate by the time it's 6:00pm for my safety. They haven't told me why yet though.

Now, I'm no conspiracy theorist or shit like that, but I suspect that the 'thing' behind these disappearances isn't exactly... Human. There's been an urban legend people like to tell. These disappearances have happened before in this park from what I've been told.


6 children, and 11 Adults have gone missing in 1989. People have speculated that an old mythical creature was behind this. "The Aswang". Witnesses report that a mysterious pale, grey woman, on all fours devoured them, but I say it's all shit.

Most people believe the suspect is Damian Handervaal. He has been found near a dead body in the northern part of the park. He has been deemed guilty, and sent to prison for 78 years.


I don't believe that he did it. Apparently, most of the dead bodies found have been cut perfectly in half, with their intestines missing. I don't believe that a HUMAN could kill 17 people in such a short time span, AND cut their bodies perfectly in half. It's impossible.


Anyways, that's enough banter, onto the actual story. Eric was finishing up for the night.

"I'm heading off for the night, good luck out there. Over."

"Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow. Over and out."

I go outside, and lock up the gates to the entrance of the fire tower. 

I hear a loud, ear shattering screech. It sounded as if a car tyre was rubbing against tar. I dash to the camera feed. Nothing, just a few campers, the occasional night-time hikers. Nothing out of the ordinary.

Suddenly, static from the radio.

"H-hello? Please help me! I- something's following me. Please help me!"

"Yes. Yes hello?" I reply paniced

"..." Nothing.

"Hello? Do you copy?"

"Y-yes. I'm here. Hello?"

"Yes, hello? Is something wrong? Over."

"Yeah, I hear something following me."

"Okay, where are you now? Over."

"Im- I don't know. There's a- uh. There's a small cave here."

I look over at the cameras.

"Yes. I see you. I need you to walk over the hill, next to the cave, and continue forward. Over"

"Alright."

A few minutes go by, I see him running past a few cameras, I observe him closely making sure that he's going the right way, until I spot something, I weird shadow following him.

"I'm going to fucking kill you." I hear over the radio.

"Excuse me?" I reply shocked.

"What? I didnt say anything."

"Don't play tricks with me. I'm trying to help you."

"I really didn't say anything! You have to believe me."

"Okay." I reply blankly.


.

"Hello? I've made it to a split in the track. I need your help."

"Alright, could you tell me where you are? Any landmarks? Over."

"I see... A sign. It says "beware, wildlife ahead."

"Okay, go left. That should lead to me. Over."

"Got it. Thanks."

A few minutes go by. 

"Hey. I see a fire tower. Is that you?

I go outside and shine my floodlights.

I hear another shriek. 

"What- WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT? DID YOU HEAR THAT?"

"Please calm down . I'm sure it was nothing. Did you see the lights? Over."

"N-No. There's an open gate though."

"Alright, go through them, and lock the gates, There's a lock on the gate already. Over."

"Okay."

A few minutes go by before I hear another shriek.

"HEY WHAT- THERES SOMETHING AT THE GATE."

"Okay sir, calm down. I need you to go inside, and lock the small gate and wooden door. Over "

"Okay."

I hear him lock the gate, I look over at Tower 4, I can see him frantically locking everything, and barricading the door. I see something crawl up to the deck of the tower.

"P-please help."

I hear static. I look over again at Tower 4. He's gone.

I hear static again.

"I'll find you."

"What?" I reply.

"Shh."

I hear heavy breathing through the radio 


.
.
.


"It's gone." 

"Okay. I'm going to need you to stay where you are until dawn.

"I- I'll try."

I quickly call the park officers to tower 4.

About an hour goes by. 


"Hello? I can hear something again."

"The park officers are coming over you're safe." 

.
.
.

"Hello? Do you copy?..."

No reply.


I hear static once more...


"It's..... In..."

There's a shriek. I hear a loud scream on the radio before... Silence.

"Hello. HELLO!? Please.. are you there?" I shout, paniced


I drop my handpiece.


I collapse onto my chair.

The park officer has tapped onto my channel 

"Hello, tower 4? Come in, tower 4."

"Copy." I reply blankly.

"There- there's a body. There's blood everywhere."

"He's gone. I tried to help him. It got him "

"Tower 4 what got him?"

.
.
. 

"Tower 4 do you copy?"

"Copy."


"What got him?"

"The Aswang. Over."

"Tower 4 stop kidding with me. WHO GOT HIM?"

"I told you. Over."

"I'm calling the cops, alright?"

"Yeah."




The next day, the body has been cleaned up.

Eric phoned me.

"Bud.. what happened in my tower."

"The Aswang." I reply.

"Shit." He replies.

"Yeah."



"I think I'm gonna quit."

"Yeah. Same." He replies.


He hangs up. 



5 months later, I'm still working this job. Yeah. Ironic.

I still feel.. off whenever I enter the tower, Afraid what happened to him, will happen to me.

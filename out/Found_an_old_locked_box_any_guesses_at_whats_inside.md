I was at the estate sale yesterday of one of my neighbors; he disappeared a few months ago unfortunately and just now was finally declared dead. 

Found a locked box there. There's no manufacturer name but it's rusted and looks ancient. They had it on sale for five dollars which is overpriced considering the agent doesn't even know how to open it. But when I shook the box I heard some rattling,  so I five-fingered it and will pay it back if what's inside is actually worth it. 

Any guesses on what's there or suggestions on how to get this open?  It's a three combination lock and it's about six by six inches in size. 

Update 1:

So I can't say what the neighbor did for a living because I think that would dox me, but I can say that he collected a lot of toys. Like trains, figurines, and building blocks.... might be giving my country away now but sometimes some people would set up something like a flea market near us and I think he'd even go and steal some from them lol. That's how much he liked toys. 

I was going to call a locksmith but you all have convinced me that it's not worth it. The box is very light so whatever's in there probably won't have much value except as a novelty. I want to move out of this tiny apartment but I guess curiosity will be its own reward instead. 

So the plan is now to put on a documentary, get nice and cozy, and start trying numbers.

Update 2:

Just unlocked the box! My fingers are stiff from rolling all the numbers, I got up to 666 before it clicked (the combo was 667).  It turns out what was in there was a doll. 

It's made out of wood so that's why it made that clacking noise before when I shook it. What's weird about this doll is that it has the face and body of an old man, and I can't move its limbs at all. And the expression on the face is angry; this toy isn't screaming 'fun', it just looks like it's screaming, you feel me? 

Maybe it was custom made because it does look like my old neighbor. If anyone can id this I'd appreciate it, there can't be many like this. 

I'm going to lie down for a moment and then wrap up the post, my own joints feel creaky from having spent so long on the couch. Can't believe it's already dark outside.  

Update 3:

Hey guys, 

I was going to take a photo but I actually misplaced the box. I'm searching the whole room and I just can't find it. I can't find the doll either. 

I opened the window for some fresh air but it's completely black. I can't see anything outside and it's freaking me out. I thought there was supposed to be a full moon tonight? 

And I know I said I wouldn't call a locksmith but I'm going to have to tomorrow. My front door won't open either. My apartment basically feels like a box, haha. I had some trouble with the handle though because my fingers are getting worse.  

My limbs are aching now too so I'm going to do some stretches as you guys suggested.

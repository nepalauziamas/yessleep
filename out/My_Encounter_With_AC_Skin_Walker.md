If you’re reading this, that means I’m dead. I’m typing this now in the closet of a umass frat house, bleeding quickly, fighting for my life. Before I go I need to document my story so this dosen’t happen to anyone else ever again. She’s close, I’m shaking, I don’t think I’ll make it. 

  It was always an interesting life growing up next to a college, as a high schooler I’d often sneak Into frat parties, I was always older looking so I’d fit in with all the college kids. This all changed one cold Massachusetts night. December 12th 2022. I had heard rumors of a red headed girl named Amalia, she was 5’4, 185 pounds, big nose, long, pale face. Not my type but I‘ve heard rumors she’s been giving out dome since arriving at college so I said fuck it I’ll go rizz up. Me being a horny 17 year old looking for head wound up ruining my life. 
      
At first the conversation was going great, I put forward some pretty good game, she was eying me up, till eventually she started feeling up on me. I was hyped thinking I was gonna get some play, boy was I ever so wrong. Things first started getting odd when she grabbed my hand and led me into a room, she said “I’ve never done this with a human before…”. The minute I heard that I should’ve known something was wrong, but I just assumed she was as a virgin, or she’s never given head before, so I was excited. We get into the room and all of a sudden things change. Her movements stopped being fluid and started being very robotic and outright creepy. 

She ran towards me, arms to her sides downwards at a 90 degree angle her knees going up very in high. I went to leave and she sped to the door, grabbed it and held it shut. She looked up at me, blood dripping from her eyes. “You’re not going anywherrreee”. This is when I was filled with fear, my body shaking and my blood gone cold. All of a sudden she begins to transform. 

Her back arches and lengthens, her face, going from ugly to uglier. Her legs somehow getting paler and going from fat and gross to freakishly long and skinny. Her period blood red hair fell out of her head, and her face growing longer and her eyes going all white. She was a skin walker. She reached out with a long powerful swipe, nearly disemboweling me. I had to grab the clothes that ripped off her to keep myself from bleeding out. I somehow got past her and found my way to a closet. I sit here now, pale from the blood running out of my stomach, with her pacing the hallways, smelling my blood. I hear her outside the closet. Oh god, I hear the snarling. She knows im in here. There’s all of a sudden a loud banging on the door, I could see the door holding on by a thread. I have no energy to do anything but sit here and type, I’m helpless, the skin walker has found me. 

The door is all of a sudden blasted in. I can hear the skin walker approaching, it sniffing, snarling ready for its next meal. Fear overtakes my body, “yahhh I’m gonna eat youuuu” rings through my ears, the voice so sharp and annoying my ears bled. This is it, I thought I was gonna get dome from a fat redhead bitch named Amalia, but here I am, about to die. All of a sudden, a flash goes off, all I can see is white. The ski walker is gone.


Hello, I’m currently writing this three days later at 11:45 pm from the nearest hospital, somehow I have survived my encounter with a skin walker, I recognize I’m luckier than most, I had to get a blood transplant due to the amount lost, and I have permanent eardrum damage from hearing that wretched creature speak, issue is the voice did not change from its human form. My life is forever changed, I will never be the same. 

All of a sudden, the door to my hospital room flew open, I hear a incredibly loud and obnoxious voice, “did you hookup with my fucking sister? Do you even know that I wrestle and hit 225???” It was Jon, his face was frightening, long skinny and an incredibly elongated nose. He tried to fight me but to my surprise my black teenager friend from paterson came to my defense. “Your sista was given out buns to my boy” he somehow fought off the 5’7 132 pound monster, and narrowly escaped with his life. I can truly say I am unlucky to be alive, I can’t go to sleep because I am haunted by my experience with the skin walker siblings

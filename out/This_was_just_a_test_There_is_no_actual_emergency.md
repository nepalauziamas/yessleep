"This was just a test. There is no actual emergency." All the radios, televisions, cell phones, everything capable of sending a signal has been sending that message for the past three days now, quite frankly it is starting to get into my head. Especially when you know the alert is probably some sort of government cover-up.  It began on Thursday, you know typical day. Wake up, open the curtains, get dressed, eat, and go to my 9-5 office job. I got off work and decided to take a nice quiet drive and turn on some music and relax. I drove down some back road and tuned the radio. A few minutes later, a news broadcast interrupts the music but it's cut short. After a few seconds of static you can hear the typical alert tones of the emergency alert system. "The emergency alert system has been activated. This is not a test. A psychological and physical danger warning has been issued for your area. If you see any suspicious persons or objects, call your local emergency services. This message will rep-" The message turned to static until another alert came through. "The emergency alert system has been activated. Sorry for any confusion or panic the previous message caused, this was just a test. There is no actual emergency. This message will repeat." Okay then... maybe some sort of human error happened and they issued the wrong alert. I can't lie, I was feeling anxious but I just went home, and jumped in bed and eventually fell asleep. 

I sleep with my phone under the pillow, so around 5 in the morning I got awoken by the intense vibrating and the phone's emergency alert tones so I sleepily looked at my phone. "If you live in \[REDACTED\] County, take shelter NOW. Do not look outside, do not go outside. Without making noise, gather food, water, and other necessary items and move to a room with preferably no windows. An evacuation order may be put into place once the situation is assessed and if possible. This is NOT a test." Reading that message while tired was a bad idea, mostly because I ended up throwing my phone and going back to sleep. When I eventually fully woke up, due to muscle memory from my routine I opened my curtains and looked outside, not remembering the alert. I fucked up because as soon as I looked out the window I saw some sort of slightly humanoid creature near one of my neighbor's house. The only thing was, it couldn't be human. It was completely black with a darker shade of black in it's... I don't even know if you could call those eyes. It scared the fuck out of me and so I fell back on the floor which made a louder noise than it should've. I heard the loudest, most ear splitting screech I have ever heard, followed by hordes of footsteps getting louder, which probably meant they were coming my way. I froze for a second and started to hear clawing and banging on my front door, but then got up and hauled ass. I grabbed my phone and I bolted upstairs, pulling the staircase to my attic down and climbing inside it.  I closed the attic just as I heard the front door break. I remember last year, I installed a mini kitchen up here so I could use my attic as an extra guest bedroom for my friends. So I have food, my phone and I think I have a charger up here somewhere. 

Okay It's Saturday now, and I forgot to mention my phone started blaring the "This is just a test, there is no actual emergency" alert again and I hear my TV blaring it too. I have a radio up here and I get the same message. Despite everything I still got some sleep but I hear voices in my head and I got a hallucination yesterday and even worse, I hear those things in my house probably destroying everything looking for me. I don't know if this is some government experiment gone wrong or a cover up, but I had no signal for the longest time but I managed to break through and get a bar to post this. I don't know what to do. If anything happens, the next time I get a chance to I will update this.

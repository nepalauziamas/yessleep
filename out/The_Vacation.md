I really shouldn’t be looking outside the train window. Mom and Dad told me it was a surprise vacation for a few weeks, but I’m just too excited. Every so often I can hear them snoring – that’s when I pull down my blindfold and sneak a peek. The meadows and wildflowers seem to zip by so quickly, while the ominous mountains move at a crawling pace.

I still have my new dress on. Mom and Dad gave it to me as a gift three days ago. They said they were going to wait until my birthday next month, but since we’re on this surprise vacation, they wanted me to have it now. I love it so much! It’s bright yellow with a floral pattern of daisies all over it. Mom said it makes my blue eyes pop like wild bluebells in a field of golden wheat.

When we boarded the train, I only took one suitcase with me. I could have changed dresses, but this is my favorite, and Mom doesn’t seem to mind. I don’t know why they don’t want me to see where we’re going, but Dad says it’s OK, and I trust him. We’ve been to a lot of stops, so I guess that’s why it’s taking so long to get where we’re going. Some of the passengers smell really bad.

I was able to sneak another view of the meadows outside my window. It seems like we’re slowing down again. All of these stops and starts make me nauseated.

As our approach slowed, we were told this is the final stop on our trip. Finally! It took a few minutes, but we finally got off the train. Dad had to hold my hand, because I couldn’t see anything. When I stepped off the train, I felt someone pull at my blindfold and take it off. I thought it was Dad, but when I looked up to see him, it was someone else. He was a very clean man; he had sharp features and dark, slicked-back hair. He asked me my name. “Ruth,” I told him. “How old are you, Ruth?”  “I turn ten next month.”

He smiled at me and looked into my eyes. It was not the kind of look Mom and Dad would give me – it felt like he was looking at my eyes, not into them.

“You have beautiful blue eyes, Ruth. They are the color of the sky. Azure, I think it’s called. Do you know that word?”

“Thank you, sir. No I don’t know that word,” I said.

“Please, Ruth. No need for the formal courtesies. My name is Dr. Mengele. You may just call me Josef.”

He gently took me by the hand. “Why don’t you come with me, Ruth? I have something special to show you.” 

I turned around to find Mom and Dad, but they were lost in a group of people. Then, I saw her – Esther. She saw me and started running over to us. 

Esther stood by my side. “Sir, I can’t find my Mom and Dad. This is my twin sister, Esther. Can she come with us until we find our parents?”

Dr. Mengele looked at the two girls – mirror reflections of each other. He grinned from ear to ear.

“Of course, Ruth. We can all go together.”

He took both girls by the hand and they walked into the void of history

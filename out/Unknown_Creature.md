(When I was around 11 years old I had a very unusual experience. Being 29 years ago I still remember it very clearly.)

One evening I had went to the local grocery 

store in small town south west Missouri with 

my mother and my grandmother. It was just

 a usual ride to town and being 11 years old 

it was quite boring, going to the grocery 

store with my mom and grandma. I always 

remember as a kid that it felt like ages

 before we would be back at home. Anyway 

on the way back home it was late in the 

 evening and the sun had just started going 

down so I could still see fairly well. Upon

 arrival at home my mom says “Trixie is out!”

 Which was a large female Rottweiler our

 family dog. I looked in the direction my

mom was looking and sure enough it looked 

like Trixie! This was as we were pulling into 

my childhood houses driveway which was

 across the highway from my grandparents

 place. So in a panic and thinking Trixie may 

see that we’re back home and run across 

the highway and get hit by a vehicle, I

 jumped on my bicycle and headed towards

 my grandparents house. It took me about 1 

minute or so to get over there and as I was 

coming up to where we had seen “Trixie” I 

noticed a very very large black creature! Not

 a dog, not a bear, I still have no idea what it

 was! So I locked up the brakes on my bike

 and slid sideways crashing to the ground. I

 watched as the creature looked directly at

 me then it frantically ran and jumped a 

fence (barbed wire) and ran off into the 

woods and I remember being so scared and 

getting on

my bike and racing back to where my mom

 and grandma were unloading groceries and 

told them about what I had seen. They 

didn’t know what  it could have been but

 Trixie was in the yard so they knew it wasn’t 

our dog. I know this story is probably dumb 

and I’m

 not a very good writer but I just wanted to 

share it 

and get it out there. 

I think we can all agree that there are

 creatures in the world that we don’t 

understand or 

know about yet. I am not claiming that it was 

Bigfoot…

or anything like that. I just feel like it was 

something that 

lives deep in the Missouri wilderness in the 

Ozark 

mountains that few have ever seen. I grew 

up taking 

walks in the very same woods I seen the creature 

vanish into, but never seen anything else like it again. 

There are numerous stories in this area of a black 

panther living out here or a family of big black cats but 

I haven’t seen any signs of them. I’m pretty sure that I 

could’ve recognized a panther. I have been in the 

outdoors hunting and fishing in Missouri my entire

 life and never have I ever encountered any such animal again.

Context: my grandfather recently passed, And I got his home this is where he died, I am 24 M. I am single with no relatives or pets at all, the only "pet" I have are a few spiders around the house. Now on the actual story, this year when I moved in completely, I noticed a few things moved around I just chalked it up as me being forgetful. but then I got a dog, his name is Milo the cutest little chihuahua so sweet too, but when I take him to the back room where my grandfather died to go sleep, he would just whine and bark at this one spot in the room. It turns out this is where my grandfather passed, and I thought nothing of it, or just maybe him smelling that spot and not liking the smell of death, but now 4 weeks later after the barking started, I noticed a shadow figure. Now this figure was about 5'6 (I am 5'9 I saw it and it was a bit shorter than me.) and it hasn't done much but I have seen it waddle around like my grandpa would before he very unfortunately passed. I have set up cameras outside because about half mile walk is a huge garden he planted, he loved that garden so much, and I've seen some rather strange things on the camera. Things like a 5'6 figure walking around it and watering the plants. Now when I went out there, there was a watering can half full on the ground almost as if it was recently used. I see this as a good thing because I bought a Quija board to see if he would respond to me. "Holy shit" is what I yelled out when it went to "K", "A", "I", now this seriously fucked with me because I didn't know if it was my mind, a demon/ghost, or my grandpa. I asked a few more questions only he would know, and he responded flawlessly, so I know it's him. However, something has fucked with me for a while now, my grandpa is 5'10 and died in the hospital. I don't know what the hell this thing is but whatever it is it needs to leave me alone. I've tried to get rid of it by using salt water all over the house and Holy water. Nothing worked I'm contemplating moving out with Milo or calling a priest over. I drafted this about 2 months ago and forgot all about it until one evening. The spirit/ghost/demon thing came back, it knows that I know it's not my grandfather. It left a mark on my leg it scratched me! and this is where I drew the line. I called a priest. The priest can't do anything because he can't find it. I think it's latched onto me I've moved most of my stuff out and moved into a new apartment for the time being, but the things keep happening. I think this may be my final post before it makes its final strike, it keeps throwing things at me in my sleep I can only imagine of what it is about to do... Please help me, I don't know what to do I think it may kill me soon. I don't want to die yet. Not by this thing. I think I'm just going to end this on my own. I'm going to hang myself and hope this madness ends. Consider this my suicide note goodbye.

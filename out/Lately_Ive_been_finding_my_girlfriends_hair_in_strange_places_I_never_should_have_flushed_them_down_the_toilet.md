Lane and I have been together for 2 years now. She's beautiful, sweet, and nothing like my narcissistic ex.  
We moved into the apartment last month. It was our first time living together, and it was great. I love waking up next to her. 






Lane has thick, waist length blond hair. It's soft and silky and smells like lavender. 

Before moving in together I never had any issues at all with her hair. 

We'd spent the night at each other's places many times and I never noticed anything weird or out of the ordinary. 

No build up of clumps in the shower drain or the kind of shit you hear couples complain about.  






But just a few days after settling in the new apartment I noticed her hair on my pillow. Just a few strands, nothing concerning. I only remember it now, but at the time I just plucked them up and tossed them in the toilet before I took my morning piss. 



Later that same day I was making a tuna fish sandwich and as I was mixing in the mayo, I saw a long blond hair curling around the fork. I tossed the tuna in the trash and didn't really think too much about it. Hair falls out every day. No big deal. 






When I went to brush my teeth before bed that night I felt a tickle on my tongue. I felt around with my finger and ended up pulling out a long blond hair covered in toothpaste. 

I figured it must have gotten on my toothbrush when Lane was doing her hair that morning. Again, no big deal.



I didn't think it was that important to tell her about it and just went to sleep with her in my arms as usual. 



I fell asleep peacefully to the scent of lavender but I didn't sleep long. I woke up a few hours later to a sharp pain in my testicles.  

I reached in my boxers and gently felt around, wincing at the stinging pain when I touched them. They felt sore. Like they'd been kicked or squeezed. 

I cowboy walked to the bathroom and pulled my boxers down to inspect the problem area. 




(Too much info, and I'm sorry but) My testicles were dark, almost a deep purplish color. 

And it wasn't just the color that was concerning. My testicles were swollen, almost double in size. 

I nearly fainted, but I made myself calm down and carefully checked all over for any sign of trauma or something. 

It didn't take long to find the culprit.  




A hair, more like 10, were wrapped around my testicles at the base, tight enough that they were clearly cutting off my circulation. I tried to rip the hairs but that just hurt more so I grabbed a pair of tiny scissors and very very carefully cut the hairs free. 



The relief was immediate. I sat on the toilet seat, letting blood flow again, and scooped up the hairs. 


I couldn't understand how they were wrapped so tightly around my balls to begin with. I've had hair in places it shouldn't be a few times in my life. Price of living with females. But never like this. 


I flushed the hairs and went back to sleep, cupping my sore testicles. 









In the morning the boys were fine, thank God. I told Lane about it over breakfast and we had a good laugh. Well, she did most of the laughing. 

She went to work and since it was my day off, I did some things around the apartment, like hanging a shelf and fixing the bathroom tiles that Lane swore were crooked. 



Around noon I decided to order in, and on my way to the kitchen for a take out menu, I felt a stabbing pain in my foot. Like I'd just stepped on a piece of glass. 

I hopped to the couch and checked my foot, but I was surprised to see there was no glass. 

I was even more surprised to see that instead of glass, there was a tiny piece of blond hair poking out of my foot, just below the big toe. 

I thought I'd pull it out with tweezers but even just being in my foot, without stepping on it, was painful. So I said fuck it and used my fingers to pull it out and hoped that the hair wouldn't break. 





Thankfully it didn't, but as that hair slowly slid out of my foot the pain shot straight up my leg. It felt like shoving a burning nail in my foot. I gritted my teeth and kept inching it out, determined not to leave it in for any longer than I had to. 




When it finally came free a drop of blood and white pus looking stuff, dripped down my foot and off the hair, a strand over 22 inches long. 

I just sat there gaping at it. I've heard of people getting hair splinters, usually pet owners, but we didn't have a pet and this 22 inch long hair shouldn't have been able to lodge so deeply inside my foot just from stepping on it. 


I couldn't understand how it happened. It made no sense, but I tried not to dwell on it. Crazy shit does happen. I flushed the hair, if only to keep it from blowing out of the trash can and winding up in my foot again. 









I guess that was the start of the problem. The real crazy shit, although I didn't know it at the time. 

But looking back, it was like the hair had a taste for blood, as fucking wacko as that sounds. 





I told Lane about the hair in my foot. How long it had been, and how deep it had been. She was skeptical, which I don't blame her for. Eventually she promised to brush her hair more carefully, and only in the bathroom. I thanked her for offering to make that compromise for me. I made a mental note to vacuum daily and figured the problem would be solved. And it really seemed to. Lane only did her hair in the bathroom and made sure to clean up any stray hairs after, and I swept and vacuumed every day.  

Nothing happened for a whole week. No hairs in my food, around my balls or in my feet. 








But yesterday shit got worse. 




I had to meet a possible client for lunch at a local restaurant. 

I hopped in the shower and was halfway through my rendition of Uptown Funk, while washing my hair when I felt a weird tug on my pinky toe. 

I ignored it at first and started rinsing the shampoo from my hair, but the tug got stronger, hard enough to actually crack the pinky toe's knuckle. Almost instantly I felt a tickle across the other four toes, followed by a hard tug on all of them. 

I looked down and didn't see anything, but as the water rinsed the soapy bubbles down the drain I saw what was tugging on my toes and nearly had a heart attack. 






Hair. Enough strands to fill a ponytail, had come up through the drain and curled around each one of my toes. 

It took me a minute to find my voice. I screamed and screamed, while simultaneously pulling my foot away from the drain. The pull on my toes was strong, like a damn vice grip. After a minute of trying to pull my foot free, I realized the hair wasn't going to break. I reached my arm out of the shower, attempting to get at the scissors in the sink's bottom drawer. 

Unfortunately for me I couldn't reach it. I was in sheer panic mode at this point. My foot was being pulled closer and closer to the drain, and my grip on the tub kept slipping. 






I knew my foot wouldn't fit down the drain but that didn't exactly calm my fears. 

As my foot reached the drain the hair just continued to pull, until I heard a loud pop, followed my a pain I'd never felt. 

I knew my ankle broke. I screamed in agony, and grabbed onto the edge of the tub with both arms and pulled as hard as I could. I felt the hair tugging and tugging on my limp foot, and just when I thought my arms would give out, the hair snapped and I went flying out of the tub onto the floor. 




I didn't stay there for long though. I scrambled up on my one good foot, ignoring the pain in my ankle, and watched in horror as that thick band of hair slithered back down the drain. Like a fucking snake. 




I didn't bother to shut off the shower, and sat on the toilet, panting hard, asking myself if that really just happened. My ankle was already swelling and there was a ring of torn skin around it. 



I called for Lane, annoyed she didn't hear my screams for help. But any thought I had was gone when I felt the familiar tickle. This time it was on my ass. 

It was so fast that I hardly knew what was happening. Mere seconds after feeling that tickle on my ass cheeks, I felt it enter me. I didn't even have time to scream before I felt it shoot up inside me like a bullet. 








The pain was worse than you'd think, but I managed to roll off the toilet into the floor. 

I cracked my head on the perfectly straight tiles, and saw stars. I could feel the hair wiggling up inside me and it was all I could do not to pass out from the sheer panic. 




I reached down and felt around my asshole, and thankfully there was at least two inches still outside, trying to work its way in. 


I grabbed it, pulling with all my strength, praying out loud that it wouldn't break. 

I could hear Lane calling me from the hall and beating on the door. I cursed myself for locking it and kept pulling. Inch by inch the hair came out, but whenever I'd let up just a tad the hair would shoot back in with force that caused a blinding pain through my ass and stomach. 

Lane was asking if I was ok, if she should call the police but I couldn't even answer. I was too terrified any movement would cause me to lose my grip. 

I was gritting my teeth so hard I don't know how they didn't break. 






I'd almost had it out when I heard Lane screaming. That scared me even more than what I was dealing with and gave me the strength to yank out the last bit of hair. I got to my feet, and held the wriggling mass of hair out in front of me. It curled around my hand, flopping and twisting in an attempt to get free. I didn't know what to do with it and didn't want to risk it getting away so I flushed it down the toilet again. 


I flung the door open, worried I'd find Lane hurt or worse. But she was standing in the hall, her face soaked with tears. 



"My hair!" She wailed, her hands clasped to her freshly bald head. 




We left the apartment as fast as possible. We're staying with my parents right now until we can find a new place. 

Lane is coming to terms with losing her hair, but she's still  beautiful. 

I actually prefer her this way. 




As far as her hair… we never did find it or how the hell this happened to begin with. 




But that's not why I'm writing this now or why I'm scared to death. 


You see, I woke up a little while ago with a burning sensation in my head and a bloody nose. I don't know for sure, but I think I'm in trouble. Because all I can smell is lavender…..

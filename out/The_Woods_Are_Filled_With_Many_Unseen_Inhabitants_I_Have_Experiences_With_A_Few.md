I have been around the woods my whole life. Whether it was family vacations as a kid, being a curious and adventurous teenager, being a park ranger, or doing search and rescue. The woods can be a beautiful escape in short bursts. But when you spend enough time in deep woods, you start to run into its hidden inhabitants, especially at night. I have a few stories that I think people may want to hear. I'll share some from when I was a teenager and some work-related ones. 

~ Around the age of 15, I was sitting in history class when the phone rang. My teacher answered and when he hung up, he told me I was being dismissed. I was confused, but when I walked downstairs to the office, I saw my older brother. He smiled and I knew we were going to have some fun. With him being the biggest woodsman in the family, with me taking second place, he brought me out into the woods so we could walk around. We started to venture deeper into the woods. It's like being in a house, the deeper into the house you go, the more of its true soul you will find. We came up to a small brook, and we were about to turn around until my brother spotted something on the hill in front of us. We crossed the water and made our way up the hill. It wasn't a treacherous climb as it wasn't steep. Up top was a crack in a rock. We shimmied our way to it as it was right at the edge, and we found that it was a cave. It wasn't a very big cave. In the middle were four big boulders in a square formation. We turned on our flashlights, and we noticed there was writing on the stones. They read, 

"Blood and Souls" 

"Feed Us" 

"Starving" 

"Death Approaches" 

Each one was written on the four boulders. So the Blood and Souls was written on one rock, Feed us on the next, and so on. The writing also seemed to become more and more illegible with each phrase. It was also written in dark red paint, or so we hoped it was paint. There was another small opening that we would need to get on our stomachs to fit through, but after reading the messages on the rocks, we started to feel insanely paranoid and uncomfortable. That quickly turned into the onset of a panic attack. We started to lose our breath and began to hyperventilate. We felt like we were being watched. Imagine what it would feel like being in a mall, or a school after hours, and security had seen you and you're trying to hide from them. Or being in an abandoned hospital that was haunted and you were there alone at night. That was the type of panic we were feeling. We then heard a loud animal-like screech or growl coming from down the smaller path. We immediately exited the small cave, and once we were back out in the open we instantly felt better, no more panic or paranoia, but we were not going back in. 

~ When I started my job as a ranger, I didn't experience anything strange or scary in the woods at first. It wasn't until the summer hit that the first horrifying thing happened to me. I got a call saying that I needed to go to a campsite. Campers were lost and could not find their way out so I had to go and guide them. This happened a lot, so it wasn't anything out of the ordinary. I arrived in the area and noticed it was an area no one had ever camped out before, at least not that I ever knew. When I got there, I didn't see anyone. I saw the campfire but it had been reduced to embers by the time I arrived, they looked like they hadn't been there for at least half an hour. I called out, but no answer returned. I jumped when I heard something heavy hit the leaves behind me. I turned around but didn't see anything. This happened to be in the daytime, so I would've seen if there was someone there. When I walked over to investigate the sound, I heard another identical sound behind me. This time I saw what it was, it was a heavy rock. I then heard Male laughter. I couldn't see where it was coming from, as I didn't see anyone in the immediate area. I heard a little pop, and it made me jump. I saw what it was. It was a flat stone that had broken in half. Someone had placed it in the fire, and it had happened to pop.

 While I was looking one way, I heard laughing again coming from my left. I looked around and saw a slight bit of clothing behind a tree, maybe a sweater. I walked over and charged around the tree. There was no one there. It was a sweater pinned to the tree, and there was a tape recorder playing the laughter that was also against the tree. On top of that recorder, was a piece of paper that read "Gotcha. Fell for it." I didn't even look around to see if I saw anyone, I just ran back to my jeep. I started it and went to drive away. I saw someone peeking around a tree at me. I drove up the path and looked behind me from where I saw that guy staring at me. Behind the tree, was a man. With a head on a big stick. The man holding the head was waving at me smiling. I stepped on the gas and when I arrived back at the welcome center I parked my jeep, and went home for the day. 

~ During Thanksgiving one year, we went to my aunt and uncles. My brother came with us, and after we ate, we waited until the sun went down. My brother looked at me and asked if I wanted to go into the woods behind their house. I of course said yes. We get about maybe almost a mile in, and we realize that we have no idea where we are. We very rarely got lost separately, together we should not have gotten lost at all. We started running because now we are getting nervous. We never seemed to make any progress back to the house. No matter which direction we ran, it felt like we just went deeper into the woods. At one point, I tripped and hit the ground. I get up and start to look around. I feel around the area where I think I tripped and I grab a stone. We didn't have flashlights, so I took my phone out and used the flashlight. It was a fucking cross. I stone cross. We start to brush the leaves away from the whole area, and some dirt and we start to realize we are standing in a backwoods cemetery. Graves surrounded us. We were weirded out by this. I have seen a few things similar to this before, but these woods weren't the type of woods you'd find something like this. I was looking at a grave when I saw a man standing by the trees.

 I called my brother, and we looked at him. He eventually took a few steps back behind a tree and we went around each side of the tree and the man was gone. We looked around and didn't see or hear anything. My brother and I looked at each other. Then, across from us on the other side of the cemetery was that same man. There was absolutely no possible way that man could've gotten over there. We had our eyes on the tree the whole time. He never ran away from the tree or climbed up it. My brother and I just ran. We picked a direction and ran. While running we start to remember where we are. We start turning towards where we think the house is. We were tripping, getting smacked in the face by branches but our adrenaline kept us going. 

Finally, we emerged from the woods and saw the house. We ran in through the back sliding door. My mom, seeing her 15-year-old and her 24-year-old sons who both love the woods running inside, actually worried her. We didn't tell her the truth immediately yet. We lied and said an animal was stalking us. We didn't want to ruin the visit. On the way home, we finally told her. Her being her, she was enthralled by it and wanted to go back one day. But, that was such an odd feeling, being in some backwoods cemetery. Fucking creepy shit. 

~ Search and Rescue is something I've wanted to do for the longest time. I finally got the chance to do it, and everyone always looks to me as the leader because I usually am the one to find the person or people. Most of it is what you'd think. A hiker gets lost and doesn't come home. We get a call from parents or a spouse and we get sent in. We find the person, make sure they are ok at the hospital and then they get sent home. But sometimes, things aren't that easy. I've had my fair share of scary things happen in the woods. I remember one of the first scary things that happened to me. We got a call that a group had gone hiking, but one of their friends walked off to take a piss, but he never came back. So we arrive in the area and start to look for any signs. We searched all day until the sun went down, but we didn't find anything. We brought the dogs out and they had a scent but they lost it. So after the sunset, we started to move back to where the dogs first picked up a scent. We start to move further back to base camp when we start to hear noises. It sounded like someone running, but at an impossibly fast pace. 

We shine our lights in the direction but we couldn't see anything. I heard a branch snap behind me and when I spun around I saw something standing against the tree. I almost didn't see it at first, but then my eyes adjusted and I saw it. It was staring at me. It had one hand on a tree, and it was just looking at me. It stepped behind the tree and as I moved closer all of the sudden, the thing I was seeing climbed up the tree. It was a tall creature. It was about 7 feet tall, very quick, and covered in light gray fur. We immediately ran back to base camp and once we were around other people we felt safer. We were up in New Hampshire. If you go far enough north in New Hampshire, like right up by the Canadian border which is where we were, you'll find some weird things. Anyone who knows about that area will know that up there by the Canadian border you may find what they call "Wood Devils." A Wood Devil is exactly what we saw. A tall skinny fast two-legged creature with light gray fur. I firmly believe that this is what we saw that night. 

~ On the same page as the Wood Devil, I had an encounter with another strange creature. I was out training some rookies. They would have me train occasionally if the other trainers were busy, we had a period of time where Tons of people were being hired as both rangers and S&R officers. We were out pretty far and I was describing to them different callouts we used over the radio when I got an actual call. It was a man who had gone out hiking with a friend but hadn't returned. From the information they got, he was heading in the direction of where I was. So, I told the trainees that we had a real call. We all started looking, using what I had been showing them. I called in for another team to meet us out there, as we had a better chance of finding them with a few experienced officers with me. Once the sun fell, we knew it was going to be significantly harder to find any signs. So we gave ourselves one hour before we would head out. We ended up on a trail that was passing right by a waterfall. I called out for everyone to stay close, but to search this surrounding area. I pulled one of my friends aside, who arrived when I called in for a team. He came with me and we went off the trail up a little hill. We could still see down at the rest of the guys, but this was off the trail. I assumed if they got lost they most likely weren't on a trail when it happened.

 We were surrounded by dense forest. There were so many trees it was hard to see very far in front of you. We wandered off a bit until we heard rustling coming from above. It sounded like someone took hold of a branch and started to shake it. Then it switched to someone landing and footsteps like someone was running. Then the rustling branches again. 

We were looking around but couldn't see anything. Finally, I saw the branches moving but still couldn't see what it actually was. I stepped back to try and get a better look. I backed up so far, and when I went to turn around to see if any trees were in my way, I thought I saw something. I turned back around and saw something on the tree. It howled in my face and jumped off the tree. It was about waist-high, had sharp teeth, and had dog-like faces. We still heard the branches moving, so we knew there was more. My friend and I backed up slowly not wanting this thing to attack us. It howled again and turned to run up the tree. We got out of there and ran back to the group. We started to head back to camp, but we wanted to get as far away as possible from that area where we saw those things. On our way back, I saw a backpack on the ground. I looked to see which direction the tracks went and I had the group follow. We found the two men, camped in between four trees with their tents as walls. We called out to them and asked their names. The names matched the two men who went missing. 

We told them who we were and brought them back to camp. It was only when we arrived back at camp that I noticed how dirty the men were. I asked what happened and they said something chased them and they fell down a hill scratching themselves on trees. That explained why they were dirty and hurt. I described what I saw and they said that my description matched what chased them. Those creatures I saw, and the one that chased those two men, I believe were what's called "Devil Monkeys." They are another well-known New Hampshire, wilderness creature. I'm not sure why they didn't actually attack either myself, my friend, or those two men. But I'm glad it didn't, and I'm glad we got out of there alive that night. 

~ My oldest brother wanted to go exploring one time. So when I was visiting him, we drove up into the mountains and went to explore. There was no trail in these woods, or at least not in the part we were at. It was just the two of us. While walking through we saw a huge dark spot just up ahead. We got closer and realized it was an entrance to an old mine. It was already dark out, so flashlights were our only source of light. We looked at each other and smiled. We walked into the mine. We walked along the rails that the carts once rode on. We walked and walked until we started to hear loud sounds. Like something was being swung with force against something. It took a few minutes to realize that it sounded like a pickaxe hitting rocks. My brother and I looked at each other. "Why would there be someone here?" I asked. My brother just stayed silent and signaled me to follow. The rail came into a big opening. We looked down into the big opening, and there was a light on. We saw someone walking down a path out of our vision. We jumped down and ran over to the man, but when we turned down the path he turned, we didn't see him. 

In fact, the path stopped after about 2 feet in because it was a dead end. It looked like they hadn't mined all the way through. There was no way this man could've snuck by us. We kept our eyes on that path the whole time we walked over there. We heard talking, it sounded like a bunch of people talking, but it was very echoed. It was so bizarre and echoey that if my brother wasn't there, I would've told myself I was hearing things. But no, he looked at me at the same time the voices started, he heard it too. The voices abruptly stopped. We heard a grinding sound. When we turned around, we saw a cart riding slowly along the rail from behind us. It came from another path and stopped. Then we heard something fall. The light that was on had just gone out. We decided it was time to go. We climbed back up onto the rail we came from, and walked back towards the entrance. Once we were almost there, we heard the pickaxe sound again. My brother and I didn't go back in, we just ran. We still explored the woods that night, but not without constantly looking over our shoulders and avoiding that mine. 

~ My friends and I were always adventurous. We grew up in a city so there weren't many areas with woods to explore. A couple of little patches here and there, but nothing crazy. One day after school we went into this little stretch of woods. It was just supposed to be a quick little shortcut for us to get to the train tracks. It was Autumn by the way, and it was getting towards 5:00, the sun was almost all the way down. There was a little stone building. It was clearly abandoned. There were tree branches on top of it, and graffiti all over it. We thought it would be fun to look at. So we go inside, and the place is a complete mess. The graffiti spilled inside, and the place was a ruin. There were these old control panels on the walls, or at least that's what I think they were, leading me to believe that this was once a building to control the train tracks, as it wasn't very far away from them. There wasn't much to the place. The floor inside had collapsed, and it revealed a basement. Well, I'm not sure I'd call it a "basement." It was more than likely just a storage place. 

There were 4 of us that day, and 3 of us decided to jump down while 1 stayed up top. We really didn't know why we wanted to jump down other than sheer curiosity. Classic 13 or 14-year-old thoughts, you know. We looked around the whole place and didn't see anything exciting. As my friend up top was helping us out, I heard a noise come from my left. I looked over and saw something that wasn't there before. I shined my light over and saw a person standing in the corner. There was absolutely no possible way someone was in there. The room was very small and we looked around the whole room more than once. My friends looked over too and I yelled for them to quickly go up. My friend pulled one of my friends up, it was me and my best friend that was left. 

As they grabbed my best friend's hands to pull him up, I looked over to see he was closer. Then I watched him get even closer, but the thing that scared me was, that he wasn't walking toward me. I can't even describe it. It was like when a video game character lags and starts appearing in different places. That's what it looked like. The closer he got, the colder I felt. Finally, all my friends called up to me, and I reached up and they grabbed my hands and started to pull me up. I felt something grab my leg, but only for a second as soon the grip was released and I was up with my friends attempting to catch my breath. I looked back down into the hole... nothing. No one was down there, even my friends looked over with me, no one. We turned around and left. We changed our plans from going through the woods to get to the train tracks, to going to Wendy's. The sight of that "man" or whatever you want to call him, was truly terrifying. The fact that I never saw any bodily or facial features, his stance was the same the whole time, and the fact that I never saw him move his legs when he got closer to me. I never went back to that building. 

~This story is the only story I refused to tell anyone for a few years because of how disturbing it is, I did not want to relive it. This is absolutely the scariest thing that has ever happened to me in my entire life. We got a call that a woman and her daughter had gone missing. The husband had called after they didn't return that night. So we went out there at about 4:00 in the afternoon so we still had a few hours of daylight. Come 6:00 and we haven't found anything. I'm frustrated because now, not to toot my own horn here but I'm very good at tracking. In fact, none of the trainers will even teach tracking to the rookies, I always do it. So the fact that within two hours, I haven't even found the slightest sign was intensely aggravating. I called my older brother who happened to be with our other brother. I asked if they wanted to be volunteers for a night. They agreed and I told them to meet me at the opening to the trail. They weren't far as my brother lives only 40ish minutes away and with his driving, make it 30.

 My brothers arrived and I briefed them. I wasn't even fully finished with my sentence, but after I mentioned "mother and daughter missing" my brother turned his truck off and got out. My other brother got out as well. My oldest brother, who as I've mentioned in these stories also loves the woods and prides himself on being able to find people. He always wanted to be an S&R officer like myself; he just never had any experience, and this was his chance. My other brother was just tagging along as an extra set of eyes. I radioed in saying that I was taking my brothers as volunteers on our own. I remember it like it was yesterday. We were walking through, and I was describing techniques we use to find people. It was chilly that night and there was some rain that had started to come down too. We were rounding a corner when I stopped them. We were on a path, but it wasn't necessarily an actual walking path. It's hard to describe, but it looked like it was a homemade path. I saw something that looked unnatural off to the right. It was a bunch of dirt and branches piled up against a rock, but it looked like someone had put it there, nature didn't make that. We go over and start to push all of it out of the way, once we cleared it all and pushed the rock out of the way, we saw it. There was a metal sheet on the ground. We kicked it out of the way. It was covering a hole in the ground. It was a decent-sized hole, enough for a human to fit. My oldest brother and I were shining flashlights into it to see if we could see anything. My other brother calls us over to come to look at something. The "trail" we were on rounded along a lake, and he was standing by the water. We walked over and looked down into the water. 

Directly across the path from the hole, but in the water, if that makes any sense was a small ladder and at the bottom of the ladder was a wooden trapdoor-looking thing with a padlock on it in the water. They were both under the water. My brother kept checking that out, while my other brother and I went back over to the hole. For some reason, we thought we would be able to jump and use our weight to break the dirt around the hole. All three of us took turns jumping as hard as we could on the dirt around the hole but it was no use. My brother who found the ladder in the water jumped in. The water wasn't deep or anything. He tried to mess with the padlock. He couldn't get it to open. I decided that we needed to see what was down there. You hate thinking about the worst-case scenario, but with two people missing in these woods, I couldn't help but think maybe they were in there. 

Since we didn't know how deep the hole was, I had my brother hold my ankles while I crawled in. The hole went in at an angle, but then it smoothed out. It was big enough for them to come in too. So I called out that they could let me go, and for them to come in, and they did. There were two paths. I sent them to go down the left, and I would go down the right. As I was crawling, I started to hear crying. It was most definitely a female crying, but it was still in the distance. I kept moving with my flashlight as my only light source. The crying stopped and everything was silent. Until I heard someone yell. It was a woman yelling "Help!" It sounded very echoey. I started crawling faster. At one point there was a turn. When I made the turn, I saw light maybe 20 feet away. I turned my light off and started crawling towards the light. Once I got closer I slowed down and peeked in. There was a lantern hanging from the ceiling. It was like a lantern you would see in western times. But that was the nicest thing in this room. I was able to stand up after crawling in. It was a small room, so if someone was in there I would've been able to see them. But, in this room, there were blood stains on the floor. There was a makeshift table in this room. It was made with a couple of planks of wood. 

On this table was a bone saw, along with some other items like a few knives, and a chain hanging from the room. On the saw was dried up blood, along with blood stains on the wood. I wanted to quit my job at this point. I wanted to just turn around and go home and never come back. I heard noises coming from behind me, but when I turned around I saw it was my brothers. They emerged from the hole saying they heard a woman scream for help. I told them it came from this room. So we looked around, but as I said, it wasn't a huge room. If someone was in there, we would've found them. We started to hear the crying again. It was kind of faint, but it had to have been coming from this room. I called out, asking if anyone was in there, no response. But the crying continued. The chain in the middle of the room started to swing, making a metallic sound as it hit each wall.

 Confused and freaked out, we started crawling back out. I was in the back. Once we were about maybe 10 or 15 feet from the hole I heard a woman's voice say, "Please, don't go!" It wasn't in a panicky voice either. Just very echoey. I turned and looked back at the room. There's no way anyone could've been in there, I even called out when we were there, and someone would've responded. I looked back and saw my brothers were looking back too. I told them to just go. As we made the turn going back, we started to hear the crying I heard earlier. We heard a noise, it was a drilling sound. Maybe the sound of a dental drill? I'm not sure, but it was a drilling sound followed by a man's scream. It sounded just like the woman's voice. Very echoey. Like they were in a cave. 

The sense of fear I felt down there was indescribable. It felt like someone laid 200 pounds on my chest. My throat was also locking up. You know that feeling you get in your throat when you try to cry quietly? That's what I was feeling. I had the most overwhelming sense of fear and paranoia I've ever felt in my life. I told them to go faster. Once we were finally out of there, I felt like I could breathe again. I was taking so many breaths, it felt like I was holding my breath the entire time I was down there. I was lightheaded and almost to the point of tunnel vision. Visibly the sight was enough to give anybody the creeps. I believe in the paranormal, and I believe some bad things happened in that room, and we were hearing from the victims. My brothers told me that the left path led to a little spot where that ladder came in. I called the team and told them to send the police to that spot. We left that night feeling relieved to be out. We found the little girl and her mother a mile away from that underground room along the lake using rocks as cover. But just the way I was consumed with the feeling of fear, paranoia, and death. I never want to experience something like that ever again, even thinking back on that incident gives me goosebumps. Hearing that woman's voice, all echoey. There are some things in the woods that you would only see in a nightmare. 

I have a few more stories, but I don't want to bore everyone with all the reading. I don't want these stories to deter anyone from going out into the woods. All of my pleasant experiences in the woods completely outweigh all of the bad or scary stuff I've experienced. I still go out all the time. By the way, I feel like it's worth mentioning my brother got a job as an S&R officer. I vouched for him. Stay safe out there everybody!

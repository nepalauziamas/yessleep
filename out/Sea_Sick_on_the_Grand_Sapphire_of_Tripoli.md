When you are at sea anything can happen and i'm someone who survived the worst of the worst. You see I worked for a cruise line as an entertainer for about 13 years. I was a magician and worked a few shows a day. It was the best job in the world. Until it wasn't. What I saw can never be truly explained but I'll do my best. 


This is my last attempt to get the story out what happened on the ship that vanished. A ship that now has no record of ever existing now. Over 3000 people gone and to my knowledge, I'm the only one left. I still remember the Grand Sapphire of Tripoli and her final tour. 


We set sail from the east coast of the US and were meant to make it to Bermuda. My shows were going great. Mostly old folks went on these cruises so my magic shows were quite easy to entertain. Everything was going great and I even got a date one night in the captains lounge. Things were going perfectly until the first sickness happened.


On the 4th night of the cruise a waiter had fallen sick while working a meat carving station. It was a rather nasty illness. Something had caused the man to bleed from his eyes, nose and mouth. It was quite the spectacle as blood gushed out all over the roasted meats. Passengers alarmed all fled the dinning hall and the man was taken to the sick bay. 


It wasn't uncommon for crew or passengers to come down with illness while at sea. There was a whole medical staff on board just for these scenarios and with the recent panics over viruses cruise ships had begun to practice even safer restrictions when illness arose. 


This was something else though. Something that went from zero to 100 fast. The next day half the dinning hall who had been exposed to the man we're exhibiting similar symptoms of bleeding. One child had gotten the illness and turned the whole water slide a bloody mess as he rushed into the main pool with a flow of blood behind him.


On the 5th night over 50 people had contracted the illness and everyone was told to remain in their rooms for in room meal delivery while the ship would undergo a deep clean overnight. Not one crew member would survive the deep clean. 


When I woke up the next morning I had awoken to a bit of a hangover. I had decided to rendezvous with the lady I had dinner with the night before. Her husband had been one of the sick and she decided to take advantage of the situation. I being a scumbag had elected to fully support the debauchery. I'm a magician not a priest. 


When I stumbled out of the room I noticed things were different. Even this early, during the day, things were typically active. Not on this somber morning. As I made my way to the elevator the door opened and inside was what looked like an elderly man. His face was missing. Just a limp body on the floor covered in blood. The most nauseating thing was realizing that the man's face had been chewed off. It dawned on me when I saw his leg had a tooth sticking out of it. A human tooth. 


I decided to take the employee stairs and saw more blood stains. It slowly was turning into a horror movie. I made my way to where breakfast was served for crew. I was trying to find someone to tell me what was going on. That's when I saw it. It was about 10 crew members all face down rapidly moving their heads back and forth. I could hear gurgles coming from something. I by accidentally knocked a cup over and they all turned to face me. That's when I saw our captain. At least what was left of our captain. Those 10 crew members had been gnawing on the captain.


I stumbled out of there and took a pole that had been holding a velvet rope.  I jammed it through the doors to keep them at bay. As I made my way down the hall I could hear more gnawing and screams. Feet shuffling around. I knew I had to make it to the decks. I had to find a lifeboat and get off this ship. 


I knew where they kept the lifeboats and had been trained in how to release them. I imagined I wouldn't be the only one with this idea. At this point I knew it was survival. I emerged on the decks and could see I wasn't the only one. The problem was it wasn't anyone healthy there. They noticed me and began to run towards me gnashing their teeth. I grabbed the closest thing to me which was a bottle of champagne and bashed in the head of a man. 


I just kept swinging until I could make sight of the lifeboats. Blood splatters everywhere. I don't know how many I had bashed in but I just kept pushing forward. Hoping I would never become whatever it is they were. 


Finally I made it to the lifeboat. I got in and shut the door and pulled the emergency release. The lifeboat dropped down into the firgid Atlantic ocean. The ship full steam ahead leaving me behind in it's wake. I watched the ship as it sailed over the horizon.


I spent a full day in that boat before I saw any other sign of life. I awoke to the sound of fighter jets flying over head. I watched them as they flew in the direction the boat had headed. Soon I could see a fireball just at the edge of the horizon and a large plume of smoke. 


Three days later I was found by a passing freightliner. They pulled me on board as I told the crew my story. They were all astonished by what I told them and they recognized that the lifeboat indeed was from a cruise ship. They contacted American port authority and I was taken in by the FBI. 


I told them my story and waited for them to come back and tell me about what had happened. Instead of them coming back I was met by a few doctors. They then transferred me to a mental health psych ward. Involuntarily admitted for 6 months. 


I spent the first 3 months trying to tell them what I had experienced was real. A boat full of murderous people eating each other. Each time I told my story, the more I felt crazy. They more I started to believe I had made this all up.


There was no ship. There were no cannibals. I wasn't a ship magician. They told me I had stolen an old cruise ship life boat and made it all up. After the 6th month I had fully believed I was crazy. I started to repeat the story they told me to believe. 


There was no cruise ship. I wasn't a magician. I lied. No one died. 


With the meds and my story in check they released me. Things went okay. I became a normal citizen again. The facility helped me reintegrate back into society. For the past year I was normal. 


Then last week I got a letter. This was the letter I received:


"You weren't the only one to survive. The government lied to you. They destroyed the ship. They covered it all up. Meet me at the coordinates on the back of the photo enclosed. You will be picked up in 3 hours. Be ready to leave. Send out your story to the press before you leave."


I reached in the envelope to find a photo of the ship with a giant gaping hole from a missel. The bow of the ship was sinking. They blew up the ship. 


So this is my message to you. Tell the world. Share this on social media. The US government killed everyone on the Grand Sapphire of Tripoli. Now you know.

[*Who would believe a witch?*](https://reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/xrmzii/the_eden_witch_trials_false_witness_part_four/)

I have selected the most pertinent passages from my great–(x16)–grandmother’s memoirs to illustrate the events of the Eden witch trials, during which she was one of many accused, tried, and convicted of practising witchcraft. My notes are in brackets.

*On the following day, I was informed I had a visitor. I was taken to the matrons’ room, where I met an unshackled Betsy, standing with Mr. Pearson.*

“Betsy?”

*Mr. Pearson said,* “She has done right by God, Goody Noyes.”

*Betsy knelt before me, her hands clasped together, and said,* “Confess, Mother. Save your immortal soul before it is too late.” *I could not move freely due to my shackles, but Betsy grabbed my hands with hers as she stood up, and she continued,* “We have done grievous sins, Mother, and we must repent of them.”

“What do you mean?”

“You must surely know that we are witches, Mother.”

“What?”

“We have signed the Devil’s book. Yet Mr. Pearson will lead us back to God if only we confess.”

*Who told her these lies?*

“Betsy, you are no witch. You know this to be true. Do not bear false witness.”

“’Tisn’t false witness, Mother, ’tis the truth.”

*I could not bear to hear anymore, so I asked to be taken back to my cell.*

“Please, Mother, confess, and save your soul!”

“I shall not lie before God.”

“Mother. . . .” *Betsy’s voice trailed off as I was led back to my cell. Tears welled up in my eyes, and I wept in the darkness of my cell. My child. They broke her spirit. And I could do nothing.*

*Before the third Sabbath of July, I was again taken to Gallows Hill with other accused witches to witness the hangings of five women, including Alse Sheldon. The four other women went to their deaths without a word.*

*As she stepped onto the ladder and the noose was placed around her neck, Goody Sheldon stood upright, and she raised her eyes heavenward, praying,* “Our Father, Who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy Name. Thy Kingdom come, Thy Will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.”

*The crowd was dumbfounded. Some were in tears. Others had their mouths agape. How could a witch recite the Lord’s Prayer? Such a thing was considered impossible.*

*As the crowd murmured among themselves, Mr. Pearson said,* “Goody Sheldon has been lawfully tried and convicted of witchcraft.”

*Ann Pearson added,* “The Devil whispered in her ear what to say!”

*The other girls agreed.*

*Mr. Pearson continued,* “Does not even Scripture say, ‘Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light?’”

*The crowd was swayed.*

*Goody Sheldon was turned off the ladder.*

*In the midst of the following week, I was informed I had a visitor. ’Twas the night before my trial. The visitor was John.*

“How is the child?” *He asked as he gestured toward my belly.*

*I answered,* “It grows as it should.”

*John appeared troubled, so I asked,* “What is it, John?”

*He answered,* “Betsy is still here. The jailers have refused to grant me permission to even see her. I do not know what to do, Mary.”

*Betsy was* still *imprisoned? How could that be? She confessed to witchcraft. She should have been released to her father. They must be using her as another way to intimidate me into confessing myself as a witch.*

*John interrupted my thoughts as he said,* “I will always stand by you and Betsy.” *He held my hand in his, and then the jailers took me back to my cell.*

*When I awoke in the morning, I was taken to the meetinghouse, shackled, to be tried as a witch. As we walked past my house, I saw my garden. The plants were gone. I assumed the coven had taken them. When we reached the meetinghouse, I was led to the stand by the jailers. My accusers testified under oath about my sundry acts of witchcraft. I was waiting for the jury to find me “Guilty,” and the judge to sentence me to death by hanging. I had no hope for an acquittal. However, the judge called one final witness.*

“John Noyes, Sr.”

*I was surprised. I did not know John would testify. He took the witness stand.*

*The judge asked,* “Tell us, Mr. Noyes, what did you confess to us about your wife?

“I confessed she is a witch.”

*I felt my heart sink within me.*

“I admit she is an enemy to all good.”

*How could he do this to me?*

“Goody Noyes, have you nothing to say to your husband?”

*I looked downward.*

“Have you nothing else to say in your own defence?”

*I continued to keep my peace. John was dismissed by the judge. The jury was sent to deliberate their verdict. After an hour and a half, the jury returned.*

*The judge asked,* “How do you find?” 

*The foreman of the jury answered,* “‘Guilty.’”

*The judge sentenced me,* “Goodwife Mary Noyes, you have been found guilty of the crime of witchcraft. You shall be conducted to the place of execution, that is, Gallows Hill, where you shall be hanged by the neck until dead. Yet this Court takes into account your condition, and your execution is stayed until you are delivered of your child.”

*I was taken back to jail, heartbroken by my husband’s betrayal.*

*My broken heart led me to anger. I was furious. I was condemned to death for a crime I did not commit, but the coven in Eden, led by Mr. Bayley and Goody Reed, aided by Sarah and Mercy Whitcomb, among many others, were free to continue their grievous sins against God and man. . . .*

*As I thought of the coven, I remembered their Witches’ Sabbath. There was one thing I still did not understand. Mr. Bayley said,* “The Master asks for a living sacrifice.” *Their Master wanted a sacrifice greater than that of a bound lamb. I recalled the discussion between Mr. Bayley and Goody Reed.* “Goody Noyes shall grow what we need,” *Mr. Bayley said, and Goody Reed interrupted him,* “In the earth and the flesh.”

*I felt the child within me stir.*

*I came to a horrifying realisation.*

*The plants were grown in the earth, and my child was grown in the flesh.*

*The witches had to have arranged my pregnancy, so I would grow what they needed for their Master. My baby would be taken from me after its birth, and it would be sacrificed to the Devil. Its fat would thereafter be used to create their abominable flying ointment.*

*I was horrified. What could I do? I was nearly five months into my pregnancy. There* was *still time to save myself and my unborn child, but time would eventually run out.*

*I had to find a way.*

“By God,” *I said,* “I will find a way.”

*Five women and three men were hanged before the first Sabbath of August. The trials in Eden had now claimed eighteen lives. The authorities continued to force us to witness the hangings to intimidate us into confessing ourselves as witches.*

“What a sad thing to see eight firebrands of Hell hanging there,” *Mr. Pearson said as he looked upon their swaying bodies.*

*After we were returned to jail, I sat in my cell, chained to the wall, and I felt the child within me move. I became lost in thought. The child was likely conceived by witchcraft. Yet I could not help but love her. After all, she was flesh of my flesh, blood of my blood, bone of my bone. No matter who her father was, devil or man, I was her mother. There was nothing that could change that fact.*

*I asked for permission to see Betsy, but I was denied. The jailers told me that she had been released into her father’s custody the previous week. Although I was confused as to why I was not informed of her release, I was relieved that she was no longer in prison for a crime she did not commit.*

*Before the third Sabbath of September, seven more accused witches were hanged. Four women and three men went to their deaths at Gallows Hill. Although we knew it not at the time, these hangings were to be the last of the trials in Eden.*

*’Twas around a week later. I was awakened by screams from outside the jail.* “He is dead! Lord, help us! He is dead!” *It sounded like Goody Reed. During the mayhem, I heard the jailers whisper that Mr. Pearson was found dead. We were bewildered. How and when and where did he die? We were led outside the jail in shackles. Mr. Howe stood silent. Goody Reed wailed. The villagers were confused.*

*What happened?*

*According to Goody Reed, she found Mr. Pearson in the graveyard near Gallows Hill. He had suffered a tremendous blow, and he fell onto a stone, causing him to bleed out from his head. Most of us recalled Goody Oliver’s words before she was hanged.* “By God, Reverend, you shall have my blood upon your head!” *Who knew if the stone was not a crude marker for Goody Oliver’s grave? Her curse came to pass. Ann Pearson, who was now an orphan, was comforted by her friends. Near the end of the following week, Mr. Howe, the deacon of the church, led the prayers as Mr. Pearson was buried in the Christian cemetery alongside his late wife. Ann was going to be taken in by her aunt soon after the funeral.*

*On the day after the funeral, we found that Ann Pearson had fled the Village in the still of the night. She had absconded with her inheritance, the entirety of Mr. Pearson’s money chest, with her friends, Mercy Whitcomb, Mary Hobbs, and Tamsin Dane. Sarah Whitcomb was left behind to deal with the aftermath. Without the support of Mr. Pearson or her friends, Sarah was no longer looked upon as a saint, but as a base and shameful girl. She was a social pariah until she left the Village a week later. No one knew where she went, or, at least, they did not care enough to look for her.*

*The villagers in Eden, who were without a minister, called for my father–in–law, Reverend* [James] *Noyes, as well as Reverend* [William] *Hale, both of whom were ministers in neighbouring Towns. After their arrival in Eden, Mr. Noyes and Mr. Hale were appalled by the state in which they found the Village. They said that neighbour was against neighbour, and “good Christian women and men” were being accused of witchcraft without sufficient evidence. The ministers petitioned the Governor, who immediately dissolved the Court in Eden, and convened a new Court in the Capital to prosecute the accused who remained in jail. Almost all of the accused were found “Not Guilty,” and no one was sentenced to death.*

*My conviction was overturned, along with the convictions of twenty other men and women. We were released from jail in early November. I was imprisoned in late May. I had lost six months of my life. After my husband’s testimony at my trial, I found it difficult to return home to him. I was reunited with my children, Betsy, Patsy, and Johnny, whom I missed above all else. At the insistence of my father–in–law, I agreed to have a discussion with my husband, and we were able to reconcile through his father’s mediation. John revealed that he had to testify against me to secure Betsy’s release from jail. I believed him, and I forgave him. How could I not? He did it for our child.*

*On the first Sabbath of December, I was delivered of my child, whom I named “Faith.” She was a healthy, hearty baby girl. I could see myself in her face. I do not know if I was deceiving myself, but I thought I could also see John. In any case, she was his daughter. He was her father. The witches’ works were in vain. Evil did not win. Good triumphed in the end.*

After describing her life following the witch trials, Mary Noyes’ memoirs came to an end, and her grandson, John Hale, the author, displayed the Noyes family tree on the final page. I believed I was descended from Martha Noyes Hale, who married the son of Rev. William Hale. I followed her line from John until the mid–19th century, when there were no more additions to her line of the family tree. I was confused. Comparing my own family tree to the one displayed at the end of the book, I discovered I was not a descendant of Martha. I was a descendant of Faith, whose line continued into the early 20th century, which concluded with the addition of my newly born great–grandmother.

*Faith?*

As I looked at the family tree, I remembered reading about Faith’s conception. In horror, I recalled the details of Mary Noyes’ apparent dream after she lay with her husband. *The Devil, conjured from Hell by witches, deposited his seed inside me.* It could not be. Would I not know if I was a hellspawn? My mind was soon flooded with memories that seemed to now make sense. I could never stand being in a church. I had a scar on my forehead that appeared soon after I was baptised. I became physically ill at my First Holy Communion. I fainted after my Confirmation. Animals seemed to be scared of me, so I was not allowed to have a pet as a child. Perhaps most important of all was my great–grandmother on her deathbed. Holding my hand in hers, she said, solemnly, “Always know who you are.” I thought she meant it as a reminder to be my most authentic self. What if she meant that not as a reminder, but as a warning to know who, or what, I am?

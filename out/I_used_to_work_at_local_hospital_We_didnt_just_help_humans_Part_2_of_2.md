Hey there, for all of you out there who are reading this, it’s me Frank again. It’s been a while since I last wrote. I have been busy for the past few days but now that I’m finally free, I thought the least I could do is to inform all of you of what had happened over these days. So I will jump right into where I left off last time.I had taken a lot of time planning and preparing for this trip. I wasn’t sure what could be down in the basement. For all I know, it could have been a dusty old place filled with old equipment and furniture. But, my curiosity got the better part of me and that’s why I still decided to risk it.

Hey there, for all of you out there who are reading this, it’s me Frank again. It’s been a while since I last wrote. I have been busy for the past few days but now that I’m finally free, I thought the least I could do is to inform all of you of what had happened over these days. So I will jump right into where I left off last time. I had taken a lot of time planning and preparing for this trip. I wasn’t sure what could be down in the basement. For all I know, it could have been a dusty old place filled with old equipment and furniture. But, my curiosity got the better part of me and that’s why I still decided to risk it.

I had come armed with my phone, a Swiss army knife, and a powerful industrial flashlight. Everything had gone according to plan. The staff from the previous shift have long departed before I arrived. It would still be 20 or 30 minutes before the next shift begins so I will probably have enough time to snoop around for a bit. But just in case, I checked disabled the security cameras at the front desk before entering the basement. Its door was made out of a strong industrial steel cheaply painted light green to match the other door in the hospital. It had no window and its hinges were starting to rust. Thankfully, I had Rick's keycard so with a quick swipe I unlocked the door, I knew then the moment I stepped across the threshold there's no going back.

I turned on my flashlight to reveal a dark and musty hallway. It seemed to go on endlessly downwards, and I kept following it for a while. I will be honest with you, I was terrified. I think it has something to do with some primitive part of the human brain. The Cave men weren't terrified of a Saber Tooth tiger or a rampaging Mammoth, but instead, we’re afraid of dying alone and dying unheard. This sounds odd right? But humans are naturally social animals, we scream to warn others of danger to save the others so to say. I had that feeling every moment that I was walking down that hallway. I felt as though I could be swallowed by the darkness and I will just be gone, never heard from again.

For several long minutes, I kept walking, until finally, I reached another set of steel doors, this one unpainted and looking more crudely made than the one before. Its corners were a brownish crimson from rust crawling up the edges. I checked the door and was surprised that it wasn’t locked. It swung open with a slight push. Light poured out from the room behind it temporarily blinding me. As my vision slowly came back to focus, I could see inside was filled with strange machines that I had never seen and there were several manually locked cabinets seemingly to house some obscure documents. I decided to break open one of the locks with my flashlight before opening the cabinet and inspecting the contents. Inside were files dated as far back as August 5th. The document contains details about a mission to extract some form of alien life form from the moon. Allegedly, it was to be engineered and used as a biological countermeasure against nuclear arsenal.“What the fuck. . ..” Another document caught my eye, it read, Experiment status: *FAILURE* I immediately picked it up and started to read its contents. “*The weapon has failed to achieve the previous expected results and the “test subjects” did not show any particular effects from the weapon”* I let out a sigh of relief knowing that “the weapon” has probably been either destroyed or is currently kept away in a safe location. But things weren’t adding up, if the project was cut, then these documents shouldn’t be here, they would have long been shredded or stored in some government facility not a public hospital, then why are they here? Unless. . . Suddenly something behind me stirred and it sent me tumbling backwards. I immediately shined my flashlight on the spot I had been leaning against mere seconds ago. It revealed a glass tank filled with a strange greenish liquid, inside was the woman I had seen several days ago, except she looked drastically different. Her stomach had swelled unnaturally and her eyes were filled with animalistic fear. She kicked at the tank with her bare feet, She seemed to be saying something muffled by the liquid. I was shocked and horrified,

“ what the fuck happened here?” I thought as I shined my flashing in a semi circle to reveal more and more tanks filled with people in similar states to the woman, they were either unconscious or attempting to communicate with me. I was shocked and confused, how is the hospital doing this to people, why hasn't anyone noticed that this was happening?

“Frank, is that you?” I heard in a familiar voice behind me, I knew immediately it was my superior, Rick.“What kind of bullshit is going on here?” I demanded trying to get to the point.“Look Frank, you shouldn’t have seen this, we could all walk away if . . .”“Know, we can't. I need to know what motherfuckers like you are doing down here!” I cried out like a rabid animal.

“Frank, believe when I say this it’s for their good, we’re helping them!” Rick desperately tried to explain.“Help them? Then explain what the papers are in the cabinets!” I sneered

“Wait you .. .” Rick tried to say“Yes, I read them and I know you’re definitely fucking around with something down here!” I yelled accusatively.Rick, sighed in frustration and said “You know how much of my life is dedicated to everything around you?”“You don’t understand none of those stupid higher ups understand what greatness we have achieved! We have successfully revived a race of long extinct aliens! If only anyone would listen!” Rick yelled frustrated at my stupidity and ignorance to his “great achievements”.“And at what cost? The lives of hundreds if not thousands of innocent lives?! What the fuck is wrong with people like You?” I lashed out like a rapid animal frantically pointing around me at all the tanks filled with the disgusting fluid and bodies.

“Oh you wouldn’t understand, this is for a greater good, I’ve done them a favour, they don’t know yet, they are part of a history changing event!” Rick, tried to reason with me.

“Screw your fucking project!” I tried to barge past Rick to leave this madness behind and leave it to the authorities to deal with mad men like Rick or whoever he really is.

“Frank. . Come back now, don’t make me . . c’mon you fucking deaf or something?” I heard a click and I knew what was behind me. Rick had probably pulled a gun on me, I was shocked, I froze in my spot and didn’t dare look back.“C’mon Frank we don’t have time for funny business, get on your knees I will tie you up.. . Try not to struggle or it's in your head.” I knew Rick probably had the guts to put a bullet in my head if he can sleep while using innocent people as lab rats.I knelt down with my hand on the back of my head, Rick talked into his walkie talkie about some “code blue” and how he needed some “reinforcements” I knew I was screwed, and he was probably going to do some kind of crap to fuck me up too or worst, he will make keep me down here with the others to protect his secret.

Rick tied me up with some ropes and secured me to a chair. He swore about how the “others” were being careless leaving everything for him to do. He then proceeded to turn his back in a cabinet taking out a jug of some mystery liquid which he started brewing like some kind of 80s kid’s chemistry kit. He then told me to drink up. The liquid resembled the ones in the tanks behind me. I knew this was my only chance to escape since one of his hands was holding the cup in front of me and his gun was on the table. I thrashed but I knew it was a while before the rope would loosen up, and the cup was getting ever closer to my mouth, I clamped down my teeth refusing to drink this liquid. As it approached my nose, I could smell it, it smelled of rotten eggs mixed with human spit.

“Drink up bitch I don’t want to do the choo choo train on you!” Rick warned, but I still refused to open my mouth, which he then proceeded to take as a green light for option 2. He punched my jaw sore, then proceeded to dump half the cup into my mouth before I fell over. The liquid burned my tongue and I choked on it. Its effects were immediate, I felt feverish, but my instinct to survive overrode everything. I somehow struggled free and pushed Rick into the counter behind him, he ended up banging his head against it and getting knocked on conscious. I half limped and half ran my way out of that wretched dark tunnel, when I opened the door, I noticed the hospital was shut down, probably Rick’s idea to cover up the fuckery downstairs.

The last things I remember after dragging myself to my old Wagon, was driving an hour and a half trip to a local motel, and that was 3 days ago, I haven’t been feeling to well lately and I’ve felt quite bloated and an increased appetite, I try not to think about it sometimes, but I know, it has something to do with what I drank that fateful night . . .

This is a tale of a young boy we interviewed after finding him in an abandoned school...

"A stranger gave me this weird book this
morning I might as well read it". The moon
is full and there is a storm brewing outside, the wind makes the windows rattle. Jack is alone at home. His dad was on a school trip with his sister and his mother had passed away earlier that year. "This book is too close to home". Thunder strikes and a moan echoes through every corner of the house. "Huh, that was probably just the wind." Something drips from the ceiling... "What just landed on my nose !" ...Jack hears a noise from his closet... "This is no longer fun!"...before he could investigate he is attacked by a familiar ghost. 'Nope sorry I'll read on when its sunny".

The closet slowly opens with unoiled hinges. Jack looks at it breathing deeply hoping that the beating in his ears is just his heart. All of a sudden everything was calm. No storm. No heart beat... Then, slamming the closet doors open, a spectre rushes straight at Jack. Grabs him by the ears and lets off a glass shattering, room shaking screech. As the ghost vanishes into the roof, Jack recognised the ghost from its figure. Mother? He could bearly exclaim.

No light except for that from the occasional lightning strike. Jack finds a flash light thats more flash than light. "Leaving the room was probably the best plan of action to find what is keeping Mother here". As Michael stepped out of his room he was greated by the smell of his mother's baking her house famous Creamy chicken pizza but when he got into the kitchen...a flash back from that day...was disrupted by the spine chilling sight of the memory turning to decay as the smell of rot insults the very air.

Jack felt drawn towards the cast iron pot that was used with the creation of every meal, however as soon as he laid hands on it mother came out of the pantry with a knife sharp enough to cleave through bone with ease, her eye's are bubbling with rage, he has only seen once when he was caught smoking. She let out a cry and chased him to the indoor bbq.

He considered the room toxic as the aroma of fresh cut cannabis laid thicker than honey. A sharp and sudden pain pierced his lunges. He had no choice but to cough...unwillingly becoming a mother...his children triggered his arachnophobia more than real spiders did. What's worse is that they multiplied like
rabbits and soon started dripping from the ceiling. In closing his eyes he hoped that he would stumble upon something important before he died of fear.

As luck would have it he found his mother's lighter, a horrible screech arose from the thousands of tiny legs as they combined in the furthest corner. Taking the shape of his Mother's decayed body. Running on all fours upon the ceiling darting towards Jack like someone who is possessed. Chasing him towards her room. What fresh hell awaited him here...

Mother's hair brush stood out like a swore thumb amongst the demonic tools and devices one can only see use for in torture rooms. The only scary thing about the room was imaging what these where used for. He grabbed the brush and before he could blink he found himself infront of a furnace.

It became clear why Mother was pissed. She wished to be turned to ash and not to be buried. Realising this he threw all his Mother's most memorable items in the furnace, at the same moment a blood curdling scream resonated with his very soul...

Jack woke up. "It was all a dream" he exhaled. He turned his head to his bedside table...with a fright he fell out of bed when he saw the book.."It was only a dream from reading the book it couldn't have been real." He thought but as he looked to his table there lay his Mother's ashes in a vase and on it was engraved "THANK YOU"

His body became cold and pale and the air as thin as 1 ply toilet paper. If only he knew the worst was yet to come. His father texted him at midnight... His sister is missing...The school trip was at a haunted forest...

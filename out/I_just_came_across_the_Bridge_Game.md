  

I trust you all have heard of the 11-mile game. You’ve also no-doubt heard of the left-right game. Anyone out there above the age of 3 has heard of the hokey pokey. You put your left foot in, you put your left foot out. Is that what it’s all about? IS IT?

Sorry, I am wired right now. I’ve been up for well over 24 hours now. I lost count at how many toxic energy drinks I’ve had after the fourth one. I started playing a game that at the best outcome has a survivable, but painful, ending. At the worst, I will meet an untimely death. I’m writing this now to try to prevent others from engaging in this little-known ritual. It has been fun though. So, maybe you’ll ignore my warnings. I’m not the boss of you. Do what you think is right. I’d feel better if I at least did my best to prevent further pain and loss.

We have all been there. Bored, lonely, searching scary paranormal and/or true-life scary stories in your local area. This is how I came across “the troll bridge.” As I was falling deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole, the one that Alice fell into, I found that my own state had one of those generic bridges that people experience insane paranormal happenings. What was the name of the rabbit that created that famous “rabbit hole,” anyway? The I-don’t-have-time rabbit? I don’t think that’s what Lewis Carroll officially named him, but he was always pointing at his watch, right?

As fate would have it, I had just taken a job that required me to travel throughout my state. I would drive hundreds of miles every day, sometimes having to stay overnight. I delivered “sensitive,” packages. It was a don’t ask, need to know, type of job. I didn’t ask and didn’t need to know. I knew the money was always paid and always on time.

One of my most travelled routes took me to the town where this infamous “troll bridge,” resided. I never knew of this legend, and I’m up on paranormal, strange stories. Especially in my own corner of the world. After a very quick google search, I found that this place was just miles away from where I regularly dropped off those sensitive packages. I’m going to stay an extra day in the town of, believe it or not, “Bridge,” Ohio.

Well, don’t believe it. There’s no town called Bridge. And I’m not near Ohio. Just making up a place so you won’t find it. I won’t tell anyone exactly where it is. This game turned out to be real. Too real to get anyone else tangled into this heart-pounding ritual.

I also don’t want to explain the history of this game. It’s just a generic story that every town has. The game is more interesting than the “true life,” story it is supposedly based on. I will, however, repeat the last line of the post that sent me on this path.

After searching the story of this place, I came across a post on reddit that genuinely freaked me out. It explained the history of the bridge, what happened there, and the game that followed. The last line read: “All you have to do is clear your heart and mind when approaching the bridge. Cross on foot. Observe.”

Pretty cryptic, right. It has all the makings of a good creepypasta. A good story. And just that, a story. What really caught my eye though, was a reply buried deep in the thread. A random user said there’s a game the locals used to play revolving around the bridge.

I’ll paraphrase. 

To start, as the legend goes, clear your heart and mind when you see the bridge. Cross on foot. Do NOT drive. This includes a car, truck, bicycle, unicycle, remote controlled vehicle, etc. As you are crossing the bridge, observe your surroundings. Especially when you break the threshold to the other side. Whatever you are thinking or feeling, that is what you will see first. It could be anything, so you have to pay attention.

You have to get someone else to play the game. If you don’t.. things could get bad. Whatever the bridge gives you, you have to keep. Forever. I know this all seems vague. You just have to experience it for yourself. That’s all I can say. I’m sorry I can’t explain further.

I tried to message the reddit user. Account removed.

This just turned into a fun internet game to maybe something with a more sinister edge to it. I’m beyond the point of no return now. I’m missing something. Something big. Excitement, adventure, life. I’m delivering to the area of Troll bridge next week. I’m going to introduce myself.

After I made my deliveries, I texted my boss, who I’ve never met, and told them I’d be staying over for a night. I made up some bullshit about having to get my car looked at. Not that I had to, I don’t think they cared either way. I checked into a moderately nice hotel just two miles away from the bridge. Driving through this area regularly, I’ve never seen it from the ground level. It was nice. I was relaxed. I grabbed a cheap pint of Canadian Velvet from the liquor store around the corner, I ordered a couple tacos from the “loco gringo,” restaurant inside the hotel, and treated myself to the finest vending machine snacks from the lobby for dessert. All in all, this has already been a huge success. The whiskey made me feel warm, nice. It made me forget why I was there.

Morning come; my whiskey-less brain reminded me why I was indeed here. I spied the empty pint of black velvet sitting on the edge of the bed. Ugh. I should be clearer headed for this mission, but what is done is done.

I set my navigation for the bridge. Luckily there is a lot just a mile away where I can park and walk towards the bridge. From what I can tell there used to be a gas station there. Pulling up to the wide-open space, I have a feeling of dread. Deciding it’s best to push that down, I secure the cargo in the back. One more slug of water and I’m on my way towards the bridge. I double check my phone to see that I’m now only less than a quarter mile from the bridge. Don’t know how the bridge somehow got closer.

“DON’T FORGET.”

I nearly fell on my fat ass. Who said that?! I yelled out loud. Just a reaction, and a silly one at that. There’s no one else out here. I swear that came from out here in the world, not inside my head. After looking around, I confirmed that no one, or thing, could have said that.

I walked.. and walked… and walked. This bridge should have been here a few minutes ago. Is the GPS wrong? Not a surprise, as small areas are well-known for having unreliable GPS directions. Don’t forget. I keep thinking of that mental intrusion. One of the rules of the game is to be clear. The other that I don’t understand right now is whatever you get, you must keep. Forever. I’m not going to think too much into that. 

I didn’t set a timer, but I would guess I walked for over an hour. I eventually put my phone back into my pocket. The GPS wasn’t helping, and I wanted to save my battery. I didn’t think to bring portable chargers. As I turned a corner through a nice suburban neighborhood, I saw it. The bridge. Just out of view, but prominent. The houses were kept up, the lawns were immaculate. Families were enjoying dinner. Families were enjoying dinner. Families were enjoying din- wait? Every house is the same. I can see into a giant bay window of every house. Every kitchen has a huge chandelier providing immense light towards the dining room table. Every meal is the same. Every house has a wonderful mother, father, and two children, boy and girl, enjoying a turkey dinner with mashed potatoes French fries. Seems like a doubling up on starch, not judging, just an odd choice of sides.

That wasn’t as odd as what happened next, I can assure you of that. I saw the bridge now. It’s no golden gate. It’s a bridge in the most literal sense. Barely an extension of a road going above a river, no more than 20 feet wide. The bridge sits approximately eight or so feet above the slow-moving water. As soon as I saw it, I was instantaneously struck by the family inside the last house before the bridge. They all whipped their heads towards me. They had human faces.. but they didn’t. Can any of you remember the masks the intruders wore in the first “Purge,” movie? That’s what the mom, dad, and children looked like. Impossibly long and fake smiles. Plastic, well-kept hair. Let me be clear, they were NOT wearing masks. These were their faces. From nearly 20 feet away I could see that. I walked as fast as I could toward the bridge. I felt like running would trigger this family into breaking through the bay window and coming after me.

Thankfully I did not hear any glass breaking behind me. An off-putting sense of calm came over me. I shouldn’t have felt this calm. I was standing on the threshold of the bridge. In my former profession, when you stop feeling nervous or afraid when going into battle, that’s an issue.

I confidently turned to face my fake-faced-family. With my feet firmly planted on the precipice of the bridge, I torqued my torso and head to see what I could from the last house on the left. They were still there, now standing. I met eyes with all of them. Dead, plastic eyes. Their blank stares gave me nothing. Only the smallest sense of admiration for taking the plunge across the bridge. I gave one last stare and an ever so slight nod. No response.

I calmly walked across the bridge. It felt like the temperature had warmed to a comfortable 68 degrees. It was nice. Pleasant, even. Little fatty cherubs could have been floating me across the bridge. Before I knew it, there I was, firmly planted on the other side. My initial thought: I’ve loved and lost. I’ve hurt and fought.

Looking at an. . . unremarkable subdivision. So, I left one suburb, crossed an angelic bridge, just to reach another suburb? I kept walking. Despite the weirdness, I continued on. Hey, guess this was just a big troll after all. I can’t explain the Manson family I encountered, or the gliding across the bridge, but now I am walking in a subdivision that you’d see any any – whoa.

23224 Rose Bush Lane. Sublime. The most Sublime sight I’ve witnessed in my entire life.

There was no other home like this one. So warm, so inviting. Who owns this place? *No one..* a voice said inside my head. *“Don’t you want to live like this?”*

I deserve a place like this. Three or four bedrooms, from what I can guess from looking at the outside. A gated backyard. I can see into it though. A beautiful kidney shaped pool. Everything so clean. So pristine. I want to live here; I want to show my friends and family this place. I want them to know I did it. 

As if someone snapped their fingers, or hit a clapperboard designating a new scene, it was black outside. The streetlights were on. Ominous artificial light focused on me and the home. I lost time; I just don’t know how much. I didn’t think to check my watch or look at my phone. The feeling of fiery rage was consuming me. I want this life. The feeling of rage was being quickly replaced by a noticeable force. I was moving.. backward.. not by choice. I reached my arms toward the house. “No.. NOO!” “Don’t take me from this place!” I pleaded. I pleaded to whatever or whomever the gamemaster was. I was being pushed backward. I was brought back into the homes. The family that watched me cross the bridge were all slumped over, face down on the dinner table. Turkey and mashed potatoes sloshed everywhere.

My last thought I remember before losing consciousness was “I don’t want to live if I leave here.”

Five AM. Two weeks later.

I attempt to read what I’ve put into this word document. It looks like the writings of a mad man. I only can make sense out of some of it. I’ve loved and lost. I’ve hurt and fought. The home that was supposed to be mine is still on the other side of the bridge. I’ll be back there soon. The game has given me something that I’ll never give up, that’s for sure. My envy to live. I’ll take that house any way I can. I won’t follow the second rule though. I won’t put anyone through this burning pain. I don’t know what the consequences will be. I guess I’ll find out soon enough.

Two jerry cans filled with gasoline will take care of my abysmal dwelling for now. Once I’m done with these last few sentences, I’ll e-mail this to a friend of mine. I have strict instructions on where to post this to warn others. Do not take part on this game. I don’t know what the game will give you. It’s given me a desire to live a different life. A life I never knew I wanted. A life I never knew I needed.

I have indeed lived and loved. I will lose and fight. See you on the other side, Troll Bridge.

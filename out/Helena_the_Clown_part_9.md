The road up to the Ialomița village was quite. The village was quiet in itself. Just endless fields around, as you see, more or less, in southern Romania. A few people on the streets, but not too many. Perhaps the people were working. This road outside of Bucharest was, clearly, good for me already.

&#x200B;

I remembered father George Baka from that case of the possed little boy from that village, close to the Râmnicu Vâlcea City. He was called to deal with the issue, not being the first time. Father George already had a reputation of a ”warrior” in demonic possession, or haunted locations. He said several times that all priests can do what he does, having the same grace received at ordination. Yet, his fame grew, it is not sure why. He has got involved in several cases, people got to know him, and the story arose. I, for myself believe that, although he said any priest could do what he does, that he has a lot of experience and this mattered. That little boy was tormented pretty well back then, I was suppose to say on camera that no real signs of possession were present, but the case was too clear. So, I remember I have made a compromise: I toned down the gravity of the possession on camera, but did not denied it. Tried to show an ”open mind”, but my boss scolded me for not obeying the orders to lie. I was about to lose my job then. But I did not. I admit I was a little scared back then, talked to father George a little after it. I remembered I have asked him about his last name, he told me it is Albanian in origin, that he descents from an Albanian soldier who converted from Islam to Orthodox Christianity and fled to Romania, to be safe from persecution. He told me that the little boy was affected by a family curse, that someone from that family seems to have brought some curse on the family. He also said that the boy is a martyr of his own, that the best solution would be for the family to accept the curse and its causes, to make things right, in order for the child to be free. What I so that day made a believer in the supernatural, I admit.

&#x200B;

When we stopped at the church gate, I was hopeful. Not incredibly hopeful, but hopeful. We entered the yard, then entered the church. It was open, but nobody was there. I have rarely went to church until now, I have to admit. Never been a true non-believer but, like most people in my country and, I guess, most Christian world, I went to church on events, like weddings, baptisms, funerals. At best on Christmas and Easter. Or, in some extreme conditions, when I was in need. We found, eventually, the lady who worked at the church shop and we were told the parish house was the first house down the road.  We went there. It was a small village house, one level, classical architecture for the area. There are some old houses in Bucharest as well like this. Father George was in the yard, working. He did not wear his priest cassock, but work clothes. Almost 60 years old, but still a strong man for his age, tall and pretty imposing. His beard was neatly trimmed, and the cheeks were clean shaved. He greeted us and opened the gate.

&#x200B;

”Father”, I begun, ”I do not know if you remember me. We met during the case of (censored name and location), I was the reporter who talked to you back then. ” ”Yes, I remember you now. You lied on camera.” ”Yes; i did it. That is my job, to lie. But I want to tell you I have not lied enough, and for that I was about to loose my job. I was suppose to say there was no possession and that you were a medieval conman.” He showed a very small smile at the corner of his lip. ”Is that so? Better then doing all the harm to the end. But lets see why are you here. Come on in.” ”Thank you, father. This is my good friend, Adrian.” After shaking hands with Adrian, he invited us at a table in the garden, near the house. He served us from his stock of raki, a traditional drink from the Balkans, made from anason, that in modern Greece is called ouzo. A pretty strong alcholic drink, similar to whiskey or scotch at this regard. Fortunately, like the similar Romanian tzuika, made from prunes, it was drank in here from minuscle glasses, and those were only half full.

&#x200B;

”My relatives from Albania ship me two times a year raki. Made by them. Always prefer it to tzuika. Far more flavored.” I usually do not drink strong alcohol, but now I felt like doing it and, since I was not driving, I guess it was ok. On a hot summer day, even in shade, it had a strange refreshing effect on me. ”So, ” he started, ”What brings you here? Most likely you need my services that I am famous for. Isn„t it?” ”Yes, father.” I replied. ”I think I am in trouble.” I showed him the scars on my chest and neck, especially the bite mark. He looked intrigued and silent. ”What caused all this?” ”I do not know how to start, honestly. But I think I better showed you what I have already posted online, on a blog I have started after getting involved in all this.” And I showed him on the phone all the things I have already posted in here, I found it easier then re-explaining all from scratch. He read all in silence. He was intrigued, but also seemed doubtful. After finishing, the looked at me thoughtfully and asked: ”Do you have that diary as well?” ”Yes; i do.”, I replied and showed him the pdf file. He read parts of it, it was quite long. He seemed really interested of what was there. At least, he stopped reading, handed me then phone and started:

&#x200B;

”Yes, I know some things about the mass hysteria or whatever it was back then regarding the ventriloquist doll from Obor. You are right, there was a lot of cover up of all that, you are right on that. Gordon Jameson was person many spoke many about. I, honestly, do not know what to say about all this. I my experience, I have never met something like this. And, I am telling you, I have seen a lot. Some even darker and far more scarier then you have experienced lately. But this seems odd, it does not fit what we know about the works of demons. I mean, both of what he have from the Holy Tradition of the Orthodox Church and my own experience. But, indeed, demons can be allowed to take many shapes and their works can be very different. They are masters of deception, although the are not allowed by the Lord to disguise perfectly, at least a small detail is left out, in order to allow people who want to see the truth, to see it. And what do you want me to do?”

&#x200B;

This leaved a little confused. I was expecting for him to know what was suppose to be done next. ”Father, I do not know. I am connected to this. I think we should try to end the phenomenon, somehow. I can not take my mind of it. Like something draws me in.” ”You see, he replied, evil can cause addiction. You see, a priest I once knew said that starting to fight with demons when they do not attack is like discovering a wasp nest deep in the forest. The wasps do not attack you but you, out of panic, you start using a stick to startle the nest. You shall be attacked then. And, even if you manage to escape, you shall be responsible of the harm that comes upon you. Of course, you are attacked without provocation, you need to defend yourself. The Lord has allowed you to experience it for reason He knows. As I see it, it seems you got into this yourself. You could just leave after you were send by the network there. Now, you start to suffer consequences.”.

&#x200B;

I was not expecting this answer, I admit. Perhaps, he was right, in a way. ”But what the people who live there? Aren„t we suppose to try, at least to clean the place of any evil activities?”  He closed his eyes for a few seconds and chuckled. ”Aren„t we all suppose to change the world? We are. But most of us do not do it. Most of us can not even do it, even though, we have to at least try. Us, priests and bishops, who are suppose to be the descend from the Holy Apostles, more then laypeople are suppose to do it. But who does it? Mostly nobody. This is why this world is in the state it is. This is why people suffer. This is why two little girls became the victims of a sociopath evil sorcerer. God rest their souls! Yet, for yourself, my guess is that you should back off while you still can. Perhaps is too late.”

&#x200B;

”But father, I do not know how to say, I feel like I can not back off. That I am meant to get this over. I do not know...” I muttered. He replied with his baritone voice: ”You see, our feelings can easily be deceived. By the evil ones. Most people are not aware the evil ones, like angels, like around us most of the time. They send us thoughts, like bait. We are not aware of that, we take the thoughts as our own and the bait starts to do its work. We start to get emotionally involved and we may take them as a sign from God or who knows who that need to do certain things, but  it is the work of evil ones.This is day to day life. But sometimes, things can get even serious. Sometimes we can get false visions, sometimes dreams from the evil ones, and we can fall into a deceit so deep, that the entire reality is distorted around us and our mind becomes a slave of the deceit.” I was not aware of all these things, the father felt right, somehow, yet a voice in my head said that what I have came for needs to be done. Was it a deceit? I do not know. But something in heart spoke.

&#x200B;

”Please, father, I do not know how to put this... I need this. I think. Perhaps things have already gone to far to back off. Maybe it sound silly and childish...” He looked at me in silence then, when he eventually, talked, he said: ”Perhaps things have too far. Tell me, do you have a confessor? Do you confess regularly? Do you go to church, at the Holy Liturgy, where Christ Himself comes to Earth into the Holy Communion, in the shape of bread and wine?” ”No, father, I do not. I admit. I know, that I was suppose to, but...” I felt like a child caught doing something not right. It felt bad for me, although this was so different from what Helena did to me. ”Father” I continued, ”You see, most people are like that. You know why? Because life seems to go well or, at least, go on, without God. Without faith. Without...” I stopped. ”Yes.” he replied. ”You are right, this is how most people are. Yet, God often allows things to happen to them precisely for them to look for Him. You know, I have said this to people so many times already. As as priest, it is my duty to call you to God. More then fulfilling desires of fighting wars we were not suppose to fight.” After a few seconds of silence:

&#x200B;

”You know, all priests can do, theoretically, what I do. At need. Some priests became living myths, so to say, on this, because of people. Some people ask them, then they recommend them to other people and, if the priest is not careful, he could become involved in something with dare consequences. I was young and passionate when I started all this work with exorcisms, demon fighting and so on. I soon got recommendations from person to person, I liked the fight. You know, there is testimony that Saint Arsenie Boca would have said that that the Prayers of Saint Basil and the Prayers of Saint John Chrysostom (He refers here to the exorcism prayers, although they are, mostly, prayers to God for removal of demonic activities, they contain curses for demons and demons are asked to leave.) should be used by priests who are also monks, not for priests like me, who live in the world, and serve the laypeople, because demons shall attack their families. And it was. My wife died, my child also died. I am sure this happened because of the fight I have got into. But I did not stopped. Why? I had already lost so much, I wanted to defeat them even more. But something else was also at work. People came to me. An unworthy priest. An unworthy man. A weak man. But I realized that, when they asked my help, they asked the help of God. And I could let them down.” A few seconds of silence, then he continued:

&#x200B;

”Regardless of what we do or what we do not do afterwards, something would do good. Yourself are not in the best shape, so to say. I say I make the Sacrament of Unction at the church, for you, mostly. Afterwards, we shall holy oil from Unction, also it would make all us stronger, if we decide to go on with what you want.” I agreed. The Sacrament gave a sensation of peace, although it seemed hard to stand at it, at times. After it, he said the exorcism prayer for me.

&#x200B;

I looked at him, somewhat at peace. Adrian was trying to be there for me, as well, it seems. I do not know what was in his mind, though...

&#x200B;

”Alright”, said father George at the end. ”You still feel like coming with you to Bucharest, to that place?” I guess I still felt like that, so I replied: ”Yes”. ”Let me just a few moments for spend alone in the Holy Altar, and we shall see.” For western reader, in Orthodox Churches the Holy Altar is separated from the rest of the church by an incomplete wall. Eventually, he got out and said: ”I am coming with you.”

&#x200B;

On the road, father George explained us some things. For example, that most hautings are made by demons, because the souls are deceased human beings are in the hands of God, regardless if they go to Hell or Heaven. And they are not allowed to wonder around on Earth after death. Indeed, there are some special situations when some curses, or rare conditions, when the dead can be present on the land of the living. Demons have a strong power of deceit, of shapeshifting. Also, the fear we feel in haunted places is because of our souls react to the evil presence of demons. Helena seemed to bring a feeling of dread when she was around. He considered Helena a demonic entity or manifestation. Demons are, in their natural state, spirits without a body, like the angels they used to be. Their power of disguise can be so great that they can take the appearance of a living, flesh and blood person. Helena could be either one or more demons who pretend to be a flesh and blood being, or projections of such demons. Yet, in my mind some things did not make sense, like Helena letting me go.

&#x200B;

Father George also said that, for must people, seeing a demon without their disguise, without their mask, it would going into insanity. And seeing Satan himself would bring death. But, indeed, there few spiritually advanced people, Orthodox mystics, that can not just face demons, but command them to leave. In whom resides the power of the Living God. Normal people should not talk to demons, being to weak, demons can get their power into people, if they communicate with them.

&#x200B;

We reached the Maica Domnului street in Colentina, eventually. We stopped at a local store first, to get some water for all of us, especially after the road. Outside the store, there were some boys, aged between 6 and 9, lets say, they had the look like they would like to steal a wallet. We were careful inside, father George remained in the car. And my haunch was right, one of the boys came fast to me, grabbed my phone and ran away. I left my wallet there (Adrian was there.) and ran for the kid. The phone, among others, held the scanned pdf of the diary of Laie. Kids ran with him along some backstreets, I ran for them. Adrian came in the back, after taking the keys and the wallet from the store. Eventually, the kids came close to streets where Helena resided. I managed to see them entering a yard, with dirty houses inside, ”ghetto style”, where people who lived, mostly, on petty crimes, reside. I did not allowed them to close the gate and shouted at them: ”Give me my phone back, or else, I call the police!” I shouted. An almost middle aged woman came out shouting: ”What are you doing here? Get out! My kids did not do anything!” This is how this kind of people behave, I knew it too well. A kind of fat man also came out, shirtless, showing his tattoo filled chest. He looked menacing. Somebody else, in this situation, would have backed out. But I could not let the diary escape once again in the world.

&#x200B;

I saw the kids hiding inside one the houses, including the one who grabbed the phone. ”Give back my phone or else...” After a second of silence, I continued calmly and sharply: ”Or else the woman in black will come for all of you.” They got pale. Then woman tried to shout again: ”Get out now, my kids have not stole your phone...” ”Yes, he did stole it, I so him clearly” I cut their words abruptly. You know who I am talking about. I know you know what happened to Marcel. It will happen to you even worse, I promise you.” They were a little startled, so I entered the house and went for the kid: I continued on the same calm and sharp tone: ”Give me my phone now or the woman in black shall come for you.” He looked concerned. I pressed him slowly against the wall, then he handled the phone back.

&#x200B;

As I exited the house, I turned to them: ”You know, if keep going like that, sooner or later, she will come for you. This is her domain and she likes clean.” The woman tried to shout, but on a much weaker tone: ”Ma„am, this is life. Kids need to do this, in order to be prepared for life. This need to be skilled.” ”No!” I shouted angry. Then, on a much gentle tone, I continued: ”You see, look of how many people live differently from you. And it is ok for them. Not just that, but some get really rich and powerful without doing those things. Without being like that. Think about it.” I turned my back and exited the yard. Adrian was waiting at the gate.

&#x200B;

We reached the car and went close to the house of Niculina, where Martha pointed the the lair of Helena. We waited. Father George whispered some prayers, put on the epithrachelion (the stole of Eastern Orthodox priests), prepared his cross, oil from the Unction, holy water and we waited. It was not long and the lights went off. The gate started to screech slowly, and I decided to get out. Father George grabbed my hand, trying to stop me, whispering that he will go. But I disobeyed and went out.

&#x200B;

Helena was there, at the gate. As I knew her already. Father George and Adrian came out after me. A feeling of dread I already knew to well came from Helena, in the back, where father George was, something else, something strong and filled with light was present. Yet, I had an urge to go to Helena. ”Hello, Helena. We meet again.” She was looking a little confused, I may say, of all this. Father George came and grabbed my arm, pushing me towards the back. I went close to the car, taking Adrian with me. Father George started saying the exorcism prayers and other prayers pretty fast. Helena stood there, silent, having a strange look on her face. Father George went silent and put some droplets of holy water on Helena. She trembled a little, very little. Father George looked a little abashed. He then took oil from the Unction and made the cross sign on Helena„s forehead. Again, she trembled a bit, but only a bit. They kept on looking silently at each other. I could not see the expression of father George, but he looked confused into his own way. Still holding strong, but confused. After a few second, he pressed the metal cross he held in his hand into Helena„s forehead. She trembled a little, but remained still and silent.

&#x200B;

Father George, after being silent again a little, he turns his head on us, and his expression showed that he had some idea. He turned towards Helena and blessed her on the head, like a priest or bishop bless the faithful. And we were all surprised that Helena accepted it discreetly, like a normal Orthodox Christian would, although somewhat uncomfortable. This was abashing for all of us. Something really weird, that we felt was not suppose to be, was going on. Father George came close to Helena and whispered something to her ear, we could not hear well. Then he whispered again, slightly more authoritatively. Helena answered, whispering in her hissed voice I knew but, again, we could not hear. Father George stepped back, abashed and amazed. Helena was looking in his eyes. This lasted for about a minute, then we went back and whispered something else. He blessed again, then he came to us, and signaled us to get into the car and leave. We complied, as Helena was looking at us.

&#x200B;

As Adrian drove off towards the exit from the city, father George, finally spoke out: ”You have no idea what I have seen in my life. How powerful demons, what shapes they can take, how deceitful, how scary, how toxic they can be. I am sure I have seen, virtually, nothing of what they can do. Yet, something like this I have never seen. Something I do not understand. How to make sense of it. What I can say, Ruxandra, is that it seems you were right. This is not a demon or a manifestation of demons. She accepted the blessing, the cross, the oil and I even managed to get to pray like this: Lord, have mercy on me, the sinner! A demon cannot pray like this. A demon cannot pray at all. It would mean that they repent and they do not do that. But she said the prayer. ” After another period of silence, he said: ”The Lord knows what she is. I surely do not.”

&#x200B;

Darkness and light were in my soul then. As leftovers, perhaps, or more. Both I felt them both. And they were not fighting. Indeed, The Lord knows what Helena is.

Hello, My name is  Taylor Hardey. I have come across a terrifying secret in a small town I am certain most of you never even heard of... Future City. A small city located right outside the Kentucky/Illinois border by a slightly larger town of Cairo. You see I was traveling to Tennesse to on a news story however, it was late and I was falling asleep at the wheel. There is a motel in Cairo called La Center Motel. A small motel but rather nice and had free wifi. As an independent journalist, I like to do research in the towns I am in and near just in case they have a dark past or something interesting that could warrant a published story.

As I dug through the internet on relatively slow but steady wifi I learned that Cairo had a very dark past. Involves heavy racism and the near genocide of the African American community that once lived there before the massive floodings. However, the more and more  I look into it the more I see mentions of future cities. How some of the black community fled to Future City to seek refuge from the floods and lynching that was taking place in Cairo. So, the natural curiosity got the better of me so I kept digging and digging and ultimately found... nothing.

I thought to myself how such a prominent town with the name of Future City has less than a paragraph of information on hand about it. Despite it not having plumbing or police there was next to nothing about it. It was almost as if these things were scrubbed clean off the internet. So I did what anyone would do in my position. I looked up the nearest local library since (if you didn't know) libraries are an excellent source of LOCAL knowledge that you can't find on the internet since it's usually in old newspapers etc. So needing some sleep I laid down for the night and planned on going to the library in the morning.

Waking up I was feeling unease much like nausea but with added anxiety. At the time I didn't know what could cause this so before heading to the library I went to the store and buy some antacid. I just went to a gas station not too far from my motel. A small quaint store Called "Cairo Food Mart". The dingy off-white walls and the faded red top made it feel as if the store has been there since the 40s. Entering I was greeted with a "Hello". I simply waved back and headed to the aisle that had over-the-counter medicine like aspirin and Tylenol. I grabbed the tums and got to the register the cashier looked at me and asked. "New in town or just visiting?"

I looked at her and gave her a warm smile "Oh just passing through but I am curious about something. I am a journalist and besides the library is there any other source of information I can get for the future city?" Her warm smile turned into a slight snarl "Why do you want to know about Future City?" I was a little taken back by her sudden aggression. "Oh... Uh ... I am not trying anything to harm anyone I am just curious about the past." She seems to relax a little but told me sternly "It's best that you stay away from Future City. There's nothing good or interesting there" She seemed so adamant about this that I dropped the point entirely but knowing full well I'm still going to the library. "Ok, I trust your word. How much are these Tums?" She told me $4. I paid for it and walked out leaving more determined. "What the hell could be scaring the locals so much that they refuse to speak about it... or they are hiding something"

After I left I took the medicine and almost immediately felt better. However, the looming feeling of dread was still there. As I got to the library I noticed it's more of a museum than a library with a ton of historical items strewn throughout. There's even a meeting room on the first floor with chairs and a podium. I looked around the memorabilia and not much hinted at anything to do with Future City. I felt defeated for the first time since my mother passed away. "Why is this getting to me so much?" I questioned myself while running my fingers through my jet-black hair. I tried one more time because maybe they too are hiding something from the public eye. I saw a leather-bound journal of n unnamed person who lived here at the time of the riots and subsequent massacre of the African Americans that once lived there.

I carefully opened the case grabbed the journal and tucked it into my jacket. The librarian at the time was in the bathroom and didn't notice me going in or out so I left in a hurry to my motel room. "Now I am cooking with gas!" I thought to myself while being excited over my first true lead. I sat down at the motel on my bed and while wearing gloves I turned the first page slowly. At first, it spoke from the perspective of an African American man who worked at the steel mill that was operational before the riots. The journal describes how the young man tried to work every day to feed his family until something horrific happened.

The man had a daughter named Rose. He saw the future in her eyes and felt happy when she was born. Unfortunately, this was during the peak of the riots and the African American community was being bullied out of town by a neo nazi group called "The White Hats". This lead the man and his daughter Rose to attempt to flee from the town and hide out in ... Future City. "Finally, I am getting somewhere". I exclaimed in excitement. The next few pages were the worst and I almost vomited reading them. The man explained how the white hats came into his makeshift home in Future City and stole his baby. Before he could run out he was hit on the back of the head causing him to pass out.

In the morning he came to worried franticly looking for his daughter. He noticed they left track going deeper into the woods and he pursued. Upon reaching a clearing there was a large bonfire in the middle with the men sleeping around the fire. The young man who was furious at this point said he lost control killing them in their sleep with a large rock. Smashing their heads in until it was a fine pulp. After they were dead he searched the area for his daughter... moments into looking around he saw her dress burnt up at the fire... and a small child's corpse.

The man in the story revealed his name to be Joseph and he swore to curse both towns until they rot to the ground. I couldn't help but feel for Joseph he lost everything I cried for a long time as empathy took over. I never felt this level of intense sadness ... "IS this what it feels like to lose a child" I said clutching my chest. I wasn't too sure what got ahold of me but I never in my life felt this pain. I went back to the library holding the book still in my bag. I looked one more time through the records and I found Joseph was later tried and hanged in the streets of Cairo for the murder of those four men. They didn't even entertain the fact he lost his child to those.... monsters.

I kept the book.  I know I should've returned it but I feel as if something was asking me to hold on and return the book to him... Joseph. That night I was lying in my room and I heard growling outside my window. I turned to look at the curtains and there was an outline of a shape that I could see. Despite my entire body telling me to turn back and run I opened the blinds. However, nothing was there... "I guess it's just my imagination," I said after sighing. I pulled the journal out again to thumb through it. And It dawned on me. The whole city could be hiding the fact his child was murdered but why? I wanted to find out badly so I went to bed knowing what to do next. Search the woods of Future City.

I got into my car and turned it over. I sit there and check my mirrors and when I got to put on a seatbelt I get a flashback of a memory I never had before. It was multiple men dragging me to the middle of a field... I felt as if they tossed me on wet wood that smelled heavy with gas. As I struggled to get free I feel a hammer come down on my feet.. snapping the bones and breaking my feet. The pain was so immense all I could do was stare at my feet as bones were sticking out and the warm blood steadily poured out. While I was still distracted the hooded men poured more gas on me. 

They... they looked like demons. Dancing, yelling, laughing, and cheering. Who could do this to another human? I was still alive as they tossed a match at me lighting my whole body on fire. I felt my skin crackle under the intense heat of the pyre. The smell of cooked flesh filled the air as these demons screamed at me in anger and hate. The last thing I saw was my vision getting blurry assuming my eyes were melting. As fast as I fell in I fell out... I sat there with tears running down my face and the time seemed like it skipped tonight. Something wanted me to help them... me to show the truth. 

I headed to the woods that matched the description.. not much has changed but the buildings decay. The town of Future City is in dismay. No public water or sewage and no police. It's a pseudo-lawless land that had so much potential before the riots and floods. As I headed down the street to look for the derelict gas station that matched the description in the journal. I kept seeing people on their porch side-eyeing me and looking at me with anger and hate. There weren't many people there but it was about four. 

I found the old station and parked on the side. I hoped out grabbing the journal and walking toward the woods. Each step felt.. familiar... I was only following what the journal said. As I was walking the world was changing around me in and out of existence as if I was walking in Joseph's shoes. Each step was the same and the overwhelming feeling of anxiety was washing over me again. I felt sick to my stomach and almost heaved but something told me to "keep going, save her". I kept marching on past many rows of trees to finally reach the outcropping. At this time I was in Josephs's shoes fully and the men who kidnapped his daughter were lying there sleeping. I see the dress on the ashes of the campfire and the smell of human flesh was present... Then I noticed something the child's burnt corpse was on the pyre.. her legs were broken... 

I snapped and lifted the same rock joseph did all those years ago and began to smash the heads of the murderers in. It felt way too easy to burst through their skull... felt like a watermelon but ... warm. I didn't stop after the first swing... Joseph wanted them to be unrecognizable... One by one until all four were dead. I then went to the burnt body and held her close to me sobbing and crying to god why...

The memory was fading when I heard "Hey boy you lost? You don't belong around here" A large chunky man spoke to me in a deep southern twang and I yelled out "No just returning something to its owner". In my head, I was still clutching the baby but it was just the journal. I placed the journal on the ground and stood up. "I'm just leaving"  The man then approached me "No you don't understand you know too much and youre not leaving here alive boy". I heard a shotgun cock and cold steel press against my neck. I would've been dead if a miracle didn't happen. The only way I can describe it was divine retribution. 

The spirits of the Rose and Joseph rose from the ashes and knocked the man on his ass. He began to scream as they dragged him to the place where the fire was. It was then I heard his bones start to break... every ... single ... one cracking and distorting and finally his neck was twisted a full 180 degrees. The spirits looked at me one last time and the fire was lit consuming the large man. I stood up and watched as Rose rode on Josephs's shoulders and they both approached a bright white light on the other side of the clearing. 

I ended up passing out and waking up in the field in the morning. Nothing remained of the large man but his gun and ashes... I walked away and toward my car. The overbearing feeling of anxiety was finally lifted and I felt... free. I don't think I am quite done with Cairo or Future City... Stay tuned friends.

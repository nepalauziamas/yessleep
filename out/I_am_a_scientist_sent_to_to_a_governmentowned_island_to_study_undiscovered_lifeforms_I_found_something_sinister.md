I never thought I would uncover the horrifying reality I did.

I am going to keep everyone anonymous. I have changed names to protect the not-so innocent. 

I am aware of how by releasing this document I am likely to be in trouble with my higher-ups. They are powerful people who have a means to destroy my reputation. They could even end my life and make it look like an accident or an unsolved homicide. I don’t care. 

Let them come after me. 

I have to get this information out to the public. I owe it to humanity. 

My exact title was physical oceanography scientist. My station was at NASA headquarters for most of my career. My job duties in consisted of reading information gathered from satellites. I also helped map the ocean and checked everything from sea levels to salinity. I became familiar with eyes glazing over when I described aspects of my way of making a living to friends.

Still, every so often I would go out on a research vessel I will call the Pulver. Although that is not the actual name of the ship, that is what I will refer to it as from here on out. 

Many in my profession would have been content in a room with stacks of photographs taken from space. 

I wanted to be out in the field. I volunteered to go wherever they asked. I was still young, unmarried, and childless. Traveling was a welcomed privilege of the job. 

I did not expect to go to an unnamed island that my colleagues have referred to as death’s acreage. 

I could not predict what I would see next.

\*

My boss called me into his office. His name was Robert Barr. 

His professional dwelling was a clean area with a marble white desk. The entirety of the chamber was nothing but glass with NASA logos. 

On that particular day something seemed off about his demeanor. I would soon find out what was bothering him.

“Would you be open to going to an island in the middle of the Pacific?”

I made eye contact with him and observed how he looked tense. His skin was paler than usual. I guessed he had not slept the night before. He was twitchy.

“Of course,“ I said. “I’ve always told you I will go anywhere you need me.“

“Don’t tell me what you think I want to hear,“ he said he slammed his hand down on the desk.

Workers walking by in the hallway peered inside after they heard his sudden outburst. I leaned back in my seat when the noise of his palm hitting the surface reverberated throughout the room.

“This is serious,“ he said as he wiped sweat off his brow. “This is not for NASA alone. It involves parts of the government that we usually do not collaborate with. Homeland Security, to name one. This is not going to be within your comfort zone. You will receive a challenge with this one. If you come back with a positive mental attitude still intact there will be a promotion. It’s a huge pay bump, and it will secure your future here in a way that no other assignment can.”

“Is it still on the Pulver?” I asked.

“Yes,” he said.

“May I ask what this entails, if it’s outside of my typical tasks?”

“You will know on arrival, but let me give you a few details. You will study undiscovered forms of sea life. You will study specific lifeforms found in and around this particular island. The bit of land in that archipelago has been completely guarded by the US military ever since the Cold War. You may not know this, but people in your position studied the dying phytoplankton. At the time the paranoia towards the Soviets were so high. They theorized the Russians may have been killing sea life. Has anyone ever told you that before?”

“No,“ I said.

I did not know why he decided to share that with me at the time, though I learned later on how he was inferring a warning. It was indirect, but I should have caught on still.

A long pause settled between us.

“There will be nondisclosure agreements you will have to sign,” he said. “You must not tell anyone about anything you are about to see you when you get there. This is true whether it is mundane or from another world.”

His wording struck me as odd. I should have seen the red flags in that moment. I had an inward speculation on how he was in a caustic mood with possible problems at home. It was well-known at headquarters that he was going through a divorce.

“So, “he said, “are you in?”

“Again, yes.”

We shook hands and I signed the necessary paperwork. 

It was the greatest mistake of my life.

\*

Pulver was two hundred and seventy feet long and fifty feet wide. It had four decks. The interior had state of the art computer systems and navigational equipment. 

The day I walked onto it, I saw two other crew members. One was the captain. He was an experienced seafarer who I knew had an extensive an impressive background in the Navy. His name was Hugh Rockwell.

The second was a man whom I had met several times. 

Teddy Strickland.

He smiled and tried to give me a friendly pat on the arm. I did not reciprocate the warmth. Fact of the matter is, Strickland was well known in the community, but not in a positive way. He a pseudo-scientist. He believed in New Age concepts. This guaranteed him spotlight on the history channel. Their more outlandish documentaries stoners love to watch had him in their credits. He was not known as a reliable source of innovation within our field. 

Strickland only maintained validity through being a sort of one-hit wonder. He built a specific device which helped with particle sampling. This invention was a great aid at the time to many of us.

I could not understand why they would pair me with him, though. It angered me.

I forced a smile at him, and tried to remind myself that I did not have to work too close with him. I could do my own thing at the other end of the boat. I would lock myself away in my cabin and still be useful without his interference.

As soon as we were out to sea, I walked onto one of the decks and rested my elbows on the railing. 

The shimmering luminescence of the water as the lowering sun left me awestruck. The lapping tides reminded me why I chose to make this my life's labor.

“You could’ve become a fisherman if you wanted to stare at the ocean all day,“ Strickland said. He had a wide grin and elbowed me in the side. 

We had not even been away from the dock for more than an hour. I fantasized about throwing him overboard. I yearned to watch him drown as I pointed and laughed at his isolated and slow demise.

“Come on inside,” he said as he pointed towards the center cabin. “There’s some pictures I have to show you. They wanted me to.”

I went into the space with reluctance. Rusted and rotted compasses lined the countertops. 

Situated on a table sat a stack of papers. Upon closer inspection I saw that they were black and white aerial photographs.

“What about this one strikes you as…bizarre?“

When I held it up to the light, I saw the anomaly he had referenced. It was a picture of a shallow part of the ocean near the island. 

Yet there was some thing beneath the water and near the shoreline. It was in the shape of a face. It had jagged teeth and eyes which were triangular shaped.

“Isn’t that weird?“ Strickland asked, as though his commentary was insightful.

“So it’s some kind of demonic entity,“ I said. “Hippies have cloud spotting where they see all kinds of different things. Some individuals see a million different items in the same Rorschach test. It doesn’t mean anything without a trained psychologist to tell us about our psyches.“

“Sure,“ Strickland said. “Yet I did not tell you what I saw, and you described the exact same thing as what I interpreted it to be.”

\*

It was four long days of twiddling our thumbs and awaiting the arrival at our destination. The air grew colder, whereas I expected humidity based on the region we were in. This baffled me. Still, I did not want to get lost in the muck of speculation on weather patterns in the age of global warming.

The island came into sight. Its crescent shape was visible. Its many rosewood and wild lime trees dotted the landscape. It was comforting to see land again, even if I knew the elements would kill almost anyone if left unaided on it for long.

Then I looked down. 

There were copious amounts of yellowish algae. I had never seen kelp tinged with such a golden hue before. It had an unhealthy and almost radioactive appearance.

I saw a large reef fish swim into the labyrinth of scum. What I saw next left me breathless. 

The yellow algae had come to life and wrapped itself around the fish. It was like the algae had a consciousness and was some kind of  being with sharp tentacles. 

The fish transformed into a cloud of gore. The impact of the creatures death should not have effected me, but the smell did immediately. A wafting of putrid viscera wafted towards me mixed with the brine.

I pinched my nostrils and felt as though I was going to throw up. 

Strickland came out perplexed and looked at me.

“What’s wrong?“ Strickland asked.

“Nothing,“ I said. 

I refrained from telling him the truth. Strickland believed in extraterrestrials seeding our oceans with cosmic foreign technology. Still, he would label me a crackpot if I were to tell him seaweed was becoming sentient.

The incident bothered me the rest of the night and I did not sleep at all.

\*

I crawled out of bed the next morning exhausted. 

I pulled back the blinds over my window and stared straight out at the island. 

Something about the way the trees swayed in the wind seemed to beckon me. I had a longing to be on its beaches, if only to walk on soil again.

As I peered out at the coastal stretch, I saw Rockwell. He appeared from the jungle. He had a semi automatic rifle strapped to his back. 

He held a canteen and a wooden block. I reasoned it was a club or some kind of weapon.

He got into a light blue kayak and meet his way back to the Pulver. 

Once he was aboard, I went up to meet him after I grabbed a cup of instant coffee. 

“Glance over the railing and tell me if you notice anything about the bottom of the vessel,“ Rockwell said.

I did as he instructed, and noticed how the yellow algae was starting to swarm upwards. It was as though it was trying to cover our home on the ocean in it’s web-like texture. It seemed to only do so while we were asleep or preoccupied.

“I’ll have Strickland take a piece of it and see what we can find out about how it spreads,” I said.

“You should wake him up now, then.”

“So we’re allowed to go out there?” I asked as I pointed to the sandy and verdant scenery.

“Barr told me to let you know it’s ill advised,” he said. “They trust me to go out there because I know how to handle myself. Somebody who looks through microscope’s all day may not. No offense. Hey, I need you to analyze something that I’ve collected.“

He set the chunk of wood down. I observed that there was lettering carved into it, but it was not done in a sloppy way. It was woodwork created by an artist’s hand. The back had ornate and elaborate symbolic designs. They were almost tribal but far from familiar.

The single word on the front was English or Spanish. I had never read it before. Still, it echoed something in the lexicon I may have stumbled upon decades before. In all capital letters it read:

CARCOSA

Outlining the top and bottom of the word were purple-blue crystals stuck in the wood. They shimmered in the light of the rising sun.

That was when we heard the scream. It was a shriek, and I recognized it as Strickland’s voice.

We rushed downstairs. Rockwell kicked down the door after we found it locked.

What I saw next will live in my memory forever.

He was in his death throes.

Strickland was still on his bed and was laying on his back. Yellow tendrils of the algae had wrapped around him like rope. Despite the visceral terror I felt, my constant use of deductive logic made me analyze the scene. I tried to figure out where the algae had invaded his cabin. When I looked north of the room, I saw how the living mass had crawled through a shattered part of his window. 

Parts of the kelp had pierced through his abdominal section. The algae which had dismembered his center had a talon-like end. The sharp protuberances of its head formed a mouth. Pustules, scabs, lesions, and vicious infected cuts littered his body. 

“Retreat,” Rockwell said after he pointed to the ground. The algae came towards us. 

Rockwell unstrapped his rifle and aimed. He fired. 

When I saw the projectiles, I realized they were actually rubber pellets. Each time one of them hit the creeping plankton, it seemed to mutate and contort to get out of the way.

Still, it moved in our direction. 

I kept backing up. When my shoulder hit the wall, I noticed a large slithering chunk of the algae above my head.

“To the kayak,” Rockwell said to me as he shoved me down the corridor and back onto the main deck. He whipped around and continued firing as he took steps in reverse. He screamed the entire time, pausing the war cries only when he reloaded. 

Once we were in the canoe, he handed me the paddle and told me to get us inland like our life depended on it. I did and we managed to reach the shoreline within a matter of minutes.

Rockwell had an emergency phone which he used to call headquarters. 

It was three hours before an emergency helicopter came and picked us up. 

I watched as the Pulver sank into the depths. 

\*

Once I got back home, I took a long shower and popped a few sleeping pills. I slept for two days straight. After I went back to work, I walked into Barr's office. I told him I wanted no part of the research project anymore.

“You’ll suffer a demotion,” Barr said with a growl.

“I'll take it,” I said.

Over the following three days, my career took a harder hit than what Bar had even prophesied. I left the company altogether. They did offer me what they described as a lateral transfer. In reality, it was a pen pushing job in Ohio which involved organizing Excel spreadsheets. I declined.

To this day, I have no idea what actually murdered Strickland. I don’t know what that thing was or how to classify it. My mind has made several educated guesses. I have thought about everything from a bio weapon to a new strain of bacteria. It could have been an inexplicable phenomena deep beneath the aquatic firmaments. 

I hope it never travels beyond death's acreage.

THE END

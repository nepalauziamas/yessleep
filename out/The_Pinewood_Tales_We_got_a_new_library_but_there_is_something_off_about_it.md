  

My name is Alexander, but as you’ve probably guessed, that isn’t my real name. The following events I’m going to tell you are based in a town you have never heard of, and probably never will. If you somehow figure out the location of this town, **don’t ever come here**. But for right now, I’ll just say that the name of my town is Pinewood. Located in the Northeast part of Minnesota, our town is small, not like your average small town though because as you’ll come to learn, there is a reason why the population stays as it is. 

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

“Welcome everyone! Welcome to the Pinewood County Library!”. This was the somber tone of the tall and freakishly skinny man who was calling out to the crowd. He was around 7 feet tall, give or take. Wearing black from head to toe, his clothes fit the somber day that many of us have gotten used to. Many of the town people knew this man, some called him Jimmy, others called him Slim Jim, a nickname that he had grew to hate. 

“As we begin our tour today”, he said in a more upbeat tone, “We will showcase what a great job our board did with putting together this library!”. As we made our way to the front doors, there was a weird feeling growing in the back of my mind. Me and my friend Jess had to come to the library today to see what we could get into, but my mood had turned as we got closer to the new library’s doors. Jess had been my only friend for my whole life, given how I’m only 19, I hadn’t made a lot of friends in this tiny town. She has been my neighbor for 13 years, as she was the same age as me, but she had lived in a town about 400 miles away from our tiny town for the first 5 years of her life. 

“You know what’s funny?”, I said. 

“Oh no, not this again”, Jess replied. 

She knew what I was going to say before I had said it. I always liked brining up the fact that I was a year older than her. 

“I am a year older than you. Literally 365 days apart. Who would have guessed that you would move into our tiny town and give me a best friend who shared the same birthday”, I said, laughing slightly as I did. This had always been funny to me, as Jess was really the only person in town whose birthday was close to mine. I was born on October 30th, the day before Halloween, which was funny to me, as I hated the so-called holiday. 

“You know what’s even funnier to me?”, she said as she was waiting for me to take the bait. 

“Hmm, maybe your time of birth?”, I had snickered back at her. We did this all the time, having playful banter as a cornerstone of our friendship. 

“Wow!!”, Jess yelled, maybe just a little too loud, as the seven other people in our tour group had given us a side eye. “You know if I was born two minutes later, we wouldn’t share the same birthday?? Hmm did you know that”? She had began to poke me in me side, a gesture she knew I hated. This behavior was normal of us, as we liked to kid and play around each other. I’ve overheard some of the town-people talking about us and how we should just date already. 

“Jess, why don’t you just sit there and look pretty and maybe we could have a decent tour”, I said as we began to go into the new building. This was how I liked to mess with her. Giving her compliments made her a little flustered, something I liked doing. 

As we began to walk into the new library, I began to notice how it stuck out. Our town was tiny, with the layout of the town being a few buildings in the center and being surrounded on all sides by trees. It was like someone took an apple slicer and cut out a small hole in the forest and made a little town. Now I wont tell you what all we have in our small town, as that would ruin some of the other stories I want to share. But I’ll say this, our new library stuck out like a sore thumb, one that had been beaten with a hammer and put in a cast. 

To give you an idea of what our town looked like, just picture the town of Forks. Yes, I am talking about the town from Twilight. The somber tone of Forks was a perfect comparison to our town. We only had one café, one grocery store, one post office, yada yada, you can picture it. Our town grocery store was a small general store run by Mrs. Thomas, but it would be better to call her Ms. Thomas as her husband went missing two and a half years ago, although she swears she still sees him around town.

Now, imagine a two-story library next to an outhouse. You got it? Well that’s what it felt like, as this new building that opened before us was beautiful, and the small post office that set next to it, well, that’s the similarity I’ll give you. This new building was situated at the edge of the circular town, as it sat on top of the old library, which had been abruptly closed two and a half year ago, around the same time Mrs. Thomas’ husband went missing. 

Me and Jess finally went in with the rest of the group and came across a beautiful statue in the lobby. The best I can describe it is that it had the legs of a gorilla, the torso of a cat, one arm was a tentacle and the other arm looked as if it belonged to a human. However the weirdest part of it was that it had a head of an elephant and in between its ears it had the horns of a goat. It looked as if some hunter had a fever dream and had made a mount of his favorite hunts. 

This sight made our tour stop for a minute. The only description at the base of the 4-foot-tall doll was one word, “Casemiro”. I was baffled, I had never seen such a creature, and I’m guessing that neither had anyone in our group. 

“Excuse me”, I had spoken up at the back of the group. Jess gave me a confused look but smiled at me nonetheless. 

“Yes, Alex?”, came from the front of our group, presumably from Jimmy. 

“I have two questions. One- What the heck is this. And the second one, who the heck put this together?”, I had asked as I was genuinely confused. 

Some of the other people in our group started to talk amongst themselves, and I’m guessing that they had the same questions in their mind. “Well, as it was described to me, ‘it is an artistic masterpiece put together by out top donor, which is where most of the money for this library came from’”, Jimmy had answered as if he had practiced that phrase in the mirror. 

Jess had poked me in the side, “Hey that kinda looks like you”, she said as she pointed at Casemiro. 

“Haha very funny”, I had mockingly laughed back as we continued on through the tour. 

It is a very nice library, with the upper story housing the fiction and historical documents. The lower part of the library was just like any other library, with computers, open areas for studying and story times, and other play areas that kids could sit and play with toy cars and such toys at. However there was a door at the back corner of the library, one that was beside a window that had looked out into the back behind the library. 

“I have another question. What is behind that door?”, I had asked as I walked towards it. 

Jim looked as if he was in a panic as he had stepped in front of the door ahead of me. “Well that is the basement, but you don’t want to go down there, that’s where the old library is, ya know?”, Jimmy had said as he struck up a sweat. 

“Yeah, that’s fair, wouldn’t want anyone getting any kind of diseases from the old library or anything, they might turn into an old librarian”, I said as I had started laughing. I’ve always tried to be funny and was mildly successful as some of the people in the group started to laugh also. 

But Jimmy didn’t laugh. He had a look on his face that I couldn’t discern any emotion from. The look was hidden from the group, but I could tell that he was disturbed by what was truly down there. Needless to say, I didn’t have any more questions for the rest of the tour, as I stayed in the back of the small pack of people who were OOH and AHH-ing at the features of the new library. But Jess knew there was something wrong, as she asked me what was wrong. 

“Oh nothing Jess, I’m just enjoying our tour and thinking about how much I’ll like this place”, I half-heartedly said, and it was a pure lie. Jess knew that I didn’t like libraries, I was more of an outdoors person. Thankfully, she didn’t say anything else about it, but just went through the rest of the tour with her arm in mine. 

Our friendship was weird to say at the least. We had been neighbors for 13 years and had been really good friends for all of that time. There had always been a weird tension between us, as we never confessed any feelings we had about each other, but just enjoyed the time we spent together. 

As we were finishing the tour, I couldn’t help but think of the door and how Jimmy had blocked me from getting near it. Why would they build this place on top of the old library? I tried to put this in the back of my mind as we were led to the entrance and out the front doors. 

But I couldn’t help but think, **what is behind that door…**

[I decided to revisit the unnamed haunted house](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/y01jyo/ive_been_visiting_and_reviewing_haunted_houses_in/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), as I'm choosing to call it. After sleeping on the idea for a couple of nights, the fright that I originally felt from my first experience turned into sheer curiosity as to what could be going on inside that house. But you know what they say, curiosity killed the cat, right?

On the night after I posted about my first experience in the house, I had a nightmare where I visited the house again. Call me a masochist, but this only made me want to visit the house again more. I'll spare you the details of this nightmare for now, but it becomes important later.

As I approached the house for the second time, everything appeared precisely the same from the outside, except for the light that turned on on the second floor. This time, no lights turned on when I walked up. The driveway, the signs on the front yard, as well as the black fog in the front door were all the same as last time.

When I walked up to the front door, I waited for a moment in anticipation of the hand gesturing me in again, but it never did. It probably recognized me as a returning visitor. Before walking in though, I padded myself to make sure I had everything I wanted to bring in for safety precautions. This included my flashlight, knife, and a bit of holy water freshly blessed by my local priest. Hey, if you were in my situation, you would probably do the same thing, don't judge me.

Whoever runs this place didn't hesitate to scare the hell out of me as soon as he had the opportunity. As soon as I stepped into the entry hall, while I'm still enveloped in the black fog, two hands grab my shoulders. I struggled for a good ten seconds before they finally let go and got out of the fog. Whatever grabbed me was nowhere to be seen, but it was kind enough to leave some of that black goop on me. I still haven't been able to get that goop out of my shirt. I've washed it three times.

Most of the haunted houses in my area don't have any sort of physical contact between the visitors and the people performing the scares. The ones that do have special permission from the city and visitors have to sign a waiver before entering. Given that this haunted house doesn't have a name, nor have I signed any waiver, I'm assuming this house doesn't have such special permission.

Regardless, I move on.

Because the note I received after my first visit said it was different every time, I came in expecting the worst. The hands grabbing me was bad, but a good haunted showrunner will save the worst scare for the end. Though, if he's expecting me to be coming back multiple times, I highly doubt he's considering my second visit the end.

As I gathered my bearings and got up, I looked around the entry hall to see if anything had changed about the house since my first visit. It was still a normal-looking house, but some of the furniture was moved to different spots and there was no longer a lamp on the entry table. My first thought was *oh, is this just some sort of spot-the-difference game*?

No. No, it wasn't.

One thing that was the same, however, was that the TV in the living room was still just playing static. If I was gonna stay there for longer than before, I wasn't gonna deal with listening to TV static the whole time. So, I grabbed the remote and tried to turn it off. It still didn't work. I even went to unplug it, but the static still persisted. Too bad I didn't bring my earplugs.

I wish I could say that was the end of the TV shenanigans. Every time I exited the living room, the static would stop. And every time I walked back in, the static would continue. I was terrified at this point but also impressed. The owner of this haunted house was clever, you don't see stuff like this in haunted houses that often.

I decided to give up on the living room for now and move on to the kitchen. I start investigating a few things and notice that the kitchen knives were somehow secured in the knife block so you couldn't pull them out. This was strange, but it made sense as a safety precaution, you don't want to leave a bunch of sharp weapons out for people. Especially in a haunted house this secluded and not well known.

Another thing that I took notice of was the breakfast table. There was food on all the plates. And not even just some basic breakfast stuff, like a whole breakfast meal. Eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, you name it. You'd think I would have been able to smell it, but I couldn't smell anything. I inspected the food and it was real. I ate some of it. It was delicious. And I'm still alive to write this, so it wasn't poisoned.

I couldn't help but feel like I'm being placed in a false sense of security. Was this a haunted house or a bed and breakfast? I'm not sure, but I still had my guard up. I decided to go upstairs next. The black goop was still on the railing, which I avoided touching.

It was at this point that I started getting a little suspicious. I'd been there for almost an hour and the only scare I had gotten was the one at the beginning. Sure, this is a lot more intricate and mysterious than a typical haunted house, but I figured there would be more to keep me interested.

That line of thinking was a part of that false sense of security.

As soon as I got to the top of the stairs, I got an overwhelming feeling like something was watching me. Sirens began going off in my head. This wasn't your typical *I feel like someone is watching me* sort of feeling, this was an imminent feeling of terror. I looked at every window within view. Nothing. I even got my flashlight and shined it everywhere. Nothing. I don't know where this feeling came from, but there was *nothing* to be seen anywhere.

Yet.

I began looking around upstairs. The nursery was the same and all the bedrooms were the same except for one, the master bedroom. When I opened the door to the master bedroom, I immediately noticed somebody sleeping in the bed *fully covered* under their blanket. This person had to be incredibly tall, their feet were almost hanging off the end of the *king-size* mattress.

Okay, pause. Who the hell sleeps like this? Don't you need to breathe to sleep? Silly me, this is a haunted house. For all I know, this could've been the corpse of the previous owner who was murdered in cold blood by a local fisherman who disappeared immediately after the incident.

I didn't walk into the room. I closed the door and walked away. I really wanted to leave, but I made a promise to myself that I would stay for the "full experience."

As soon as I started walking back downstairs, I hear the static of the TV start again. Normally, it would only start when I walked into the living room, so I was curious. I returned to the living room and grab the remote yet again. To my surprise, the remote wasn't completely useless this time. The TV actually turned off when I pressed the power button on the remote. I then turned it back on, then back off, then back on, over and over again. It was all still static, I couldn't change channels or video sources, but at least I could turn the TV on and off. This was progress. Now, I still have no idea what I was progressing toward, but it's progress nonetheless.

The black goop guy didn't like me messing with the TV.

For a split second, while I was turning the TV on and off, black goop guy appeared and disappeared in the blink of an eye in the reflection of the TV. I immediately dropped the remote and turned around, but he wasn't there. He did leave some black goop on the ground, though.

This was my cue to leave. This visit was long enough, so I immediately ran to the front door and ran out. But not before picking up yet another note left on the ground.

*Why not stay the night next time? You can have the guest room.*

The owner must be crazy to think I would stay the night in this haunted house. He might be right.

It was too quick to gather any details, but this is the best description of black goop guy I can give. He's tall and slender. Humanoid in shape but not human in appearance. Not human skin, more alien-like. Pitch black in color. Next time I visit, I'll try to get more details, but that's all I could see.

I don't think I have enough information to review this haunted house yet. I need to figure out what's going on in that house. Everything seems real. I need to go back.

But do you remember that nightmare I mentioned? Well, that's how this whole situation goes from a really good scare to what I think is legitimate supernatural activity. I forgot about the nightmare while I was in the house, but after my second visit was over, I realized something. Everything I saw, every step I took, every decision I made, and every sound I heard was completely identical to the nightmare I had before. This isn't just a haunted house.

So I woke up at the counter again this morning at 6:30, right when my shift starts. It’s something I’ve grown accustomed to, but it’s an issue I haven’t quite solved. I sleepwalk, and don’t know what I do, but I know I always wake up here at the counter working at the convenience store. So, what I’ve started doing to see what “sleep me” has been up to, is I’ve started using a body cam. But, the thing is, I just went to work. I think this is a good time to mention my name is Mark. But, I’ll write a transcript of what’s been going on, and after I see my doctor again, I’ll see if I can post another night.

9:00 PM - I went to bed, and started the body cam footage. 

10:00 PM - I began snoring

12:43 AM - I sat up, and moved my legs off the bed

1:00 AM - I began getting up

1:01 AM - I Used the bathroom and brushed my teeth

1:06 AM - I ate a bowl of cereal, and used up the last of the milk 

1:09 AM - I began getting dressed in a black shirt and jeans 

1:12 AM - I got out cat food, and put it in a bowl

Note - I don’t own a cat. I’ve never owned a cat and I’m allergic to pet dander. I’ve also never bought cat food. And it’s weird. I could have sworn that’s where I put my canned goods. 

1:19 AM - I grabbed my backpack filled with books, and a computer for when work is slow.

1:20 AM - Began driving

1:30 AM - I opened the convenience store, and turned on the lights.

1:35 AM - I put on my workers Apron and began working

3:45 AM - A man I’m not familiar with came into the store, and we began talking

Note - We began TALKING. You see, I’ve researched this. When you talk while sleepwalking, it doesn't make sense and is connected to what you’re dreaming about. You don’t just have a conversation with some random joe, who walks up to you. But I also want to talk about the guy. He looked off. He was stiff, and I can’t tell if it was the body cam, but it looked like his face was way longer than it should be. So were his other features, like his arms after putting a pair of chips on the counter, and grabbing cigarettes. And made a joke about not smoking. 

4:00 AM - The man had bought chips, and some cigarettes. Paid with a 20 and left without taking change. He entered the store fine, but he had to bend over, and grab the top of the door to not not hit his head when leaving.

5:03 AM - Some people came in, confused, since we don’t open until 

6:30, but just bought some road snacks and left.

6:29 AM - The body cam, which is placed on my shoulder, suddenly fell right behind the counter. It was still on my shoulder, but I believe I had passed out, and the sudden drop was me hitting my head on the counter.

6:30 AM - I suddenly wake up, and look around.

That’s around when I turned the cam footage off. It’s about 8:00 AM after I started watching. With speeding up the footage, and dividing my attention with the usual early bird customers. I might also talk about some of the stories that have arisen from what sleep mark’s been doing. Maybe I’ll write about the pig Incident next, since it’s one of the first stories I’ve been told about Sleep Mark. Anyway, I need to catch up on sleep. I’m incredibly tired. See you later.

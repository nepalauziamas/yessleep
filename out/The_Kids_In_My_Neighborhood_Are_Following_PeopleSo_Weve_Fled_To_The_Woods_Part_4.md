It’s hell getting old. The donut tire gave out about halfway down the dirt driveway of the cabin where Sammy was hiding out–which meant we had to walk the rest of the way. It was only about a mile, but *what* a mile. 

Slippery gravel and eroded dirt. 

No place to sit down and rest. 

It hurts my pride to admit it, but by the end of it, Cayden was practically carrying me. 

There were no lights except for our flashlights and the stars. 

I’d always hated walking through the woods at night, the way the light turns the branches into bare old bones. My own grandfather dragged me along to hunt down a rabid dog that was loose behind his farm when I wasn’t much older than Cayden, and I’ll never forget the mad look in that slobbering animal’s eyes when I pulled the trigger.

It was half-hate, half-horror: the face of a living thing taken over by something outside its control.

I hadn’t seen anything like it again…until I saw the Silent Kids. 

I would have preferred to face *ten* rabid dogs rather than see a group of *them* come walking out of the woods. I could see the cabin up ahead, a black square in the darkness. It had seen better days. The roof was covered with dead branches and pine needles, and there was no light inside the dirty windows.

“Uh, Rich? I dunno about this….” Cayden whispered. “Do you still have the gun?”

I did, but tired as I was, I doubted I could even aim straight. 

Something rustled in the bushes. It was…*barking?* 

Monster, Sammy’s golden retriever, came running out to greet us. Two headlamps struggled through the trees behind him. 

*Sammy…*and a wiry middle-aged guy in full camo. They were dragging a blue tarp between them. *A deer.* As soon as he saw us, the middle-aged guy dropped the tarp and racked his shotgun:

*“The fuck are they?!”* 

“That’s Rich, Uncle Hugh.” Sammy explained. “My neighbor. And…?”

“Cayden.” the kid waved nervously. 

“You told’em about this place?! Jesus, Sam! I’m not runnin’ a goddamn refugee camp up here…” Sammy’s Uncle Hugh had the round, wild eyes of someone who’d spent a long time far away from other people. It was a look I’d seen in some of my buddy’s who’d gone to ‘Nam, and I didn’t like it at all. 

“Rich tried to save me from *them.*” Sammy explained patiently, “and Cayden here looks pretty strong. We need someone like that if we’re going to be staying up here for…*for a long time.*” I noticed she was still wearing her suburban-power-walking outfit, with one of those fuzzy green Army surplus jackets zipped up over top of it. She looked drained. not only from the nightmare happening in our town…but also from handling her Uncle Hugh.

Hugh scratched his cheeks and sighed. They were gaunt and stubbly; I wondered what he’d been living on out here in the woods. 

“Well, you’re here now.” Hugh grunted. “Might as well make yourself useful. We gotta get this meat smoked before it spoils…” 

A few hours later, we were all packed into Hugh’s tiny cabin. Its single room was lit by a bare generator-powered light bulb, and heat came from a potbelly stove, the same one that warmed the canned beans Hugh offered us for dinner. Generations of cans were stacked high on every wall–I think I even spotted some cobwebby Crystal Pepsi up by the ceiling. There was barely enough room for the four of us (five, counting Monster) to sleep in front of the stove. I’d forgotten how chilly it could get in the woods at night, even at the end of summer. 

“I’m gonna go check the perimeter again.” Hugh grunted. He’d been twitching nervously on his cot for the past hour, unable to sleep. “Maybe set some traps.”

‘*Traps?!’* Cayden looked at me with alarm. Sammy covered up a smile and rolled her eyes. The door slammed, leaving the three of us alone in the cabin.

“Hugh’s a lot to handle, but he means well. He used to be a university professor. Ecology. When he saw the direction the world was going, he taught himself all this stuff and moved out to the cabin to wait for the apocalypse.” She laughed bitterly. “I don’t think he knows what to do with himself now that it might actually be here.”

“Those kids…they followed you home, didn’t they?” I asked. Sam took a long rattling breath. Whatever had happened had traumatized her, and I didn’t want to make her go through it again. “Look, if you don’t wanna talk about it…”

“No.” Sam shut her eyes and shook her head. “You need to know what we’re up against. For me it had been a normal afternoon. I’d gotten back home with Monster and I was just turning the key in the front-door lock when I saw their shadows on the porch. They were right behind me, and before I could say anything, they’d pushed me inside. They had this dead, emotionless look on their faces…like puppets on a string, y’know?” 

I nodded; I knew. 

Sam went on: “By the time *you* came to the door, they’d locked Monster in the downstairs bathroom, and three of them had grabbed knives from the kitchen, like…*like they were gonna make a salad or something*…all at once, they held fingers up to their lips. That’s why I didn’t say anything to you…” Sam sniffed. 

“They put zipties on my wrists and marched me into the woods…they never said anything. Not a word, but I think that somehow they were communicating…*or something was communicating with them.* It was getting dark by then. They took out their phones to light the way. The screens had this weird red glow…”

Cayden and I exchanged a glance. 

“It made my head hurt, like something was trying to worm its way inside…finally, we came to a trai…and I actually recognized it. It led to a place where we used to party back in high school, up on the hill beneath the power lines. Know where I mean, Cayden?” 

“I don’t get invited to a lot of parties.” Cayden shook his head. 

"...well, anyway, it *used* to be a cliffy little hill overlooking the town and the river. But now, it's…different. Some of the cliffs have sort of collapsed. There's this cave…"

Sammy paused. This part was hard for her. 

"Who knows how far down it goes. The kids brought me to the edge of it and I felt hot, wet air blowing up from it. *Like it was breathing.* It smelled like rotten meat, and when I looked around I saw sneakers, shirts, dirty jeans in a pile…everything was lit by that weird red light, and I realized what was going to happen. Whatever was down there…they were going to *feed* me to it." 

"So how’d you get away?" Cayden asked. The kid’s voice was pure suspicion.

"They threw me down on the rocks. To strip me, I guess, before they threw me down into the pit. But when I hit the ground the ziptie snapped… and I ran." 

Cayden and I looked at each other. Sammy was cute, and honest, and *kind.* I liked her. But it was hard to believe that she’d just *given the slip* to a pack of Silent Kids…in the woods…at night. 

"Sam…" I began, "Are you sure they didn't just…let you get away?"

"...*What?!*" Sammy at our skeptical faces. "But...*why?!* Why would they do that?!"

"So that you'd lead them to others who know what's going on!" Cayden shouted.

"You don't really *believe* that, do you Rich?" Sammy asked. Cayden was watching me too, waiting for a response–

But I didn't have one. My joints felt like they were on fire after the short walk to the cabin, and I was too tired to think straight. I didn’t have it in me to be the wise old man, not tonight. 

We heard a single lonely gunshot from somewhere in the woods. 

Monster got to his feet and started barking–

And then all hell broke loose.

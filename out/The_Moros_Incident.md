I took this job thinking about the money.

*Fuck,* a six digit pay cheque is enough to make anyone dream of the opportunity. How could I say no? With Elizabeth at home, with her medical bills piling up…

Of course, looking back at it now, I realised I was offered this position because they *knew* I fucking *couldn’t* say no, those damn pricks.

You don’t understand how bad I could just call them out on this right here and right now, but I know I’d have a bullet in my head in minutes if I even dared type their name in this.

You’ve seen Whistleblowers postings, you’ve read the tale of the kid from that town.

Well now it’s time you hear about me, and my encounter with the truth.

All I know is that Whistleblower’s got some large boys in his pants to be doing what he’s doing. Call it inspiration I guess, because seeing him do it made me realise more of us should. Hell if I know if it’ll make a difference in the end, but it’s worth a shot.

Better that we let you know what’s coming now before it’s already upon us all.

My name…I guess I can’t give that out, under the whole “if we say too much we’re dead” thing. Call me Jack Frost. I’m a fresh recruit to the organisation; they hired me in January, had me trained and debriefed by the middle of March, and I’ve been here, at Outpost Sigma-3 ever since. I’ve been tasked with security detail in this underground facility in Alaska, which in itself is a pain in the ass. Add a cluster*fuck* of abnormals, what we call the creatures the organisation deals with, and some crazier than Doctor Frankenstein lab rats, and you get the picture of what my day to day life is like. 

For the most part, my job is peachy. A whole lot of standing around with the other guards, toting our rifles and shock sticks around, pushing around the nerds.

It’s high school all over again, except I’m on the fratboy side now.

My main job is to ensure no outbreaks happen. Usually I follow the scientists into their testing areas and stand there watching them poke and prod these fucking things like their emotionless husks.

And I can tell you with certainty, some of them seriously have my sympathy with what these fucks do to them.

Like Mother, she’s a Low Level Threat, but I won’t get into her right now. Maybe Whistleblower can dig up her file for you at some point.

The whole reason I felt the need to come clean was what transpired about two weeks ago when our acquisition team brought in a subject that to me looked…different…than the rest.

It was a kid.

A little girl, maybe twelve years old.

She had this deep red hair that was long and it covered her face at first, so I didn’t initially see that she was blind. They’re pulling her in by the neck with this pole and choker device, her hands chained behind her and her feet also chained together, poking her with a cattle prod like she’s some fucking fearsome thing. One of the lead researchers met them at decontamination to ask them questions about her, like where they found her and what she was doing. They were very hush hush about the whole thing, and I didn’t make out much aside from one of the captors saying she was brought here for something called the “Moros Test”. I thought nothing of it.

At first.

Days went by and there was no sign of the girl, no talk about her. Usually I can pick up from the lab rats talking about what's up with a new abnormal, but none of them were speaking about her. Finally, curiosity got the better of me so I decided to start snooping around.

For six days, I found nothing. No sign of her, and actually no sign of the scientist who took her away. I scoured the entire facility and found nothing.

I looked in the Top Levels, and there was nothing new there, just our Darwin, our Wraith and Slither, and a few others.

I checked the Low Levels.

Nothing.

I looked around in the To Be Assessed section, nothing.

And then I found her.

Just when I was ready to give up on this whole thing, I found a room I usually passed. It was one on the second floor of the facility labelled “Moros Lab”. I avoided this room as much as I could because the last time someone went in there when they weren’t permitted, well, they ceased to exist, legally speaking.

Something was in my head on this day, however, and I just couldn’t shake the feeling that I had to see what was on the other side.

After seeing Whistleblower show the world some of the truths, it made me begin to wonder.

If we’re tasked with keeping secrets from the world, what secrets are being kept from *us*?

I entered the room and was met with blackness for a moment, before the automatic lights flashed on.

In front of me was a large switchboard, full of buttons and levers and keyboards. It looked like something out of a sci-fi flick…then again, basically everything here does I guess.

The room was cut in half by a large glass panel; the other side was still black.

I could hear something, however, coming from the other side.

Some sort of movement.

I walked up to the switchboard and looked it over, trying to find a way to turn the lights on on the other side. 

I noticed a screen on the switchboard flashing “awaiting input”, so I tried typing in the word “lights” and just like that, what was on the other side was illuminated, and as my eyes looked upon it, my blood ran cold and my mind went quiet. 

On the other side of the glass was a chamber, its walls were made of metal bars, each lined with barbed wire and electrical wire wrapped around that.

Inside of the cage were three things.

Firstly, there was the scientist, dead. He was broken in half. Still connected…but his spine was snapped in two and he lay on the ground with his head touching the back of his feet. His eyes stared out in my direction, but I could tell he was more than dead.

Beside him was a pile of skin and bone, topped with red hair.

And beside *that*…was this fucking thing I could not explain even now that I think back on it. 

A pile of flesh, moving, breathing. It was leaking so many forms of liquid, I felt like I could smell it from this side of the glass.

I could see parts that resembled arms and legs, but broken down and in some ways just not exactly what they were supposed to be. It was as if someone had ripped the girls innards out and blended them together.

I don’t know how long I just stood there and stared at the thing before I finally managed to take my eyes off it and looked down, noticing a clipboard on the floor. I picked it up and what I read was the nail in the coffin for why I had decided to start spilling this places fucking secrets.

Read the file. Understand that this thing, this…Moros, was the beginning. They’re about to open the fucking hell gates on us all.

Start preparing for the end, everyone.

“The Moros Test is a series of biological, neurological and chemical tests administered to a subject in hopes of creating the ultimate being. Through our research on abnormals, especially that of the Darwin species, our team at Site SIgma-3 of the \[REDACTED\] Organisation hope to achieve what the majority of humanity already believes: us, on the top of the food chain. For too long have these creatures been wiping out large scale numbers of populations across the globe for us to sit back and allow this to continue. We hope to bring on a better world through forced evolution.

Subject Name: Louise Volkcheck

Age: 13

Weight: 120 lbs

Height: 4 feet, 2 in.

Family: Only father, removed upon acquisition

Notes: It would seem after numerous attempts to see any significant change, Louise was another failed candidate, or so I would have believed until today. Upon entering the lab room, I noticed the girl on the ground, holding her stomach. At first, I believed that she was going to pass away like the others, but then the metamorphosis began.

Her body began to convulse and an acrid smell permeated from her cell. Although it was noted that she was blind, colour appeared in Louise’s eyes again and she looked directly at me even in her state. 

Her bones began to bend and break in her arms, the bone snapping out of the elbow and continuing to do so until the entire arm bone was removed from the flesh. The same would happen to the rest of her skeletal system until the girl was now a pile of flesh and bone, leaving behind her skin. The mound began to move rhythmically, as if it were breathing. I believe this to be so.

It then began to reform itself, but it would seem that it didn’t know how to do so.

At first, it seemed to look human as it formed two legs, a torso, and two arms.

When it got to the head, however, things turned around. It was close, I could see the formation of the brain, then of eyes, a mouth, but quickly everything collapsed inward on itself, leaving a grotesque form of flesh on its shoulders. Following this, for whatever reason, the same would occur to the arms as they melted inward to the torso and meshed together with the pile of the head as it disassembled itself. A sound could be heard from it, like a pained scream that was covered beneath the sound of bones cracking and flesh tearing.

For a moment, I believed it was dead…but then I saw the movement. It began to breathe. It began to eat itself and create new, always failing to form anything substantial, but nevertheless living. 

The same essential process then occurred with the legs, and this new creature was born!

I know not its capabilities yet, nor do I know how sustainable it is. Further testing is required.

I will enter the cage and see if it is able to function in a moment.

This is our first successful creation, and if it can do what we have been hoping for, then we can move on to phase two.

For the sake of our future, I pray this is it.”

I need to say this. I entered the room, I had to see what the creature was capable of, how it had killed the scientist. As I approached the cage, I began to realise that the lab rat seemed…empty. 

Then I realised he was. This pile of fuck must have taken out his innards for itself. How, I don’t know, but it surely was disgusting to look at even more upclose.

I could see the eyes, swirling around in the mass, looking everywhere. Hands would begin to form and reach out in all directions, only to melt back into itself. A mouth appeared for a moment, and it let out a low humming sound before it too disappeared.

I stood there, staring at it. 

And then one of the eyes looked at me.

At that moment, the creature moved at such a speed I didn’t even manage to comprehend what was happening. It entered the scientist, melting itself down to fit into every orifice of his body. The husk shook and writhed as its body was filled with this thing.

Then, like a marionette puppet, he stood up, his body shaking still. It looked down on me.

“Consume.” It said, “I will consume.”

If this is the beginning, what in the holy lord’s name is phase two?

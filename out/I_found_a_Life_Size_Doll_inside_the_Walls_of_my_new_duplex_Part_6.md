I held the [note](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/wgymtk/i_found_a_life_size_doll_inside_the_walls_of_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) in my hands, rereading it a couple of times. 

“Meet me at my place if you want answers-Bill”

This was an invitation that I should have rejected. I should have called Macie’s dad, told him I wanted him to come pick me up or anything to get away from the duplex. I should have run. 

Instead I told myself that I needed to know. 

That whatever Bill had to say would make the world start to feel normal again. 

I knocked on his door ten minutes later, note in hand like a courier. 

“Trish, glad you came. No knives this time, right?” he asked. His house was still mostly dark. 

“Turn on your lights and then I’ll come in,” I said. My voice sounded so numb. I was done with all of this shit. All I wanted was to find Macie. 

“Sure,” he replied, stepping back inside. A second later the lights came on and he called out to me, “You can come in now.” 

I pushed the door open, my eyes immediately focusing on the dining room table in his den. 

He was sitting there, fully dressed like it was a family meal and on the opposite side… the doll. 

“Why the hell is this thing here?” I snapped. My instinct was to just bolt but something in my neighbor’s eyes said not to. 

“Please. Close the door and have a seat with us and I can explain,” he insisted. I did as he told me, walking over to the table; noticing that the doll was now wearing different clothes again, matching the nostalgic charm that Mister Langford had on. Yellow blouse. Black skirt. Short puce heels. Her blue eyes seemed brighter, her unchanged emotionless face a little more lush. 

“Thank you,” he said with a strained smile. 

I didn’t respond. I was too uncomfortable being this close to the doll. 

“I wanted to… apologize for lying to you,” he began. I did my best to not laugh. But he noticed my body language and immediately gave a stern expression. 

“Do you want to hear what I have to say or not?” he snapped. 

I sat there, almost as motionless as the doll as he started to talk. 

“Anyway, I wanted to apologize because I wasn’t truthful about Andrea. When you arrived, I didn’t want you to judge me for any of my… lifestyle choices so I had hoped that putting her in that closet would keep my secret. Seems fate decided to take a different course.”

“I guess I don’t blame you for acting the way you did about her. It would have probably freaked me out too. But she’s perfectly harmless. Just a reminder of my past. A sin I can’t ever be forgiven for,” he said as the left side of his face twitched. 

Was that a lie? A poker tell? I said nothing, letting him continue his story. 

“No matter what I want you to know that I loved my wife, I loved her. And I still love her. That’s why I did this. I couldn’t lose her. I just couldn’t.” 

“I see that on your face when you talk about your partner, Macie. That drive to do whatever is necessary to be with her and make things work.” 

“Don’t think we should be comparing relationships Bill,” I whispered. His face twitched again. So I was catching him in a lie. Which part of this story was even true?

“The point is we do a lot of crazy things for the people we love. Things we probably thought that we would never do until the moment arrives and we are forced to do them. In those defining moments it ain’t about what’s right and what’s wrong. It’s about what has to be done.” 

“Was one of those defining moments when you murdered her?” I blurted out. I just couldn’t hold it back anymore. I was tired of the bullshit. 

I kept a steady icy glare on him but Bill didn’t even seem surprised by my accusation. 

“I guess I should have figured you’d hear that from someone,” he admitted. 

I opened my mouth, thinking of mentioning Sarah’s name. But then wisely closed it. I didn’t want to feed him any information. I needed to know what he did and then form an opinion. I was tired of the lies. 

“What happened was an accident. But you’ve met the police around these parts. If they saw what had happened I would have lost Andrea that night and Penny too. I couldn’t afford that.” 

Penny. So the story Sarah had told me was true. Or at least what he was saying matched up with the words of a living doll. Whatever the hell that meant. 

“Where is your daughter now by the way?” I asked. This time I kept my voice calm, trying to make him think that I believed him. If any of this would help me find Macie, that was what mattered. 

“Not right now,” Bill said mysteriously. “Please let me finish my explanation.” 

When I didn’t respond he took that as an invitation to continue. 

“My neighbor Rose, there’s a few things about her that I didn’t mention,” he said, clearing his throat. “I guess we get the big one out of the way first…. She was, for the lack of a better term, a witch.” 

The look on my face must have told him that I didn’t believe that horseshit. But yet at the back of my mind, a dull voice wondered if he was telling the truth. I remembered the pictures of her goth clothes and saw them in a new light. The dolls… were they the work of witchcraft?

“She must have been real fun at neighborhood cookouts,” I said dryly as I crossed my arms. 

“I didn’t believe it myself either. She actually told me the first day she moved in. Said she didn’t want to spook me. I told her that I didn’t give a crap about her new age astrology shit. Yeah…” 

He looked over toward Andrea and sighed deeply. 
“That night I did care though. I asked Rose to save her. Anything, I begged; anything for my wife to not have to die.” 

The room felt suddenly much colder as his tone got darker. I could tell this was no fantasy. Every word out of his mouth was the reality of what happened. 

“She said she could do it. But there would be a price to pay. I guess there always is with these types of things. I was so drunk, so shocked by what I had done… I told her I would pay for it. I didn’t care.” 

“She took Andrea back to her place. Did whatever kind of magic Mumbo jumbo, and then when she came back… she was like this,” Bill said, gesturing to the doll. 

“That doesn’t sound like you got what you wanted,” I whispered. I almost realized it didn’t match up with the story Sarah had told me. Was either version the correct one?

“No shit? I was fucking furious. I demanded that she fix it. But she said that Andrea would be fine. ‘She’s more alive now than she ever was before,’ Rose said. She instructed me that in order for Andrea to be… human, someone else would need to take the place of the idol. Like a split shift. Sometimes Andrea would be human, sometimes not. That was the only way.”

“The soul can be housed temporarily, but you have to watch it carefully. The soul also wants to leave and move on. That’s why you have to keep it moving. The transfer keeps that from happening. In between you will need to keep an eye on it or keep it from moving about. Follow those instructions and you will never lose your family. I never forgot those words..”

“I told her to prove it to me, prove this magic was real and she said she would. She explained it would have to be someone related by direct bloodline to house the transfer,” he told me. 

His lips were trembling and my neighbor looked like he was about to cry. 

Then his phone beeped an alarm and he stood up, almost robotically and went to the door of the guest room and unlocked it. 

A little dark haired girl appeared from the room. 

“I can come out now?” she whispered. 

My head felt dizzy as I watched her dance into the den and she looked toward the doll. 

“Oh… I guess my time is up isn’t it?” she whispered. 
She reached for a knife from the cabinet almost like it was instinct. 

I moved to stop her but Bill held me back. I wanted to scream.  Immediately she cut her wrist and blood pooled out like a faucet. She held it against the lips of the large doll. 

As she did this, I heard Bill talk. 


“So I did pay a price. And I had no idea how fucking heavy of a price it was going to be.”

I watched, too mortified to make a sound as the lips of the doll seemed to become flushed with color. Followed by her face, her eyes and her hair. The doll began to transform and become mobile, suddenly looking like a human being. 
Breath filled her lungs as the blood was lapped up into her now open mouth. 

At the same instant, the little girl went rigid and cold. As stiff as the mannequin she had just resurrected. I stood up, too shocked for words, watching as the now alive Andrea smiled at me. 

“You must be Trish. Bill has told me all about you.”

 

Have you ever heard of the Piano Man?

The   story of the piano man is something that has been passed down my  family  for a very long time. Some of us choose to believe it while  others do  not.

Like really who should believe something so outrageous?

The Piano Man is a story my family has been telling their kids for a very long time and the story my mother told me.

The story takes place generations ago…

The story may be real or fake but I’m not here to tell you what to believe?

All I know is that due to me not having kids of my own I thought I’d carry on the legacy of my family by sharing it online.

A   long time ago In a small town my family use to live in music was rare   due to everyone having to do their part in lending a hand. Everything   changed though when a strange man came into town. This man was not just   some ordinary wanderer but he explained that he was a traveling   musician. He came in with a wagon pulled by a beautiful horse as black   as the nights sky.

This excited the people of the town.

A musician? What a strange word they never heard of before.

The man explained that he came to town in hopes to play for the people.

Everyone   in the town was so excited but my family was not so much. They  believed  in one thing and that was work. Taking a break for music was  silly and  unproductive to them.

Their   feelings didn’t stop the town from wanting to listen to the mans music   so they all prepared for the man to be able to play the next night.

Something   was off about the man when they did start setting up for him to be  able  to play for everyone. Instead of taking his piano off of his wagon  he  insisted it should remain on.

Once   everything was setup that night everyone gathered around the wagon in   chairs listening to the man play. He never gave a name for what he was   playing but it made everyone have the sense of relief and even made  most  people drift off to sleep.

He   played the piano for which seemed like hours until everyone left. The   music felt enchanting. It gave them all the feeling of some form of   nostalgia. Like seeing a sibling after years of being apart or enjoying a   favorite food from childhood.

Everyone   fell asleep peacefully that night without any stress keeping them  awake  but something awoke one of my family members. He could hear the  sound  of a piano being played but the sound was getting slowly distant.  He ran  outside to see if the Piano Man was playing something new in   excitement. It was hard to see anything though due to the morning mist   scowling the area. He followed the sound of music until in eyes view he   saw the wagon being moved and he could hear music coming from it.

He also noticed something else following behind the wagon small silhouettes of people…

Immediate fear began to fill him when the fog began to clear up and saw the man playing the piano better. That was not the only thing he saw through the silhouettes of the people were children.

The   man playing the piano didn’t appear to be the same man as before   either, something was different. The music may have been as beautiful as   before but he was different. The normal colorful skin he had before   appeared to be a pale white and his eyes radiated a beautiful red   crimson.

The Piano Man locked eyes   with him and began to change songs and he woke up in his bed. He   believed it all to be a dream until he went outside to find everyone out   searching for their children. Everyone was in tears losing their  young.

He  urged the people to go  after the Piano Man and that he couldn’t have  gone far and that he  believes he was the one who took them and that what  he saw couldn’t  have ever been a dream.

People   told him that he was crazy and that it isn’t funny to make up such a   fallacy when they are all freaking out. No ones ever even heard of a man   called the Piano Man.

When they   told him that they never heard of the Piano Man who came into town a   couple nights before, he told his family about everything. Most didn’t   believe him and called him crazy. He swore to find the children out of   guilt of not being able to stop the man. He promised he would be back   but sadly he never came home.

This story has been passed down my family for a long time. Even if the  story isn’t true and nun of that ever really happened I think something we  can take from the story is that we shouldn’t be so reluctant to  trust strangers. No matter how nice someone may seem or how they dress or look  they could just be a monster in human skin.

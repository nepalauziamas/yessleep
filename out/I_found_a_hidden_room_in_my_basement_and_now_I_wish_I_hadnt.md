Fort Collins has always felt like my happy place. There’s enough diversity to remind me that I exist, and the culinary options are pretty good. The mountains are right freaking there and offer anything and everything you could want.

Everything turned out to be more than I actually wanted. I found a journal in a hidden room in my basement. I recently wrote about it and transcribed the entries. I wanted to update what’s been happening with anyone interested.

I woke up Thursday at 3:15 am. The sound of metal dragging on wood brought me out of my usual peaceful sleep. I’m always ready for an intruder, so I grabbed my handgun, racked a round, and headed out into the dark hallway.

I live in one of the oldest homes in Fort Collins. It’s a 2-story with a basement. My bedroom is in the northwest corner of the top floor. Directly below me is my office. It could be a bedroom, but I like to keep a separation between work and life.

The sound was coming from the main floor. I stood in the hallway, trying to judge what room it was coming from. After a few seconds, the sound changed. It went from metal scraping on wood sound to a rapid pattering of bare feet. I know the sound of bare feet in my own house. My nephews were here over the summer, and they never wore shoes. I’m not too fond of shoes in the house. Slippers are fine, but shoes have piss on the soles. If you’ve ever been in a public restroom, you know what I’m talking about.

The pattering sounded like a couple of kids. I almost put the gun down, thinking my sister and her kids had snuck in for the night. They do that when in the area, and it’s too late to call me. I called her name out, then the names of my nephews. No response.

The pattering started up the staircase, coming straight at me. I flicked the light switch, and nothing happened. Fuck.

My mind went to my phone. I quickly activated my flashlight and shone it on the corner of the hall that went to the stairs.

The pattering kept coming. Little kid steps, moving fast. They went to the top of the stairs and turned away from me, heading to the room at the opposite end. I didn’t see anything moving until the bedroom door flew open.

I want to preface this next part with the Big Bang Theory character Sheldon. He consistently reminded everyone that he wasn’t crazy because his mother had him tested. I am the same way. I don’t think I’m crazy, but that might be the crazy trying to cover its tracks.

Inside the bedroom, I saw something. At least five kids were sitting on the floor. I’m not one to put much credence in ghosts, spirits, or the like, but goddamned if all my hairs stood on end.

The kids looked like they were from another time. A few were dressed in ragged, home-stitched clothing, while others were Native American. I started to say, “What the fuck?” When the door slammed shut. The pattering steps were gone. I was left standing in darkness and silence.

I stormed down to the door and threw it open with more force than necessary, banging a hole in the plaster of the wall. The room was empty. A second later, I felt this terrible sadness and sense of loss.

Then, as I was reeling from the sudden change in moods, the pattering started again. This time it was coming from straight in front of me. It came at me fast, then I was lying on my back, and the pattering went down the hall to the stairs.

I heard the front door open, then what sounded like an insidious laugh or cackle. I stood up and made my way back to the stairs. Just as I took the top stair and started down, every door upstairs flew open hard, crashing into the walls and making a huge racket.

There are three bedrooms, two closets, and two bathrooms on the second floor. Every one of the doors was thrown open. My room looked like a tornado had hit it. Clothes were everywhere, my dresser drawers had been pulled out and thrown around the room, and the primary bathroom had been ransacked. The shower was on full blast, as was the sink. Steam filled both bathrooms as I checked them.

The hall bath was steamy and disheveled but otherwise unremarkable. My bathroom, on the other hand, was torn apart. All my toiletries were strewn about, and the steam accumulation on the mirror had been written in.

It said, “Why did you let it happen?”

For the life of me, I can’t think of anything I “let happen” to anyone. I doubt the message was for me, but it doesn’t matter. That shit freaked me the fuck out.

As I picked up my room, I heard the front door open again. This time the house filled with the scent of cooking meat. It smelled off, though. Like the meat wasn’t prepared properly or had been sitting out for too long.

Then I yelled at the top of my lungs for whatever it was to knock their shit off, and everything stopped.

I sat on my bed, ready to bolt for the stairs when a knock came on the front door.

I apprehensively walked down the stairs, aided again by my cellphone flashlight.

My neighbor stood there, shivering in the cold, dressed in pajamas and a thin robe.

She wanted to know if I heard the kids outside. She said they were throwing rocks at my house, screaming how “You’s is going to pay.” She and I have had dinner together a few times. She’s a very kind woman in her mid-fifties.

As we talked, I could see in her eyes that she was intensely uncomfortable in my living room. I asked if she’d like me to walk her home, and she happily accepted before I had all the words out.

When I said goodnight to her, I turned back to my house. In the bedroom on the southeast side, I saw a man looking down at me through the window.

His face was etched with wear, and he wore a strange hat. I can’t place where I’ve seen one before, though I know I have. I’m thinking it’s some sort of fundamentalist religious attire.

As I watched him, he smiled and began waving. His hand waved, but nothing else on him moved. It almost appeared that he was a cardboard cutout of a human with an automated waving hand.

I turned around and knocked on my neighbor’s door. Hard.

After what seemed like several minutes of me feeling the piercing eyes of the man in my window staring at me, she answered. She looked like she had just woken up from a deep sleep. She was surprised to hear my story and told me she hadn’t been out of the house that night, nor had she been in my living room in weeks.

I described what she was wearing, what she had told me, and that I had walked her home. She rebutted by informing me her robe isn’t thin, doesn’t flow, and that she sleeps in a night dress, not pajama pants and shirt. Whoever I had been talking to was absolutely not her. Or else she’s fucking with me. I couldn’t see her doing that, though. We’ve been neighbors for seven years, and in that time, I’ve never known her to do or say anything that couldn’t be backed up by fact.

I excused myself and headed home. The weight of being watched grew stronger as I approached my home. I glanced up at the second-floor bedroom and was met with an empty window. There was no man watching me.

I went in, cracked into a bottle of wine, grabbed some Tylenol, and went straight to bed. As I lay in bed, I heard a few more noises from the main floor. No way was I going to check it out. The front door was locked, my bedroom door was locked, and I had my handgun. I’m thinking of buying a television and putting it in my room. People seem to be able to tune anything out when binge-watching the latest shit on Netflix. Maybe I can tune out the fact that my house is fucking haunted.

The sounds died down, and I finally fell asleep. My alarm woke me at 7:47 am. It had been going off for over 40 minutes.

I don’t know what to make of my nocturnal visitors. Were their spirits released when I opened the room in the basement? Or had they been here all along, and was I too self-absorbed to notice their presence?

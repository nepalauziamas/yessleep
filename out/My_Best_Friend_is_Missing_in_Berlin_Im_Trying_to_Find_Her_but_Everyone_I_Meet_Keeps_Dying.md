Never in a million years would I have pictured myself as a victim.  I was always seen as the strong one in my little village back home - a younger, feminine version of Father - the man who served as an example for the entire community.  He was stalwart and unshakable, and I tried to emulate him and act the same way.  

But I realize now that anyone can become a victim.  Anyone can be taken advantage of.  Lured in by false promises.  Used like an object.  Denied dignity and respect.  

I was finished with all that bullshit.  

My captor was now dead and turned to ash, and there was nobody left in the fortune teller’s shop but me.  Jayce was gone and I realized with a wave of relief that I was finally free from him.  

I had been lured from my small village in the Black Forest by him after we connected on Tinder.  He had seemed like a perfect match at first - but shortly after arriving in Berlin I discovered my mistake.  He was not a good man at all, but a despicable fraud.  By then it was too late and I was forced as an unwilling participant into the sex trade.  Jayce would have eventually killed me if I hadn’t killed him first, I was sure of that.   

Putting the strange stack of cards into my pocket with a shaky hand, I left the shop through the back door.  After running for several blocks out of sheer terror, I flagged down a cab and got in, sitting down in the back seat.  Out of breath and trembling, I held my palms out in front of me and willed them to stop shaking.  

For a moment I thought I saw a single open eye in the center of my palm, then I blinked and it was gone. 

Just my imagination, I told myself.

I couldn’t help feeling for the weight of the cards in my pocket, like a junkie checking to make sure my stash was still there.  The power of them was like a pocketful of lightning, and the thrum of energy within them reassured me somehow.  

Dark images flooded my vision as my fingers brushed against them and I realized I had missed what the taxi driver just said.  I'd completely forgotten he was there.

"Hmm, what's that?"

"My name's Dil.  Where are you headed?" he repeated patiently, his eyes looking at me in the mirror.  A man used to dealing with tourists and drunks could act one of two ways when ignored, but he kept his smile and betrayed no emotion or impatience.  

I could tell he was a kind man somehow, just by his eyes.  The voice in my head whispered to me in a reassuring tone, but I couldn’t understand the words.

“I… I'm not sure…"

He turned around and regarded me soberly.  I realized then that I had no money for the ride.  I didn’t have anything anymore.  Jayce had taken it all from me.  All I had were the clothes on my back, the cards in my pocket, and the necklace Jayce had given me.  In truth it was a tracking collar like a disobedient dog would be forced to wear - fitted with a GPS device inside of it.  

The chain was titanium - too strong to be broken by a person my size - but I tore it from my neck with the newfound strength inside of me and tossed it out the window into the street, much to the driver’s surprise.  His eyes were wide as he looked at the discarded diamond necklace on the pavement outside.     

“That looked expensive.  Bad breakup?”

"Yes, very bad.  But not as bad as the relationship…" I began, then was interrupted from my thoughts as I felt a searing pain and cried out.  

Looking down at my skin I was startled and terrified to see it beginning to bubble and boil beneath the surface - just like Jayce’s friend back at the apartment, the one who had been possessed.  His body had burned to a crisp, setting the entire apartment on fire. 

I gasped as something even more startling caught my eye outside and I found myself looking out the car window at a Berlin that no longer made sense.  

The sky was pitch black, full of pregnant purple clouds.  Silhouettes of buildings could be seen, but no lights were on inside, as if whoever lived here did so in darkness.  Forms began to approach the car - black, inky shadow figures who blended perfectly with the darkness.  They pressed their faces against the window and peered in at me hungrily.

“Are you alright, Miss?”

I was startled by the sound of the driver's voice, breaking me out of my trance.  

The world outside was normal once again.  And my arm was okay too.  Still, I waited for it to start bubbling again.  I pictured the seat beneath me beginning to melt and smoke, cinders rising up into the air.    

“Miss?”

"No, I’m not alright.  I’m not sure what I am anymore.  Can you just take me to the bus terminal, please?  I think I need to go home.  Maybe Father will take me back if I beg him.”

I said this last part more to myself than to him.  Yet still, the driver seemed to hear it and I saw his eyes in the rear view mirror were filled with tears.  

“I’m sure no matter what has happened between the two of you, he will take you back.  If he’s a good father, he will take you back.  You mean the world to him, I’m sure.”

I didn't respond.

"Ah," he sighed, perhaps sensing a darkness insinuated by my hesitation.  "Forgive me for intruding.  Off we go - to the bus station it is."

We drove in silence towards the bus terminal, and the closer we got to the place the more nervous I became.  The fortune teller’s words replayed over and over again in my mind like a broken record:

“All your life you have belonged to someone else - first you father, now this other man.”

I realized once we pulled up outside the grand old building that I didn't want to see him.  I didn’t want to belong to him again.  Not after everything I'd been through.  And not with Sabine still out there.  If I ever went back to face my father, it would be with her at my side.  

My best friend would help me.  But she needed me now, I knew that instinctively.  Just like I knew that Father would not be glad to see me.  And he would not forgive me.  

The car stopped and the driver turned to look at me.  He turned off the meter, not asking for any money, much to my relief.  I had been prepared to bolt, but I would have felt guilty for it.  

"Find your way home, okay?  Here, I want you to have this.  I feel like you need it more than I do right now."

Instead of asking for the fare, the man stuffed a crumpled twenty Euro bill into my hand, ignoring my objections.

“Why?” I kept asking, not understanding his kindness.  I hadn’t felt that from a stranger in this city yet.  So far Berlin had been cold and evil to me - but perhaps it had only been the poor company I kept.  

"If you need a reason for my generosity…  You remind me a little bit of my daughter.  I don't want to see you wind up on the streets of Berlin, okay?  Now go.  There's something bad going on in this city.  Something is happening here and I don't think you want to be around when it goes down.  Don't ask me what it will be, because I don't know.  But I can tell that something is coming.  Something very bad.  It’s like that feeling in the air when a storm is brewing - an electricity."

He was right about that, I thought.  I felt it too…  And the sensation was growing stronger day by day.    

Getting out of the car, I took one last look at the man.  We waved at each other, to say goodbye.  Despite the short time I'd spoken with him, I felt like we'd made a connection.  Like I knew him somehow, in another life. 

"Danke," I mouthed as he drove away.  

The bus station was right there in front of me, and yet I found myself unable to go inside, remembering the last time I’d tried to escape and Jayce had stopped me with his knife dug into my back.  I stood there for a long, long while, before deciding for sure that I didn't want to go home.  I needed to find Sabine.  

And, despite my growing unease and my terror, there was a burning question in my mind.  

What the hell was going on in Berlin?  And what did the fortune teller and the cards in my pocket have to do with it?

There was also the problem of the voice inside my mind, speaking insistently in another language, ancient and unknown.  This was growing distracting, and I found myself getting a headache from the constant noise.  

I sat down on a bench in front of the station, my temples throbbing and my eyes filled with a dull, painful pressure.  

There were so many people around that I felt relatively safe for the time being, but I couldn't linger for long.  Jayce had plenty of connections to his gang and there would be people out looking for me very soon.  

A vendor was selling coffee nearby and I went over to grab a drink and a pastry, thirsty and hungry after all that had happened in the brief span of the morning so far.   

The pastry was still warm - buttery, flaky, and delicious.  It melted in my mouth and the voice in my head spoke as if enamoured with the taste.  As I drank the coffee, it warmed my belly on the windy day, taking the chill from my bones.  It was mid-spring, and there was a cold breeze, the sun above shrouded by grey clouds.  

Both the coffee and the pastry were gone in a matter of seconds and my tongue was burnt from the hot drink, but I felt a little better after, and was able to think a bit more clearly.  Although it was difficult with the incessant talking of the other voice in my head.

Someone dropped a coin into the empty coffee cup at my feet and I called after them.

"Wait, I'm not…"

What was I trying to say?  

I'm not homeless.   I'm not like that.  I'm like you.  

But I realized suddenly that I was without a place to live now.  I was a "person experiencing homelessness" - as I'd heard it put once.  I liked that term better suddenly.  It was better than being put in a box, categorized and set aside as something “less than”.  

I had been judging those people before too, I realized.  

Now I was one of them.  

Another person dropped money into my cup, this time a folded bill, and I didn't object this time.  Instead, I just put my head down and muttered, “Danke,” once again.  I needed all the help I could get.

After a while I had accumulated a small stack of bills and a jingling pocketful of coins.  I tucked it all away safely into my pocket and stood up, realizing I couldn't stay there forever.  A young, ambitious-looking police officer was eyeing me from across the street and looked to be waiting for a break in traffic so that he could cross and give me the old "bum's rush."

Once I started moving he went back about his business, looking satisfied with himself for quietly scaring me away.  

This part of Berlin was beautiful, and I took a while just walking around.  Old buildings were dotted throughout, intermingled with the new construction.  Large towers, far bigger than anything back home, loomed over me, and I took them in with fascination.  

After a while I began to feel lost amongst the apartments, shops, cars and tourists, as I wandered the unknown streets.  The voice in my head was constantly speaking, never allowing me a moment of silence.  I had a headache that was getting worse by the minute so I went into a pharmacy and bought a small bottle of pills which advertised relief for migraines.  

Despite taking twice the recommended dosage, the headache remained, only growing worse.  

I sat down on a park bench, blinked, and it was suddenly dark outside.  

What the hell was in those migraine pills?  I wondered.  

Several hours had evaporated and I was now walking on a busy sidewalk, no longer on the park bench.  The last thing I could recall was sitting down with my head pounding, the sun still high up in the sky.  

But now it was nighttime and I was in front of a club with music playing loudly inside.  

At least that damn headache was gone, though. 

Normally clubs and bars wouldn’t appeal to me, but part of me wondered if the loud music (and a few drinks) might drown out the sound of the other voice in my mind.  It was worth a shot (or two, or three).  

Luckily they didn’t ID me, since I had nothing with me but my cash.  The bouncer took one look at my face, another at my chest, then motioned me inside.  

I sat down at the bar, feeling for the cards with one hand and the money with my other.  Both were still there.  

“What can I get you?” the bartender asked, speaking loudly over the music.  

“A beer, please,” I said, unsure of what else to order and hoping he wouldn’t ask for further clarification.  I had never been inside of a place like this in all my life.  The music was very loud, and I liked it.  The voice was still there, but barely audible under the bass and chattering voices all around.

After waiting for a minute I was presented with a beer.  I began to hand over some cash when the bartender waved his hand.  

“It’s already paid for.  Courtesy of the gentleman across the bar with the long blonde hair.”

He hooked his thumb over his shoulder but I couldn’t see anyone fitting that description.  Although it did remind me of someone.  Jayce.  

I took a sip, feeling uneasy all of a sudden.  But before I could spare it another thought, a man tapped my shoulder from behind.  

“Hey,” he said, looking me up and down.  This man had short-cropped brown hair, not at all meeting the bartender’s description.  “How you doin’?  What’s a pretty girl like you doing in a place like this all alone?  You waitin’ for your boyfriend?”

“No,” I said.  “I don’t have a boyfriend.  We broke up earlier today, actually.”

“Oh yeah?  His loss.  You’re beautiful.  He’s missing out.  So what did the scumbag do?  Did he cheat on you?”

I was starting to like this stranger more and more.  He was handsome too, I had to admit.  But I wasn’t even close to being ready to be with a guy again.  

Still, it wouldn’t hurt to have someone around in case Jayce’s goons jumped me, I thought to myself.  

“He did a lot worse than cheating.  Way worse.”

“Damn.  Pretty thing like you deserves better than that.  Why don’t you let me buy you another beer?” he asked, and I realized that I had been steadily drinking mine out of nervousness.  

I nodded my head, feeling a little dizzy, but in a good way.  

A little while later he was whispering in my ear and that dizzy feeling was turning into the spins.  I was beginning to wonder if it was really just beer I’d been drinking.  

Across the bar, I saw a familiar face, smiling at me as this new man was whispering to me that we should go back to his apartment.  

A man with long blonde hair was staring at me.  He looked just like Jayce.  But Jayce was dead.  

I blinked and he was gone, like a ghost who had never really been there to begin with.  

Was he haunting me?  Stranger things had happened recently, I couldn’t rule it out.  

“Come on, baby, let’s go,” the guy, whose name was Steve, was saying, pulling on my hand with a firm grip.  I didn’t feel comfortable, but felt myself complying, unable to resist.  

The room was spinning even worse now and the more I thought about it the more I realized someone had slipped something into my drink.  

I tried to pull away, but he was so strong!  His eyes flashed with something else for the first time - a momentary glimpse of his true self.  He was impatient and annoyed with me for resisting him, but I wasn’t like the other girls he’d brought home with him from the bar.  

He would live to regret this. 

Just as I was about to give in, another woman approached him from behind, whispering in his ear.  I felt his grip begin to release, until finally my hand slipped away from his.  

“Hell yeah, baby.  That’s what I’m talkin’ bout,” he said as this other woman began to rub his chest over his shirt flirtatiously from behind.  She kissed his neck and he moaned in ecstasy, looking like he’d forgotten all about me.  

She glanced at me for a brief second, her eyes flicking away to the right, as if to say, “Run!”

I slipped away.  But I didn’t run.  

Instead, after forcing myself to puke up the poison I’d been fed, I waited, and watched.  I was more than a little curious who this woman was.  She was familiar somehow.  And I wasn’t going to let her leave this place to go home with this guy unless she had backup.  Even if it was just me calling the cops from a payphone.  

An hour or so later, right around closing time, the two of them stood up to leave.  

I followed them from a distance, watching as they stumbled drunkenly down the street.  My own gait was not much steadier as a portion of the date rape drug I’d been slipped was still coursing through my system.  The streetlights seemed too bright, leaving trails every time I moved my head.  

The two of them didn’t go far, their route taking them down a side alley and then to the back of an old apartment building.  They climbed the rickety steel staircase outside which led to the second floor.  Once there, I heard a door creak open and closed and they went inside.  

Still scared for the woman (and for myself as well, I have to admit), I proceeded up the stairs after them.  

Halfway up, I paused, hearing a loud scream.  It was impossible to tell if it came from a man or a woman, shrill as it was.  

I hurried faster up the steps, panting when I reached the top.  

There was a window with a blind drawn inside, but I could peek inside through a small crack, only to make out the vaguest details.  

What I saw will stay with me for the rest of my life.  

Inside was a kitchen - its walls and ceiling painted red with blood.  The fluid was dripping down onto the floor and was splattered everywhere.

A woman was drawing on the walls with it, and I realized it was the lady from the bar who had saved me from an unfortunate end that evening.  She was drawing symbols and scripts in a strange rune-like language.  

The man who had slipped me GHB or a roofie or whatever the fuck he’d fed me was now lying on his back, spread out on the table like a surgical patient.  His chest was split wide as if open heart surgery were being performed, and I could see his vital organs shimmering and pulsating in the fluorescent light of the kitchen.  His heart was thumping in a steady rhythm before my eyes, and I caught him staring at me.  Blood poured from his mouth as he gurgled something, trying to scream - except his mouth was stuffed full.  

My eyes travelled down to his exposed crotch and I saw more blood and more cuts had been made down there.  His balls had been cut off and shoved into his mouth.  His dick had been wedged in as well, and was dripping blood from the exposed stump at the end.  Steve was looking down at it cross-eyed with a sick expression on his face, his skin beginning to turn pale and grey-green with blood-loss.  

The door beside me opened suddenly and the woman from the bar was standing in front of me.  Her hands were covered in blood which smeared the door red.  Her lips and teeth were crimson as well.   

“Emma,” she said, her voice welcoming.  “I’ve been waiting for you.  Please, come in.  We have so much to talk about.  And I have so much to teach you.”

Despite my terror, I found myself going inside.  The door closed behind me with a soft click.  

“Now, my dear,” the familiar voice said.  “There’s just one thing I need to know.”

I locked eyes with the woman, at that moment remembering where I’d seen her before.  In another life.  At least, for her anyway.

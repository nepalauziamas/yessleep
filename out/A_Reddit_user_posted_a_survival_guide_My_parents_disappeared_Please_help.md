I woke up in my bed, kind of confused. I looked around and realized my lights were still on. I must’ve fallen asleep. As I looked around my empty, but surprisingly messy room, I saw my furry little friend, Lucy. She purred as I scratched behind her ears. I rummaged around my bed for my phone to check the time. 

**11:03 PM**

I sighed and sat back, knowing I’d probably be up until 4 AM. Just then I got a notification on my phone. It was Reddit. I was intrigued, I love reading some Reddit stories.

**Read this if you want to survive. If you see this, there’s no mistaking it. It’s for you.**

Huh. Interesting title. I decided to read it because I had nothing better to do. I kissed little Lucy on the head as she slept next to me. 

This is was it said:

*This is the list to survive. If you don’t follow it, don’t say I didn’t warn you. You will die today.*

*1.) Whatever you do, do NOT stay in one place. Keep moving, but not too fast. Pace yourself. But never stay in one place to try to hide. You will fail*

*2.) I advise you not to trust your phone. It will lie.*

*3.) People you know have died will try to contact you. They will text, they will call, and you may hear their voice. Don’t listen. Don’t read the texts. Im not sure what happens if you do, but whatever it is, it won’t be good.*

*4.) Your animals may somehow disappear. They may or may not be okay. Don’t go looking for them. Just try to survive. If they don’t disappear or escape, they will try to. I think it’d be best to just let them go. They will most likely know what to do.*

*5.) Don’t trust the roads. They will trick you. You can be next to them, but whatever you do, don’t go on them.*

*6.) After 48 hours the hunt is over. For now. They come back every 17 years. Don’t try to escape them. They will follow you.*

*7.) Don’t follow the strange noises. Just don’t. Please.*

*8.) The people you meet might be fake. Be careful.*

*9.) Don’t trust the man with the blue and white striped shirt. Don’t even look at that dick.*

*10.) It may seem things are repeating as you keep moving. Just ignore it. You will be fine.*

*11.) Resting can be dangerous, just stay alert.*

*I think that’s it. Good luck, Sammy. I know you love your Lucy, but just leave her. She will slow you down. They usually find the cats anyways, sorry.*

I held my breath. Sammy? I guess that’s a common name. Is Lucy a common cat name? I’m not sure. Sammy and Lucy. Huh. I chuckled a little, realizing it was stupid to get scared at this damn survival thing. I looked over to pet Lucy and try to go back to sleep, but now she was at the bedroom door, scratching to get out. I got up to let her out. Then decided to head downstairs to grab a late night snack. 

As I got downstairs, I realized two of my cats were missing. I searched up and down for them but they had disappeared. Lucy scratched at the front door like her life depended on it. I picked her up and she scratched me. I called her an asshole and dropped her. I decided to check outside and see if the cats were somehow outside, but there was nobody and nothing in sight. It was just an average summer night. I walked around a little to see if I could find them. That’s when I noticed something.

Everything went quiet. 

I couldn’t hear anything. No bugs. No birds. Hell there weren’t any cars in the busy street. I ran home, terrified of whatever the hell scared the animals quiet. I needed to wake up my parents. That’s when I noticed Lucy didn’t greet me at the front door. That was strange for her. I ran to the hiding spot she always went to. Luckily she was there and she hopped into my arms.

“Don’t worry Lucifer, I’ll keep you safe.”

She looked up at me and meowed. I ran to my parents bedroom and knocked on the door. 

No answer. At this point I’m sobbing and my dog looked up at me, confused. I threw open the door and my parents were there. Sleeping. I felt so stupid. Panicking for this damn Reddit story? Really??

“Ma! Dad! Two of the cats are missing. Im scared. I went outside to check if they were there, but everything went quiet. The bugs, animals, and even the busy road was empty!”

“What?? The cats are missing?! Sammy what the hell did you do? How did they get out?” My mom wailed while sitting up.

“Calm down, hon. Sam, wake up your brother and keep Lucy and the dog with you. Me and your mom are gonna look around.” My dad sighed, getting out of bed. 

“NO! Don’t leave me here!!” I shrieked. 

No matter how hard I tried, they wouldn’t listen. I woke up my brother and explained everything. Even the Reddit story. My brother was creeped out, but thought it was a coincidence. He tried to calm me down. Lucy and Ags, my dog, we’re cuddled up, but terrified. They were shaking. Me and my brother watched some YouTube and shit to pass time until mom and dad got back. It’s been three hours. Three fucking hours. I’m terrified. They’re not back. Someone, please, tell me what to do. I’m only 15. Im so scared. Should I follow the guide? Should I wait?

I might update later, I’m not sure. Goodbye for now. 

Sorry if grammar or anything else is bad, my phone is laggy. I’m not sure why..[Update here.](https://www.reddit.com/user/ConsistentZombie7157/comments/w3zisf/a_reddit_user_posted_a_survival_guide_this_is/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

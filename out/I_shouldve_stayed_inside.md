Getting used to a new neighborhood is interesting, especially when you've got so many different neighbors to meet. Jane to the right, is very friendly, bringing baked goods every chance she gets. Markus, across the street, likes to interact with my pets more than me, but he's pretty kind too. Then there's Carl... He's the neighbor to the left. A cranky old man, who keeps to himself. Never causes much of a ruckus, except at the same time every night. 
Two months and like clockwork, I get woken up by the sound of him screaming at 3am. No explanation, no other sounds. Screaming and then silence. I've tried to catch a glimpse, but his fence is too high and I don't want to draw attention to myself. What else is a girl to do, but investigate? 

I purchased a couple of GoPro cameras and installed them in the tree in the backyard. Just high enough to clear the fence, but deep enough into the leaves that it can't be seen easily. I know it seems like an invasion of privacy, but I'm too curious to let it go. Perhaps he's got dementia, and needs help? But I've never seen a care taker come or go. In fact, I've never seen anyone other than him and only ever at 3am, every night or glancing out his kitchen window while im watering my garden. Tonight is the night, now we wait. I'm too anxious to sleep, even though I'm exhausted. 1am, only 2 more hours. 

I must have dozed off on the couch, because suddenly I'm jolted awake by the loud screaming again. I pull up my phone to view the feed. Strange, the camera is turned, how did I manage to install it backwards? Puzzled, I decide to sneak out into the back to check what's going on. The moment the door opens, the screaming stops, as if he knew there was a visitor. I grow brave and creep towards the fence. "M-mr. Hendricks?... Are you alright?" Peeping through the slats, I can't seem to find him. He isn't there, or anywhere. His house is dark and quiet. 

I blink and rub my eyes, maybe I'm just dreaming. Maybe this isn't even happening and I'm just crazy? I sigh and turn to head back to the house. I know I didn't turn on the lights, I didn't want to be noticed, but the porch light cut through the darkness like a knife. I must have bumped the switch and just didn't realize? Okay, clearly I need sleep. I walk to the house, grab the handle and try to turn. It's locked. Now I KNOW I didn't do that... 

A groan comes from behind me, I'm too frozen to turn around. "Mr. Hendricks?" Slowly my head turns, there's nothing there. Now either I'm hallucinating or something really weird is going on here. I quickly make my way to the front door, pull out the hidden key and go inside, locking the door behind me. I look at my phone, 6am? How did 3 hours pass in 10 minutes?I decide it's just best if I go to sleep, I'll worry about this nonsense tomorrow. 

It's quiet when I wake up, not even a bird chirp can be heard from outside. I don't even think to get ready for the day, I am focused on one thing and one thing only. That camera. I pull up my phone to check the time, but I must have forgotten to plug it in, because it's dead. I don't even notice the dim lighting coming from the windows, a sure sign it's later in the day. I groggily make my way out to the backyard, the GoPro is smashed on the ground. Even a fall from the branch wouldn't cause that much damage. What is going on here? I become dizzy and fall to the ground. 

Fast forward to 3 am. It's silent, except for the consistent beeping of a monitor. My eyes flutter open and I'm in a hospital room. Jane, my neighbor, is there in a chair beside the window. "You're awake. I was starting to think, I'd given you too much." To much of what? I thought, unable to form the words. My mind was whirling, my head pounding, what was going on? "Don't be afraid, Anna." She went on, her voice so calm it almost did make me relax. 

"We knew you were the perfect addition." She continued, running her fingers along the window sill as if she were reminiscing. "Just the right amount of curiosity. So brave." When she looked at me, her eyes were cold and nothing like the cheery neighbor I had grown attached to. I try to speak, but my tongue is tied. "Don't bother. It'll all be over soon." She whisperer, coming over to me and leaning in close. Her breath was so warm and sweet on my cheek as it crept from her lips. She smelled of those baked goods she was so famous for, but there was something bitter on the back end. 

"P-pl..." I stuttered unable to even form the word please. I just wanted an explanation. What happened to me? Why was I in the hospital? It was as if I weren't part of my own body anymore, simply viewing the scene from a set of eyes that were no longer mine. Her smile, which once seemed so sweet, now felt ominous. She shook her head. "Quiet now. The doctor will be in any moment." No sooner than the words left her, did the door open. Markus and Carl both stood side by side. "Is she ready?" Markus asked coldly, Carl not speaking a single word. "She is." Were the only words Jane had said before she began to walk away and I slipped further from consciousness. 

For the first time in 2 months, I heard Carl's voice. "Welcome to the family."

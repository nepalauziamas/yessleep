This happened back when I was seven or eight(I am thirty-five now). 
 
 We moved a lot when I was a kid, it seemed like every school year I was the new kid at the school. 
 
 So at the beginning of the third grade, my family and I moved into this slate blue two-story building with white trim.
 
I didn't learn until much later that this house had a history of haunting also no one ever in lived in the house longer than six months.
 
The first few weeks were great and uneventful. Then little things started to happen, like doors closing on their own or the TV turn back on after everyone was asleep. 

 You'd unplug the fan, it wouldn't stop spinning not full force or anything, but it would spin for an additional thirty to forty minutes after you unplugged it. 
  
 No big I could explain that away easy, I lived in a house with dancing shadow (that's a story for another day) before this was nothing new. 
  
 I would try to explain away things like when I opened the window, and it immediately slammed shut, with enough force to make the glass shatter. 
 
 Once, a family member asked who was the woman in our window when we weren't home.
 
 Once I even told my mom that tall in a suit man walked through the room and out the window but of course she didn't listen, it was always “you're dreaming go back to sleep”.
 
One night though, when it was time for bed, I heard squeaking by the foot of the bed, I remember crawling to the end of the bed to see what was going on, I thought it was mice. 
  
 There she was, a little girl about three or four years old on a little red tricycle, she was dressed like Wednesday Addams (black dress with a white collar for those that don't know).
 
She went on riding in a circle over and over, not paying me any mind, so I watched her with bewilderment because she looked more solid or real or not as transparent maybe? At some point, she noticed me, looked up and smiled.
 
Her smile was all wrong, her mouth began to grow slowly as her lips curled back, exposing teeth too big to fit in any mouth, each tooth looked to be about a foot long each, stained yellow and pitted.  
  
She wouldn't stop looking at me with eyes practically bulging from their sockets and that horrible smile, that terrifying smile.

 To this day, I remember the fear I felt when I saw that smile and how fast I ran to my mom's arms crying scared senseless. 
  
Needless to say, I wouldn't alone sleep in that room anymore, and honestly, I'm still a bit creeped out by Wednesday Addams to this day.

This is my first story I've written and posted anywhere for people that aren't my family to read, constructive criticism would actually be appreciated. My goal is to craft a story that will actually keep people up. With your help, I hope to do just that.

 When I got home, I unwrapped the magazines from my body and felt a great relief at the sudden absence of discomfort. I brewed as strong a cup of coffee as I could manage, gulped it down, and immediately got to researching.

“Marlene Toa”, I typed into Google. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary. I keyed in her name again, together with the name of my town, and nothing. Marlene Toa. It somehow seemed familiar, now that I had calmed down and had time to register it properly. But I couldn’t connect it to any memory, any piece of information. Saying her name brought up that sense of familiarity, but I kept banging into a mental wall when I tried to figure out why. Or perhaps it just seemed familiar because I had been repeating it to myself the whole way back.

Frustrated by the lack of results, I left the house. If online systems failed me, maybe I’d find something offline.

I’d head to the library first, check out old news articles, history of our town, and so on. Our town is not up to date on much, I wouldn’t be surprised if there were old archives that had not been digitised or uploaded yet. I sometimes suspect that many people in this town are Neo-Luddites. Anyway, if my library quest failed, I figured I’d simply ask around at all the establishments in town.

I drank another cup of coffee before leaving the house, just in case.

It was the usual librarian I would see at the library. She greeted me with a pleased smile. “Hey, haven’t seen you in a while!”

I smiled back. “I need some help. I’m searching for anything to do with a particular person, likely in this town.”

“Oh! Okay, who is it, and what type of information are you looking for?” She assumed her usual brisk, efficient manner.

“Marlene Toa. I want to know who she is.”

The librarian paused and looked at me for a moment, a slight frown creasing her brows. “Now, why do I find that familiar?” She thought for a moment, then a raised her eyebrows. “Oh, Marlene Toa. The missing woman.”

“The missing woman?” I echoed, anticipation rising. Somewhere in my mind, something clicked.

“Yes… I believe she went missing around…2 years ago, yes. I filed the newspaper articles and the missing persons poster somewhere here. Hold on, let me look it up.”

She typed into the computer for a while, frowned, then pulled up a huge folder from a drawer.

*I knew it,* I thought, *I knew the research would have to be old school.*

She flipped through the pages for a while, humming, squinting over her glasses, before her eyes lit up.

“There it is! All right, follow me, I’ll show you where the stuff is.” 

I walked along with her to a quiet little room in the library, where there were shelves of little folders, labelled with handwritten stickers.

She mumbled as she ran a finger along the folders, then pulled one out with a flourish.

“It should be in here somewhere,” she said. I thanked her, a bubble of admiration popping up, at her efficiency and work pride that had remained throughout all these years as a librarian.

Once alone, I flipped through the folder, until I got to what I needed. Her face leapt out at me from a copy of the missing poster that was put up all over town. I immediately recognised her. She as all over town for a couple weeks a few years back. I had just associated her face with the word, “missing”, and not her name. After all, her photograph was the main focus of those posters. Her name was probably lost in the description. I had never looked at one carefully, up close. In fact, I had taken extra care to not look at those posters.

And that was because of the guilt that I felt. Looking at her face now, the guilt that had niggled away at me two years back, came rushing back to the surface. And with what I knew about her using my body now, the guilt was intensely magnified.

No, I didn’t do anything to her. Just to make that clear. But that was the problem. I didn’t do anything.

I had seen her the day before she went missing. I had ventured out that night, disrupting my usual routine of library, park, and home. I work from home, and I like to head to the library just to have some differentiation between work and leisure hours. After which, I would head to the park, sit at a quiet corner and have my packed dinner. These days, I often skipped the library, though. It was getting pretty crowded, and that took away a lot of its charm. I often stay home nowadays and get my work done in a designated work area. I’m not someone who goes out much, and I’m not exactly social. I think in this town, probably 3 or 4 people would recognise me and say hi.

So that night, it had taken almost all of my energy and willpower to make myself take a step out of my comfort zone. I had listened to some podcast about how insanity was doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results, and been inspired to implement some change in my life. If I wanted more from life, I needed to do more, I told myself firmly. And that was how I found myself at the local bar, trying to work up the courage to speak to the rather imposing bartender, to order a drink. All the while repeating “Just one drink and I can go,” in my head like a mantra.

As I gathered my courage and tried to signal to get the bartender’s attention, a booming voice sounded next to me.

“A beer for this lady, kind sir!” The bartender immediately turned around, stared at the speaker, then at me, and nodded.

I looked at the source of the booming voice that commanded attention so easily. It was a man who seemed to be in his mid-forties, with grizzled face half cloaked in a massive beard and moustache combination. He had on a jolly demeanour, but something felt a little off about him. His eyes glinted with just a little too much energy, bordering on mania. He stared straight at me, a huge smile on his face, but one that did nothing to alleviate the unstable energy in his eyes.

I wanted to thank him, but at the same time, I was struggling with a whole host of emotions. Firstly, there was gratitude at anyone bothering to want to help me order a drink. But at the same time, I also felt annoyance, fear and a sense of dread. Annoyance, because I had not wanted a beer. I had wanted a gin and tonic, and I was rather put off by his presumptuous order. Fear and dread, because I didn’t know what it meant to have him call out for a beer for me. Was he buying me a drink? Do I assume that? Do I insist on paying him? Do I pretend that I was sure he was only ordering it for me, that I would be paying for it? If he was insisting on buying me a drink, what did he expect from me in return? Would I have to be nice to him, friendly, trade life stories? Would I be able to just down the drink and leave? Did I have to make friends? Do I buy him another drink back?

I’m guessing I don’t have to say it, but I shall, anyway. Yes, I’m an overthinker. And I’m easily anxious. It really explains why I don’t get out much, yea?

With all these thoughts and emotions whirling through my head, I just stared at him, unable to form a sentence.

“You’re welcome,” he said, bursting into a bellowing laughter that smacked me in the soul. It was the type of boisterous energy that I often admired in others, yet when faced with it in close quarters, I would often feel almost physically repelled by it.

I forced a smile, and before I could speak, he gestured to a table nearby. “There’s my boys,” he said, pointing out two young men, who smiled and stared at me, their expressions unreadable.

“You’re joining us! You young people can hang out,” he announced confidently.

I felt my heart drop to the floor. This was not at all what I was prepared for. I could feel my face turning pale, as cold sweat began to form on my forehead and my palms.  The bartender placed a pint of beer in front of me just then. I wanted to think of an excuse to leave, but my brain was blanking.

“I’ll have this beer!” A lady settled herself down next to me and grabbed the beer. She seemed a little older than I was, and she radiated an inspiring mix of bubbliness, confidence and toughness.

“Hey, get this lady whatever drink she wants, on my tab!” She yelled to the bartender. Then she turned to me and smiled. “Thanks for the beer!”

“All right now. That beer wasn’t for you.” The man said, stepping forward a step.

The lady, whom I now know to be named Marlene, stood up and faced him square on. “Oh dear. How about I join you and your boys instead? I can be a hoot,” she said. The words were friendly enough, but she managed to make it sound like a threat.

I hovered nearby, unsure what to do, anxiety crawling up my throat.

So I was incredibly relieved when she turned back to me, and said, loudly enough for the man to hear, “You don’t seem to want to be here. Don’t worry, if you want to, you can leave now, I can handle this.”

I stared at her with gratitude, smiled shakily and nodded. Then high-tailed it out of the bar.

That was the first and last time I had ever seen Marlene.

A few days later, the missing posters were everywhere. I had felt a terrible sense of dread, which I quickly squashed and blocked out. I had already tended to avoid watching the news on TV or reading the newspapers, as I was of the view that the world is already difficult and tough enough as it is, without having the horrible events in the world shoved right in my face. But after seeing the missing posters and recognising the lady from that night on them, I made it a point to avoid coming into contact with news of any kind. A part of me was terrified at the thought that perhaps she had gotten into trouble because of me. The rest of my mind had beat that thought into submission and shoved it in a locker.

I couldn’t help but keep thinking that perhaps I should report the incident to the police. That thought haunted me for about two days, before I overheard someone at the library talking about the missing woman and saying that she had most likely left town to avoid paying the rent on her place, which had apparently piled up over the past months. “She was also in debt,” that someone had whispered in a salacious tone, “to a few people in town.”

I remember a surge of relief washing over me then. She hadn’t been harmed, she had likely left town. Maybe that was why she had been so daring and straightforward with those men. She knew she would be leaving anyway.

And that was all the thought I had put into Marlene Toa. I felt ashamed, now, looking at her picture. I hadn’t even bothered to learn her name.

Here she was, using my body during my sleep. Doing things to these people. She had obviously met with a terrible fate, somehow. Yet I had chosen to cling onto the rumours that she had left town to avoid her debts. Just so I could feel better about not speaking out. So that I could not feel guilt about her standing up for me, and me just leaving the bar without a word.

That guy in the woods. I strove to remember the faces of the two young men at the bar. The sons of that man who had bought a beer for me. Was the trapped guy one of them?

I couldn’t, for the life of me, picture the faces of the young men. It was one incident, two years or so ago. Something I had put out of my mind for a long time.

I checked the time at this point. It was almost 6pm at this point. I could feel the stress of the day’s events weighing on me, draining my mind and body.

I left the library and headed to a nearby café to get a triple shot espresso. Once the caffeine was in my system, I grabbed a pen from my bag and began scribbling on the serviette.

*Marlene Toa,* I wrote, and underlined at the top of the serviette.

Beneath, I wrote down, in point form, *Missing* and *Likely dead.* Then, looking around to make sure no one was looking in my direction, I wrote, *Possessing my body while I sleep* and *Killed two people, trapped one.* Thinking for a bit, I added, *Maybe the three taken are the same father and sons I saw in the bar.* After all, the young man had said that she had killed his dad and brother.

The most likely story I could think of was that Marlene had been killed by the father and sons at the bar. She was probably using my body to hunt them down, as vengeance. But why me? Maybe I was supposed to die that day. Maybe I had been the intended victim, and her stepping in had caused her to die in my place.

She must hate me. Dear god, maybe she had taken my body to kill them, to frame me for murder. Two birds, one stone. She gets the guys who killed her, and frames the one who let her die in her stead.

I let her die in my stead. I got her killed. And I never even went to the police. I just told myself a convenient story and forgot all about her. It was karma. This was my karma.

I sat back and closed my eyes, feeling hot tears prickle behind my lids. *Do not cry in public,* I thought. *Don’t lose it.* I surreptitiously wiped the tears that trickled out, disguising it by yawning and rubbing my eyes. I stared at the words on the serviette. That story made sense. But now that I knew, what the hell was I supposed to do?

Perhaps I should just let her do what she wants with my body. Get her revenge. On them, on me. Then let her go in peace. As I face the music for my part in her death.

But a part of me railed against that thought. The same part of me that has repeatedly refused to give up on me, to just let things me. A spark that refused to die.

Maybe the story was all wrong. I couldn’t be sure. For all I knew, that incident at the bar and the father and his sons had nothing to do with Marlene going missing. I had to know for sure, before I decided on anything.

I had to go to the bar. It was a long shot, but perhaps the bartender was the same guy, perhaps he knew something.

It was near 8pm by the time I had settled down at the bar counter and chugged a gin and tonic to fuel my courage to talk to the bartender, who thankfully, was the same one I remembered from that night so long ago.

“Do you know Marlene?” I asked, out of the blue and without any preamble. I winced internally. Not the best start.

The bartender stared at me, a look of surprise and recognition on his face.

“Yea, why?” He asked, voice gruff, suspicious.

“I don’t know if you remember this, but around two years ago, I was here. Someone had bought me a beer. Marlene had helped me out. I was uncomfortable, she grabbed the beer instead and asked me to leave.” I wasn’t putting across the story as well as I could have. I got frustrated with myself. What the hell was wrong with me, that I couldn’t explain a simple scenario?

He frowned. “Two years is a long time. But yes. I remember that incident.” He looked at me, his face now inked with curiosity. “You’re that girl. Yes. I haven’t seen you around since.”

“Do you remember the man who bought the beer? And his two sons?” I asked. His frown deepened.

“Why? What’s it matter?” He seemed wary again.

“I need to know who they are,” I said, looking at him pleadingly. He stayed silent.

“I think they…I think Marlene is…I think…” I stuttered, and in my anxiety and mess of a mental state, I began to tear again. *Shit,* I thought. *Crybaby. Get it together,*  I admonished myself.

He took one look at my face, and his countenance softened. “Hey, you okay?” He grabbed some serviettes from behind the bar and passed them to me. I felt my face flush, and I looked down, not daring to face any of the judgemental stares that I was sure I was attracting.

“I just need to know who they are. I think they hurt Marlene,” I forced out, in as soft a voice I could muster, so that no one else would hear.

The bartender looked taken aback. “Hey, you can’t go around saying things like that,” he began.

“Please, I think she died because of me. Because she helped me,” I interrupted him. The tears continued. I no longer bothered to wipe them, the wiping was probably attracting more attention than the tears themselves.

“Oh shit, lady. No. That’s what you think?” He looked at me, then gestured for me to head out with him. He called for someone in the bar to take over for him for a bit.

I looked resolutely at the ground as we walked toward the exit, hoping desperately that no one was looking at me. We stepped out into the cold air, and he took out a cigarette. I turned down the cigarette he offered me.

“What happened with Marlene, no one knows,” he said, lighting up his cigarette. “To be honest, when she went missing soon after that incident, I had my doubts about the Tobers too. That guy and his sons.”

I stared at him, hanging onto each word.

“The whole thing really made an impression. After you left that night, Marlene sat down at their table, and the two young Tobers seemed really uncomfortable. Their dad was pissed. I wanted to tell Marlene to leave it, that she had made her point, but I didn’t have to. She seemed to think the same and returned to her table. But then the Tobers kicked up a fuss, said they weren’t paying for her beer. Marlene made some point about them having bought the beer for you, and you having let her have it, something like that. Anyway, words were exchanged. I just put the beer on the house to avoid any more shit going down.”

He took a long drag on his cigarette, then continued. “The Tobers seem like odd folks, but I figured they’re harmless. I told the police about the incident though, seemed weird that Marlene would disappear so soon after that. But don’t tell anyone that,” he said.

“The police questioned and cleared them, from what I know. So don’t hold it against yourself.” He looked sincere in his concern. I felt a rush of shame well up. He had gone to the police. As just a bystander, an observer, he had gone to the police with that information. But I hadn’t. I had chickened out and lied to myself to avoid doing the right thing. At the same time, I felt relieved. He had told the police. This meant that my report wasn’t needed. The situation had been made known to the police. And they had cleared the Tobers.

I stared into space for a while, trying to cope with the rush of emotions. He stood awkwardly before me, finishing his cigarette. We were silent for the next few minutes. Then he patted my arm awkwardly, and headed back into the bar.

I got home and continued to just sit there, digesting everything that I had learnt. The gin and tonic turned out to be a bad idea. Combined with the crazy array of emotions that had gone through me, it brought on a heavy sense of weariness that I was afraid I would not be able to combat for long.

Finally, I began composing a letter.

As I wrote *Dear Marlene,* I got curious. Why was the note she wrote to me in my handwriting? I got worried. Was this all a story in my head, and I had actually sleepwalked myself into murder charges? I pushed that thought from my mind. Maybe it was muscle memory. After all, she was using hands that had been writing in a certain way for so many years. I continued writing.

*I think I know what happened. You were killed by the Tobers, weren’t you? And I just stood by, doing nothing. Not reporting the whole incident with them and you in the bar. I’m so sorry. I thought you left town on your own. There was talk about you leaving to escape debt. I think I wanted to believe that, more than anything else. I didn’t want to feel guilty. But now I know. You were killed by the Tobers, probably for rescuing me. Maybe I was supposed to die instead. I get why you want revenge on them and me. Why you chose my body. I get it. I wish I did more, I wish I stayed, I wish I reported it.*

I began to cry again at this point, a tear or two wetting the paper and smudging a letter or two. I ignored it. It was legible still.

*I don’t want to be a murderer. I don’t want to have my life ruined like this. I’m selfish I know. I’m sorry. But please, could you not kill him? Could we let things be? I swear to you I’ll try to make things up somehow. Maybe I’ll help other women. I’ll stand up for others. I’ll do charity. I’ll help out any family or friends you want me to. Please. Just let me have my life back. Please I’m sorry.*

I stopped writing then, and just curled up as my body was wracked with sobs.

I wept for a long time, and then exhaustion overcame me. I slept.

When I woke up, my entire body ached. My back felt like it was on fire whenever I moved. My fingers were covered with dirt and blood. Was it mine? Was it someone else’s? Dread bloomed in my heart. I looked over at the table. The letter I had written was still there. There was no response, no note left behind. I felt my heart plunge. She hadn’t accepted my apologies. She didn’t change her mind. I stared at the abrasions and cuts on my hands, and wondered what these hands had done last night.

There was a fierce burning in my arms too, whenever I reached out to grab something or to support myself. I felt almost petrified with terror. What did she do? 

I grabbed a carton of milk from the fridge and some slices of cheese. I put them in my backpack and left the house, not bothering to shower or change. I didn’t care anymore.

I was about to head off the road to go back into the woods when I just stopped moving. I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t face whatever it was that had happened last night. I couldn’t deal with this mess, this insanity anymore. I couldn’t do it. I sat down by the side of the road, and ignored a car that went by, honking at me and a passenger asking if I was all right. I must have just sat there for a good ten minutes, my mind and body shut down. Then I slowly got to my feet. I wouldn’t have to deal with this anymore. Not alone. No. I would face whatever I had to face, but this was no longer going to be my secret horror.

I walked on the road, away from the woods. I kept on walking, until I found myself in front of the police station. I walked right in, and sat down in front of an officer, who looked alarmed at the state I was in. I must have been a sight, with soil all over my body and clothes, hair messed up, dried blood on my hands, and scratches everywhere. I tried to answer his questions, tried to speak, but it felt like someone had stuffed cotton down my throat. I couldn’t force the words out. The more I panicked, the denser the cotton in my throat got. In the end, I just sat there, tearing, unable to speak. I finally grabbed the sleeve of the police officer, and stood up to lead him out. Looking bewildered, he followed me, gesturing for a colleague to go with us.

I just walked, ignoring their incessant questions, the looks of bemusement on the faces of passers-by, and the cold wind which seemed to blow right through my bones. I had forgotten to wear a coat, I realised somewhere in my befuddled mind. I kept walking, until we got to the spot in the woods, after I had tracked down the red paint marks. They were much easier to spot the second time around. The officers with me were beginning to look worried and alarmed. One of them drew his weapon and kept it by his side, at the ready. I found the clearing.

I knelt down, and began to dig with my hands, having forgotten the shovel. The police officers stood back, then one of them knelt down to help me. He found a rock and used it to dig as well. They had stopped asking questions by then. They must have figured I wouldn’t answer no matter what they asked, how they asked. The other officer stood on guard and alert. I kept digging. And digging. But there was nothing. No trapdoor to be found. Had I gone insane? Did I dream up the whole thing?

Before relief could spring forth, my hand hit a hard surface. Ah, there it was. I swiped around it, and soon realised that it was the wall. The wall of the hidden space beneath. I kept digging, and soon hit the rungs of the ladder. The entire space had been filled in, I realised. Covered over, buried with soil. The last Tober guy. He must be…gone.

The officers looked alarmed by then. They called someone, and soon, more people came, with proper shovels and digging equipment. I just sat at the side, watching, still unable to speak, unable to respond to anything the officers said. A heavy dread squeezed my insides. I felt like I could barely breathe.

In a matter of an hour or so, they had uncovered the entire small space within, the part once covered by the trapdoor, which had mysteriously disappeared.

Nothing was there. They found not a single scrap of clothing, no chains, no ties, no bones, no blood, nothing.

They kept questioning me, even after they had brought me back to the station. A doctor came to check me out. Still, I was unable to say a word. Finally, someone offered me a pen and a notepad.

*I sleepwalked here. I woke up, and I think I remembered something bad happening here. I don’t know, maybe it was a dream,* I wrote.

Loud chatter ensued, as the officers discussed what I had written. They asked lots of questions, like how I had known of the little crawlspace in the woods, what I saw, what bad thing happened, but I kept quiet. In the end, I repeatedly wrote, *I think it was just a bad dream. I don’t know how I ended up there.*

With just that, the officers had to let me go. They seemed to be beginning to think it was some sort of weird sleepwalking incident, that perhaps I had known of that space as a kid and forgotten about it. They made up all sorts of explanations, I’m sure.

When I got home, I finally noticed a new video on my mobile phone. I clicked on it, and my face appeared.

The me in the video was seated in the familiar hunched position I tended to fall into whenever seated, then she straightened up.

“Hey. Marlene here. I’m guessing you know all about what happened,” she said, in my voice but in a different prosody. She adjusted her position again.

“Wow, you really hunch a lot, huh. You should sit up straight more,” she said, sounding like a concerned older sister.

“You got the most part right,” she said, and began drumming her fingers on the table. She caught herself and stopped, flattening her hands on the table. “Your body keeps falling back into its own rhythms and habits.”

*That explains the handwriting,* I thought to myself, absent-mindedly.

“The Tobers killed me,” she said, her lips, my lips, pulling back, forming a thin line.

“They were up to no good. I sensed it the moment that man approached you. That’s why I stepped in.” Her eyes darkened, and a look of pure hatred flashed in her gaze.

“They got to me that night, as I was almost home. The bastards got me.” She seemed to be overflowing with rage and disdain. Then she pulled herself together.

“I won’t talk about what they did. But yes, they killed me. But what you got wrong, young lady, was the part about you.” Here, she adjusted the phone’s camera and looked straight into it. 

“I’m not using your body for revenge. I don’t hate you. What am I, stupid? Why would I blame the other almost-victim for these barbaric fuckers’ actions?”

I looked at the sincerity on her face, on my face, and felt a wave of disbelief. She didn’t blame me? How could she not?

“They wanted to hurt you, I knew. And then they hurt me. That is not on you. You know why I went after them, used your body to do so, after all this time?” Here, she scowled, a glower in her eyes.

“I was around them for a long time. I couldn’t seem to move on. But I couldn’t seem to do anything to them, either. Until one day, they began to track you again.”

“I was there, and I watched as they regained their interest in you. They remembered you from that night. They were watching you at the library, watching you go to the park for your dinners, watching you go home in the evening. They were watching you, writing down your schedule. And I knew they were going to do something to you too. You didn’t even notice. Seriously, lady, get some wits about you. Look around once in a while. You were ridiculously easy to follow.”

I felt a cold fluid sensation settled in the pit of my stomach. They were following me? I didn’t get an inkling of that. Fear seeped in around my neck and I looked around my room, suddenly paranoid.

“They had followed you home last week, and I finally had enough. I tried to reach you, I tried to wake you, call to you, but you couldn’t hear me. I was desperate, so I grabbed you, tried to reach you in your dreams or something. That was when I took over. When I realised I was you. I was controlling your body.”

My mouth hung open, and I felt my mind raise a white flag at this point. I just couldn’t think anymore, couldn’t try to make sense of anything. All my mind could do was to passively register what was going on. No more reasoning. It was done.

“I knew I had to stop them. I knew about that trapdoor and the space there. I found it when I was a kid. I figured it was someone’s long forgotten bomb shelter or secret drug hiding place or something. Anyway, it seemed completely unused for years, and no one ever came near that area. So I treated it as my secret hangout spot for a while, made those markings on the trees. Until I got older and…okay I digress.”

“I waited until they left, then I went to find that place, using your body. I cleared the earth off the trapdoor and tried to lift the lid. It took a while, after those years untouched. I got banged up pretty badly, sorry about that. The next night, I came and took over your body again. They had followed you home again, and were just watching. It was easy enough to lure them there. I just left your house when they were still outside, and headed right there at a run. They came after me, not very stealthily at that. They didn’t even bother keeping a proper distance. They must have thought they had struck the lottery, with me running into the desolate woods of my own accord. They followed.”

I was enraptured by this point, and had to remind myself to breathe.

“Anyway, they lost track of me for a bit in the woods,  I got there first, lifted the lid, made it look like I had gone inside, then hid closeby. Once they had gone in, I ran out and shut the trapdoor on them.”

Here, she smiled, a cold, cruel smile. “You don’t have to know the rest.”

She leant back and seemed to relax. “Now, all you need to know, is that you’re safe. None of the Tobers will be bothering you anymore. Or anyone else, for that matter. And don’t worry, you’re not going to be in trouble. I hid everything. Got rid of everything,” she said, in a tone full of meaning.

She stared into the camera for a few moments longer, then smiled, a sudden softness in her expression. “I’m going off now. Your body’s been through a lot. I probably strained it beyond what it would normally be able to do. Think you should just sleep it out for a while. Take care, Jodie. It was nice…meeting you.”

Here, she reached forward toward the screen and the video ended.

I sat in silence for a long time, letting myself absorb the full weight of what she had said. A deep undercurrent of gratitude swept over me. Marlene Toa. I wouldn’t forget her.

I lay back down on my bed, and shut my eyes. And got the first proper sleep I had had in days[.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDarkSeas/)

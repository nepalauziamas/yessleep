I went to my mother’s house for dinner. Leaving town was probably a better idea, because I wasn’t going to be able to save anyone anyway. I know that now.

Showing up wasn’t my original plan. Not after yesterday morning. But the longer I sat at that JavaStop wasting gas and trying to talk myself into doing *something, anything*, the harder it was to see the incident with J. Fairweather (round two, I guess) as a forerunner, or, god forbid, some sort of demonic manifestation of the monster I’d imagined my brother to be (I told you all, ghosts aren’t real. Demons wouldn’t be either). I think I’ve presented myself as a pretty logical person— you have to be when you know and see what I do. But logic isn’t foolproof. The longer I sat and thought about Fairweather and the call I took on a Nokia that disappeared along with him, and then the text messages punctuating the silences between Jamie’s calls (*maybe those were the first times Max had reached out to me at all and he was worried that I’d ghosted him*) the more I realized that I must have scared myself into hallucinating. I thought, okay, maybe posting my experiences onto a scary story forum wasn’t the most effective way of attempting to make sense of an admittedly bizarre few months and keep my cool.

So, I talked myself into reaching backward and picking up my cellphone. First step to getting better is admitting you lost your marbles in the first place. The first clue that I was overreacting, and maybe seeing things—stress can do that to a person, I’m sure— was that the texts I’d told you all about yesterday weren’t there. Just like the Nokia. Just like J. Fairweather. Okay. Definite overreaction. I couldn’t tell if I felt relief or intense concern for my mental wellbeing.

*(Except, I probably should have remembered that sometimes people dream when they’re awake because the universe doesn’t have time to wait for lights out to send you the warning you need.)*

Step two: I called my mother. Calling Jamie back first meant getting yelled at—no one needs that kind of energy when they’re already walking on thin ice. The food poisoning excuse came in handy here, because when mummy dearest found out I was feeling sick and didn’t really want to explain to Jamie that I was shitting my guts out in a hospital bathroom stall, she *immediately* forgave my absence. A mother could never scold a sick child (even if that child was almost thirty)

“Don’t you worry at all, Baby,” she crooned. I imagined she was talking to me with the house phone tucked between her chin and her shoulder, making hors d’oeuvres and gesturing wildly to Jamie to go grab her a roll of tin foil. “Alexis volunteered to bring Max home, anyway. You rest as long as you need.”

“But,” she said, (there’s always a but—Mum guilt activate) “Max would really like to see you. He’s been asking about you over the phone. You two used to be so close; I think he thinks he’s burned a bridge with you and it worries him.”

I locked myself into a very bad situation with what I said next. Turns out people pleasing is a skill that doesn’t turn off when your “I’m in danger” meter is screaming at you.

“I’ll be there, Mum,” I said. “I just need to rest awhile.”

“Downstairs bathroom is all yours, when you’re ready” she laughed.

Come to think of it, I *was* feeling sick to my stomach.

\*\*\*

The compromise I made with myself was that if I *had* to go—and at the time I’d figured that facing my fear (*of a vision of a man who’d died over 20 years ago and your brother’s walking carcass*) was the best way to feel stable again— I’d go late. No one would question that anyway, especially because my mother would be telling anyone she spoke to for the next week and a half that I’d gotten food poisoning from a grocery store cinnamon roll and spent a whole day “making pudding.” If it turned out that I had indeed been scared for nothing, the worst thing I’d have to deal with would be the poop jokes. I could handle that.

I went back to my apartment, then, and slept. I didn’t dream about anything. Clue number two (wrong) that I was probably going to need to call a doctor about stress leave once I made it through dinner.

Dinner started at 5:30 last night; we never ate that early but Mum was trying to keep Max’s body on the schedule that it had been on at the inpatient facility, said that it would be helpful to him on his first days of recovery without medical structure. That meant that I could probably get away with showing up at seven. I woke up from my nap around four, waited an hour to text Jamie that I was going to be late— *Just waiting on the pepto to kick in, sry again about this morning, see you around 7 probs. Love you.*— and then I just sat and stared at the wall. I didn’t have the energy to do anything else.

Jamie replied to my message with a photo of Max—his *shell*— and Alexis laughing with their arms around each other’s shoulders. *Looks like the drive went well. They’re besties, lol,* she said.

The back of my neck tingled. I ignored it because it was really good to see Max smiling. He was the only one in the family that got our grandmother’s red hair, and it was curly and fell onto his forehead in a way that made him look five years younger. It was that smile that brought me to my mother’s house in the end, and a memory of us in senior year cutting fifth period to smoke in the park across the street, the last time I’d seen him laugh like that, with his curls in his eyes and the darkness I’d watched him swallow for a decade miles and miles away. Truth is, I ached for my brother. Still do. So I showed up earlier than I planned.

I walked through the front door about twenty to seven, deliberately refused to look into the den—*the last place Max was for real. The last time you’d ever really see him*— and followed the sound of bright chatter into the dining room. The four of them were all sitting at the same end of the table, opposite the entrance I wandered into. Alexis noticed me first, gave a polite smile and then tapped Jamie on the shoulder to shift her attention.

“Well look who’s off the toilet,” Jamie teased. Max, who was sitting beside Mum now, laughed the loudest. It sounded just like it did when we were younger, before he’d gotten lost.

Then he stood, and without saying a word walked around the table to where I hung back in the doorway, and held out his arms.

“I missed you, sissy,” he said.

I cried then—couldn’t help it— and stepped into a hug I hadn’t realized I’d been desperate for. Max and I weren’t twins, but we were close enough in age that we acted like it. Losing him felt like losing a physical part of me, and for a split second, I’d fully convinced myself that it didn’t matter if this wasn’t the *old* Max. This new Max laughed and smiled and didn’t look like he was in pain. It was okay to treat him like he was my brother. I needed my brother.

Except Max wasn’t giving off any heat.

In fact, he was ice cold. In the middle of a heatwave in July and I could feel how cool he was to the touch through his clothing.

I stepped back abruptly, and then in a desperate attempt to hide my shock, I shot him a wan smile. I think I added a quick “okay, enough sentimental shit, what am I missing,” to sell it, and moved to sit next to Alexis. Max went back to his place, now directly across from me.

That tingle in my neck I ignored earlier? It was travelling up and down my spine now.

Don’t ask me what we talked about after that; I don’t remember. I don’t remember how long we sat there. I don’t remember anything between the hug and when Alexis’ phone rang in her pocket. The tone, a robotic high-pitched beeping, caught Mum in the middle of a rant about the new Pyrex baking dishes.

“Shit— my bad!” Alexis began frantically patting all of her pockets. “I went analog last week as part of a smartphone detox experiment and I haven’t figured out how to turn the goddamned ringer off— op! There it is!”

I had to stifle a shriek when I saw what she pulled out from under the table. It was an old Nokia brick phone—one you had to flip open to answer. One just like the phone I’d thought I’d heard Max on that morning. Alexis flicked it open with her thumb and slammed it closed again on her lap, choking the sound. She glanced up at us sheepishly. “I’ll get used to it one of these days, I’m sure. It’s been really great to unplug, if I’m honest.”

*Just a coincidence,* I thought. *A coincidence.*

(*A* *warning*)

I could’ve vomited.

*( cold he was so cold so dead so very dead)*

“—Shelby, remember?” Mum’s voice brought me back to the table.

“What?”

“We’re telling Alexis about how we found out you had the *sight.”*

“Excuse me?”

Jamie snorted into her drink. “It’s okay Shelb, she knows. Max was telling her all of the family secrets on the drive.”

“Jesus, Jaim, don’t tell her that she’s going to kill me,” Max cried, stifling a giggle. “Sissy, I didn’t just blurt it out, there was context—“

“I *needed* context, Shelby, Max was telling me about all of the crazy shit that used to happen here, and he just *casually* starts going on about a guy getting his brains blown out by a carnival ride malfunction and *you were stuck next to him until they turned it off*? I was like what the fuck man you can’t just drop that shit on me without the story first!”

No.

Alexis continued. “And then he tells me that you *knew it was coming* and I pried the rest out of him!”

*No no no no no no no.*

I hadn’t seen Fairweather that morning. I’d seen a vision.

And I’d talked myself into ignoring it.

“How did you know that I dreamed Fairweather’s death?” I wanted the question to come out demanding, but I couldn’t speak much louder than a whisper.

“We all know, Baby,” said my mother.

“We’ve known the whole time,” said Jamie.

“We know everything,” said Max.

“I—I never told you that I saw.”

Mum began to laugh, shrill and cutting. Jamie and Alexis joined in.

“You’ve never been good at letting the rest of us know about impending doom, sissy.” Max was the only one not laughing. He locked his gaze on me, and for the first time that night I saw how empty it was. “It’s not very nice of you, keeping all of that to yourself.”

I wanted to run, wanted to yell for help, but I couldn’t even get a breath in. Mum, Jamie and Alexis were still laughing. Tears spurted from their eyes as they wheezed, pounded their fists on the tabletop, held onto the backs of their chairs for support.And then Max grabbed Jamie by the hair on the back of her head and slammed her face into her dinner plate, shattering Mum’s wedding china into a dozen pieces. Jamie went quiet then. Max held onto her. Mum and Alexis didn’t seem to notice. They were still cackling.

“What did you *do,”* I whispered.

Max let go of Jamie’s head and clapped. In unison, both Alexis and my mother leaned forward and joined Jamie—gently, this time—burying their faces in their leftovers. I watched in horror as he pointed down toward where he’d grabbed a clump of Jamie’s hair. With the back of her head now exposed, I saw it. The gaping hole where her skull should have been. The blood staining her neck and the back of her shirt.

And then Max’s hands, stained crimson.

Max pointed at Mum, and then at Alexis. Each had a matching crater, bits of skin caught in their sticky, matted hair.

Jamie sat up first. Her nose had broken, scrunched flat against her face at an unnatural angle. “Fuck, Max, where’s your table manners?” She sounded almost bored.

Mum was up next, “Honey, we just got you back, please don’t start the antics now!”

Alexis followed, wiping a glob of mashed potato off of her eyebrow with a disinterested finger and putting it into her mouth.

My legs came unglued then, and I scrambled out of my chair, out of the house, out of town.

I didn’t scream until I found a place to stay for the night. And then I couldn’t stop. Not for a very long time.

\*\*\*

As sure as you and me and the universe is made of protons and neutrons, my family is gone. I didn’t have to see anyone float above the rafters this time to confirm.

There’s a part of me that wishes I hadn’t gone late, but the other part of me that knows better understands that I’d be laughing at that table with them now had I been on time.

I don’t know what’s going on. I don’t know if what happened to Max, to my mother and my sister and her partner, is going to happen again in other places. I don’t know what I’m going to do with me from here on out. I don’t know if they’ll follow.

But if any of you read my story, and take me seriously, remember this:

There is no such thing as ghosts.

But there are such things as warnings.

If you’re lucky enough to get them from time to time, listen. One of them may be your last chance.

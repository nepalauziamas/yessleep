Y'all can laugh , make fun , call bullshit but I have a feeling for all this . I might be wrong but please give some time to get in my place and understand the situation . 


My friend which will remain anonymous is 25M a really tall fella , a bit over 2 meters in height and fat , really fat , around 210kg fat  not just obese he used to wrestle professionally for a long time until be got a knee injury but that's irrelevant the matter is that , He vanished mysteriously today . He doesn't drive and he never goes out of town so he can't have crashed somewhere or get stuck in any weird place . He has always been a really chill dude who had it good with literally everyone around him he never had a single enemy in his life . Now to the main story .


His favorite hobby is to make up stories since he was really young , maybe around 15 and thought out the years he has been really good at it , then he makes fake profiles on every type of media and upload the stories . I bet that many of you have seen some . All of the stories are abt sightings of creatures , paranormal activity , conspiracy theories and things of this nature. He is pretty talented imo he could clearly be a writer . He tells me his scenarios so we can make them as realistic as possible together , avoid mistakes , and keep a good timeline aka to make it look real  .His very last one was abt a person who had seen some atrocities by a group of mysterious people who have control over entire cities , he mentioned a HQ location , how they look , what they do to get money like human  trafficking etc he even added random names . He ended by saying that he has enough proof to get it to them via police and such shit   generally an entertaining story to read I don't know where he posted it but it has been on for over a week of it being uploaded  . The main issue , Hours ago this house was raided and he is no where to be seen . No trace of anyone forcing himself in or out of the house . Y'all can laugh at me but I believe that  by chance he actually explained a true group of people and their actions,  they must have found the post and tracked him down   . For those who say that it is a coinsidence let me say . I live in a shit hole of an area and gangs are everywhere and these types of stories have been around for a long time already  also , No one on this planet can move this man if he doesn't want to . He is reported for missing and now we can't do more than wait .

I will update you as soon as they check camera footage of the area around him house

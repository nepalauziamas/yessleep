Let me start off by saying that my wife doesn’t believe in paranormal entities or anything of that nature. We have three cats, and one of them likes to be a rebel, jumping onto counters and meowing at the top of his lungs just looking for attention. He does this throughout the night and it’s a regular occurrence. 

Last night, after a few beers and video games, i decided it was time to head to bed with my wife. When I woke up this morning, my wife was basically attached to me with wide eyes and a nervous look on her face. I asked her what was wrong and she proceeded to tell me what happened last night. 

She said that around 2:50 in the morning, she was woken up to a noise that sounded like one of our cats downstairs meowing unusually loud. After giving herself a few seconds to perk up and fully pay attention, she said that the “meows” sounded more like a person trying to mimic a cat and it kept saying “hello”. 

After “meowing” for two to three minutes, a loud bang came at our door and then a notification went off for a motion sensor at our front door. When she told me this, I checked my phone and sure enough, there was a notification for motion detected at 2:52 AM. I asked her why she didn’t wake me up so I could grab my gun, she said she was frozen with fear and didn’t want “it” to hear her make a noise. 

We’re out running errands while I’m typing this, but something made me uncomfortable about her story. Last night I set the home security alarm around 9 PM, and we didn’t turn it off till we walked the dog this morning. To make things worse, we had slept with with all of the animals in the room and the door was closed. So whatever was in our house or outside the front door was not one of our animals. Obviously the first thing that came to my mind was a skinwalker, but maybe I’m just being paranoid. 

I checked all the rooms in the house after I got up, I’m not sure what I could’ve done anyways. It’s very odd that my wife was scared so badly by something she doesn’t necessarily believe in. We bought this house brand new, so no one has lived here before. When I’m home alone, I do feel like I’m being watched or someone’s always walking directly behind me. My wife also said that the house has given her chills since we moved in. Something is just “off” about it. 

We just got home and I went to hang up one of my shirts in the master bedroom closet when I noticed that the board that covers the attic access has been shifted a little. When I asked my wife about it, she said she’s never been up there and the builders would’ve placed it back in it’s original place before we made the purchase. I’m genuinely getting anxious just thinking about what could be going on. Has anyone had an experience like this? Or similar at least? We’re going to my mother in law’s to get some sage. My wife said burning it should keep whatever’s around our house away.

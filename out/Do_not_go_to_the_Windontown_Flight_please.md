Hello, my name is Malik. I am a 23 year old male, and me and my friend named George are a survivor of the Windontown Flight.

Upon entering the airport, I said goodbye to my girlfriend and we kissed. I went up to George, and we high fived. After, we went up to the flight attendant and she handed us a strange sheet of brown, ripped paper. 

I asked her,
“Excuse me, what is this paper for?”

and she said,

“Don’t ask questions. If you want to make it out alive just follow the rules.”

I shivered. The sound of her voice was lifeless and she wasn’t in a timely manner like seconds ago.

After a couple hours, our flight was ready. 
We were excited because it was our first flight ever.

Upon entering the plane, me and George sat in our seats and read the paper. It gave us 7 strict rules that shivered both of us to the bone.

“1. Do not talk to anyone that looks even the slightest off for the first 5 hours. They aren’t human, even though they look like it.”

“2. If you see a man with a white bag approach you, do not make eye contact for more than 3 seconds and move seats immediately.”

“3. Check your phone/watch on an hourly basis. If you forget, “it” will come for you.”

“4. If your tv screen displays an eyeball on the screen, look away immediately.”

“5. If you see anyone staring at you, ask them how their day was, regardless of the first rule.”

“6. On the 5th hour, you may start talking with others on the plane. If they come off in an aggressive manner, ignore them or it will go bad.”

“7. OD TON KOOL TA EHT TGHILF TNEDNETTA NO EHT NEVESHT RUOH. YEHT OD TON TSIXE.”

We were shook. While George tried deciphering the last rule, I was looking around and through the windows. It was fine at first sight. 

When the plane took off, me and George felt something was eerily off with this place. Everyone around us looked human, but they felt empty.

I’m talking about the feeling where you know something looks real, but it’s not the real thing.

That’s when one of them came up to us. It was a woman, but you can tell it wasn’t a human. The average size for a woman is about 5’4-5’8. But this “woman” was about 6’4. Her eyes were displaced, they were just above her nose, which isn’t right. Her hands were long and skinny, it was like she wasn’t even a living being at all.

“May I sit?” 

The sound of her voice still haunts my eardrums to this day.
It sounded like 2 women talking at once, but they weren’t women at all.

Me and George looked at each other, and then her. We looked back at each other and didn’t respond, listening to the first rule.

“I said, may I sit?”

This time it said it in a more aggressive manner. Soon after no response, it went and sat back down.

We checked our phones.

“Huh, Malik it’s 3:00 pm.” George said with a pause.

“There’s no way, it was just 1:45?”

That’s when the man with the white bag came up to us. 

“Hey, pals.” said the man with the white bag.

Me and George grabbed our bags, got up and switched seats immediately. 
The man with the white bag looked at us in rage, but we didn’t look at him for a second.

That’s when I looked at my tv, it showed an eyeball on my screen
“Dude, do you see that?”

“Malik, look away, remember the rules.”

George was right, I looked away as fast as I could, but when I did, I saw the entire flight about to turn their head, but they stopped when I looked away. George noticed this too.

“I think the eyeball was signaling them, you almost looked at it for a second too long.” George whispered.

“Yeah, i’m terrified, man.”

That’s when I looked up. I saw a man across from us on the left, staring at us.
Me and George said in unison, trying to be polite,

“Hello sir, how was your day?”

The man looked back at his computer slowly without saying a word.

That’s when we heard a thump coming from the bathroom. 

“Thump.”

“Thump.”

“Thump.”

I remembered, when the flight attendant gave us the list of rules I could hear her say,

“If either of you hear a thump coming from the bathroom, it’s one of two things.”

“You either broke a rule, or “it’s” getting tired of waiting.”

That’s when the bathroom door busted open. “It” was a tall and slender white entity. It looked much like a figure from the backrooms.

I told George what was happening, not trying to break eye contact with “it”.

It then came charging at us for a few seconds. Me and George started sprinting to the safety exit.

The passengers and flight attendants got up and tried to stop us from reaching the exit, but me and George fought our way through.

After dozens of punches and blows without thinking, we made it to the exit, but “it” was still walking towards us.

Me and George busted down the door and jumped without a thought.

As we were falling, we could see the plane and ourselves warping out of reality, then warping back in a few seconds later.

We were back in the plane. But this time me and George were ready to get out of here by force.

“I have two shanks in my bag.”

“Why do you have those?”

“Safety comes first, bro.”

George handed me one, we both agreed to do it.

After the passengers realized we were posing a threat, they got up and started mindlessly running at us.

We killed each and every one of them, and jumped out the plane again.

And again.

And again.

And again.

And for the final time, me and George decided there was no escaping, that’s when we warped back into the reality where we were falling out of the plane.

We were back on the plane, but this time it landed.
Everyone got up, and so did me and George.

When we walked out everyone was gone, nowhere to be seen, but we saw an airport in the distance.

After walking in, the flight attendants were shocked, mouths agape and everything.
They all applauded.

“You two passed the test.”

“Ready for Part 2?”

Me and George looked at each other, and then there we were. 

There was another brown sheet of paper in my hand, but this time, it was 5x longer.

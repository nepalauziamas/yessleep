My family and a few other families went to a big house for the weekend. It was a 5 hour ride to the house but it was really nice and had a lake and park nearby. We were sharing the house with 2 other families while the rest of the families went to a different house close to us. I don’t really talk to the other teens in the house I’m in that much mostly because they are girls and are 2-3 years younger than me but I don’t mind staying around them.

I slept upstairs on this balcony place where I could see the living room. The girls slept in a room separated from the balcony by a glass door with blinds to cover it.

I wasn’t getting bored as I brought my laptop and my phone with me. I couldn’t hear much though as the parents were playing loud music, talking to each-other while the girls and my younger brother were screaming occasionally.

But there was one thing bothering me while I relaxed on the couch where I slept. There were these 2 masks I could see through the gaps of the railing. They were thin, strangely big in height and had red and blue features. But the thing that gave me a weird feeling of insecurity was that the eyes and mouths were hollowed out while 1 mask had the expression of fear, fear as if they were facing something worse than death while the other was sad like death could be the best thing to happen to it. I tried facing the other way but that just made everything way worse because there was a window to the black outside, pitch black.

Somehow I fell asleep at like 1 am but woke again at 2 just to go to the toilet. The toilet was in the girls room which was kind of embarrassing for me to just enter in the middle of the night but it was either that or go downstairs quietly and walk past the dark corridor which I didn’t feel like doing so I just walked through their room to their toilet. Luckily they didn’t wake up. So as I was washing up there was a mirror, I looked at myself and suddenly remembered the 2 masks. The feeling of insecurity rose a lot but nothing happened. I exit the bathroom...

Something felt off

I walk quietly back to my couch through through the girls’ room. I closed the glass door with the blinds down. I then remember it wasn’t closed when I entered so I decide to open it but when I reached the handle the blinds went up violently and I got a glimpse of one of the girls... Their eyes were hollowed out. I try to scream but nothing came out, I ran backwards and found myself looking at the masks once again.

I wake up sweaty so I wipe my face with my blanket. It hurt a bit but zI’m sure it was nothing. I go check up on the girl’s face and I let out a sigh of relief. Crash. I hear something fall. I’m not sure why but I went to it instinctively with a speed I’m not used to. Everyone was leaving the house without me and had replaced the girl with a dummy. So the first thing I did was grab a knife and start stabbing. I couldn’t stop, I tried, I really tried but then everything was worse when I saw my little brother. I started to tear out my own eyes as I couldn’t live with the thought of killing my brother. The people who lived ran outside and went to the nearby town.

I cried as hard as possible, I had killed my parents and their friends but soon I wasn’t crying because of that but because of the burning feeling I felt when the tears touched my skin. I tried to wipe off the tears but I realised that it was red and fleshy. I didn’t have skin. Death could be better than this. But then something even worse happened, my brother started calling my name. I picked up the knife and the next thing I know is I’m walking with the same speed I wasn’t used to.

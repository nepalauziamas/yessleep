Hello everyone, I just want to say that I am not entirely sure that this is a Skinwalker since I live in Australia; but what we encountered seems close enough so that is why I described it as a Skinwalker.

Okay so it was the summer of 2015, my buddy whom I will call P and and his older yet still teenage cousin who happened to be staying at his place whom I will call L where hanging out at his place since we where on School break, we were both in high school and i don’t know if any of you know but Australia has Summer around the time as Christmas, so naturally being a few days near Christmas that was all we would talk about what we are doing and presents we got our family members. 

Eventually P’s Mum told us to leave to take the dogs for a walk, we thought that it was a bit strange since she usually only let us stay in the Backyard by his old treehouse and his pool, so that she could keep an eye on us; especially when P’s dad was away on business trips like it was on this day, but we did. For reference P has two dogs, a Male Golden Retriever and a Female Caucasian Shepherd. I will not say there names but both dogs have quite long hair and since the Australian sun is quite hot they had to cut there hair down so that it would small to survive the Australian Sun.

Also this I know most people don’t know what a Caucasian Shepherd Dog is, I’ll give you two links:

This inform is somewhat needed for later in the story. So anyway we begin to walk them and after a while since it was hot, L said that we should take a trail in the nearby bush so that we can get some shade. We all agreed and so we went into the Bush. For Reference the Bush is basically the Australian version of the Woods. Usually in the Summer you don’t go in the Bush due to snakes but we were young and wanted to get out of the sun and so we just went.

Anyway so about 10 Minutes of walking in the Bush both Dogs stop. The Golden Retriever starts to whimper and tries to run away and the Caucasian Shepherd stands her ground, simultaneously sniffing the air then growling. L thought that the Golden Retriever might have gotten bitten by a snake. Now like I said before both dog breeds usually have long enough hair to somewhat protect them from snake bites but since it was summer and there hair was short, this is a problem and they would need to be taken to a Vet immediately.

L quickly checked and couldn’t see anything. But as I looked around for Snakes wishing that we didn’t come here. I saw it. At first I thought it was either a Kangaroo or Large Dog, which was about 17 Meters which in USA mathematics is about 55 Feet and 9 Inches. It was acting odd as it had its back against a tree, arms crossed like a human and just watching us; Kangaroos usually just lay down if they are tired or something but this thing was upright laying on a Tree it is odd. So I yelled out to them “What is that Kangaroo doing?”

P and L looked over and saw it both said something on the lines to “That ain’t no Kangaroo, mate.”

They were right because it saw that we saw it and after looking at it I’d describe it as a tall Man-Kangaroo hybrid, arms like a man but with small claws on its fingers yet legs like a Kangaroo, an extremely like-brown coat, face was similar to that of a Kangaroo but also was a bit square shaped like a Mastiff Dog. It both simultaneously ran and hopped as it came towards us. I think that it only attacked because we all saw it as it didn’t look predatory when we spotted it, almost like it was minding its own business and when it saw us see it then it though we where a threat of something. We didn’t really have time to run only making it two steps before it was right in front of us. 

It lunged at me but just as it was knocking me to the ground his Caucasian Shepherd jumped up biting it’s arm, P fell forward and let go of the lead to let the Dog do what it had to do. Since a Caucasian Shepherd Dog can have a bite force up to 700 PSI (which for reference a Lion only has a Biteforce of 650 PSI) you know that this creature was truely in pain when it let out a yelling sound similar to that of a dogs whimper of pain, as the Caucasian Shepherd’s jaws clamped down on the arm. 

The creature then began to claw at the Caucasian Shepherd with its free hand. Usually this wouldn’t be a problem for the Caucasian Shepherd as there long fur would act as a shield against there skin when they fight wolves in Russia but since it was the summer time, her neck and body was exposed since the fur was too short. I was basically pinned in the ground as the two where fighting above me. 

The Caucasian Shepherd did manage to move from the arm to the creatures neck but this somehow didn’t kill the creature. The Creature yelled out in pain but since the Caucasian Shepherd was too weak from its injuries to really continue the bite around the neck, the creature managed to push the Caucasian Shepherd of it’s neck. It looked like the fight was about to turn in favour for the Creature, but L grabbed a large stick nearby and swung it at the back of the creatures hear which barely did anything as the Creature then turned towards him, grabbing the stick as L went for the 2nd swing, this allowed the Caucasian Shepherd to jump onto the creatures back and sink in another bite to the creatures shoulder. Clearly to injured to continue the Creature got the Caucasian Shepherd off itself before it ran/hooped away into the Bush out of sight. 

We all just ran out of the bush as fast as we could to get back to P’s house. P and L where crying as I was limping barely able to keep up. We didn’t care that we entered the home. We needed an adult, so P run upstairs to his mothers room as L was checking my cuts and the Caucasian Shepherd’s wounds but all we heard from upstairs was a scream from P’s mum as she brought him down stairs by the ear wearing lingerie and a man in his underwear who was not P’s father walking down stairs behind her. 

She was pissed (Aussie Slang referring to someone being either Drunk or Extremely Angry, in this case she was not drunk) but after seeing the Caucasian Shepherd’s injuries and my scratches she calmed down and told her male friend to leave, which he accepted and quickly went back upstairs to get his things before leaving. She quickly got changed. It was L who told her what happened and simply said that it was a Feral Large Dog. She believed him and she then took the Caucasian Shepherd to a vet while L took me to a doctor since he had a car.

The Caucasian Shepherd unfortunately died in 2019 not due her injuries. While the Golden Retriever is still alive and well. P and L said nothing about P’s mothers situation to P’s father but he somehow found out around New Years and filed for Divorce. I don’t know much about the Divorce besides the fact that P’s Mother hit P’s Dad with an AVO that he did not deserve, (AVO is kind of like a restraining order) naturally causing issues in the Divorce.

As for the Creature itself after doing some research online including watching YouTube videos like that of channels like MR Ballen, What Lurks Benefit, MR Nightmare and Darkness Prevails, the most likely thing that it could be is a Skinwalker, but I do have my doubts as I live in Australia and not the USA so honestly I don’t know what we encounter but what I do know is that when I do decide to get a Dog, the Caucasian Shepherd is in my top 10 for obvious reasons.

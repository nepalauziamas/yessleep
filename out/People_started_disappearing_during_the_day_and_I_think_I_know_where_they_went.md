I walked down the empty street with very few people spread around. It reminded me of the uptick of disappearances in our town lately. I felt hungry and saw a nearby food stand. It was one of those tiny mobile cart ones on wheels. I walked up to the stand and got a good look at the owner.  


A decrepit old man who was blind in one eye. His skin was abnormally shriveled up, his muscles were so small you would believe he is skin and bones. He had a red t-shirt with blue denim jeans. His shoes looked brand new with red splotches on them. His teeth were yellow and some fell out when he opened his mouth.  


I waited for him to say something as he just stared at me. I moved around yet his eyes only moved to track everything. I squatted down and heard a soft splashing. A red liquid was dripping from the bottom of the cart where a small rusted hole was and into a puddle. I got back up and said  


“Uh sir? Your cart happens to be leaking. You should check that out.”  


The man quickly looks to his right and gets on all fours crawling to the hole and begins lapping up the red liquid before covering the hole with tape. He started angrily grumbling and glared at me. I felt unwanted and uneasy, I just wanted to get food and be out of there.  


I choked out the words after a period of awkward heavy silence.  


“I would like a hot dog please, with mustard if you can.”  


The man smiled and leaned forward to slide the case open with steam pillowing out. He used pliers to grab a hot dog and used his bare hands to grab a bun. Watching him made me regret coming here in the first place.  


I felt disgusted and horrified at the unhygienic licking of something that could only be described as blood. Not to mention that he touches everything with his bare hands. I held my arm and felt the sweat drip down my neck. He reached out with the hot dog with one hand. His eyes grew bloodshot and watery, he smiled even bigger. He whimpered out words as he reached downward slowly and suspiciously with his right arm.  


“Here… Take it… It’s on the house kid”  


I saw a glint from his right side and saw it was a large kitchen knife with red stains and rust all over it. I trusted my gut and didn’t reach for the sausage. He got angry and yelled, saliva dripping down his face and flying outwards.  


“You bastard, I made you a hot dog for free and you suddenly aren’t interested?”  


He jumped on top of the card and launched towards me with his kitchen knife. I screamed and ran to the left, not stopping. I looked back to see the man quickly running towards me with his bloody knife in hand. I pulled out my pepper spray and got him in the eyes.  


He fell to the ground and screamed in pain. He swiped and swung his knife in all directions while clutching his good eye. He screamed brutal death threats and obscenities. I dialed 911 quickly while keeping track of the man.“911, what’s your emergency?”  


I desperately try to choke up the words while catching my breath.  


“Hello?! There is this old man who tried to kill me with a knife, I think it has blood stains on it. Can you get here quickly?”  


I gave them my location and waited for her response. Even though it was a few seconds it felt like an eternity.  


“Alright, the police are on their way.”  


I felt a tinge of relief from the fact the police were on their way. I hung up as the man had run away from me leaving his knife behind. He weakly pushes the cart away. He took out the brown bag and threw it into a nearby alleyway, then continued fleeing.  


The cop car pulled up and I pointed towards the knife and showed them the direction he went. The two officers called for backup and drove off to get him. When The officers left I used a stick to open the brown bag when I got to the alley.  


I was terrified. There were passports, wallets, money, keys, and other items. I ran away from the  alley and went home. Horrible thoughts raced through my mind. If I was a bit slower, or didn’t have my critical thinking, I would have ended up like them.

I run a private campground.  I have a set of rules to keep everyone safe and we’ve finally done it.  We’re at the last rule.  You can all stop reading after this point.  We’re done.  I’m out of rules to talk about.  I’m sure this is what you were really after and you’re not actually invested in [everything else](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/km8etp/how_to_survive_camping_the_motherless/) that goes on around here.  The fomorian and the thing in the dark and Beau and the bad year and all is sure to just… work itself out.

Please don’t panic and leave comments, I’m one of those people that never shuts up I guess and I’m still alive so you’re not rid of me just yet.

Anyway, if you’re new here, you should really [start at the beginning](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/clp5h4/how_to_survive_camping/) and if you’re totally lost, [this might help](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/comments/fz6a1d/how_to_survive_camping_index/).

Rule #13: If you are wandering the campsite with friends and you discover that one has gone missing, contact camp staff immediately. Under no circumstances should you try to find them yourselves, not even if you discover that they’re only a short distance away. That might not actually be your friend.

I had my first encounter with rule #13 in highschool.  I was a freshman.  I’d gone hunting with my parents before then, but it was for smaller things, like the gummy bears.  Things that could be easily dispatched without much real danger.  This was the first time my dad took me along for something bigger, something that couldn’t be trapped easily and had to be killed in the open.  I remember my mother sitting down with me beforehand to explain why this particular creature was different.

“It’s tempting to think of it like a zombie,” she said, “but that’s a dangerous mistake to make.  Always assume these inhuman things are faster and stronger than you.”

But we were more clever.  Not smarter - that was another mistake to make.  Clever.  They acted in predictable ways and we could do as we willed.  That was what made us so different from all of these things on the campground and why we stood a chance against them.  We could do the unexpected.  We could bring weapons.  We could alter our tactics.  And most of all - we could use their own rules against them.

She fussed with my charm vest as she said this, making sure it was fastened correctly.  There weren’t any talismans or wards that worked on these creatures, but it was smart to wear it anyway as an extra layer of protection and to keep anything opportunistic away.  A human interacting with the inhuman world was a trespass.  The campground belonged to our family, but once we crossed the line and touched the things that were not of our world, we were now in their domain.  It was like a beacon.  Those familiar with our family might simply ignore our presence.  Others might draw near in search of easy prey.  Or worse - knowing full well who we are and seeking us out with malicious intent.

I think this is why Beau is able to find me so easily when things are going wrong.

What were you doing your freshman year?  Joining marching band?  Trying out for sports?  Applying for your first job?  I was heading into the woods with my dad with a shotgun under one arm and an axe on my belt to kill something that was once human.  It’s little wonder I turned out as ruthless as I sometimes am.

I’d picked the axe.  Dad liked to carry a baseball bat.  Granted, it was custom made out of some kind of wood with special significance and had symbols and glyphs carved all over it, but it was still essentially a baseball bat.  He’d played baseball as a kid and that just felt natural to him as a weapon.

If you’re wondering why I chose an axe, it’s because my parent’s favorite punishment was to make me chop wood.  I chopped a lot of wood as a kid.

I don’t think I was a *bad* kid… I was just… angry.  And talked back a lot.  I’m sure this surprises no one.

But the evening I went out with my dad I wasn’t angry.  I was anxious.  Perhaps a little excited.  This was a sign that I was becoming an adult, after all, and that I was being entrusted with the grown-up responsibilities of the campground.  It was near the end of the camping season, so we left late at night when most of the campers were hopefully asleep.  I rode on the back of the four-wheeler, just behind dad.

When my brother was a freshman, our mom took him for his first kill.  He’s never talked about it.  But I remember hearing our parents talking a few days later in hushed voices, when they thought no one was eavesdropping.  They were worried Tyler wasn’t suitable to inherit the campground, should it ever fall to him.  Not that he *couldn’t* do it, but rather that he would hate it.  They didn’t want either of their children to be miserable.

“I think Kate will be fine,” my dad finally sighed.  “She’s strong.  She loves this land.”

A long silence.

“You love it too,” my mother said.

“I know.”

I wondered for a long time why my dad sounded so sad when he said that.  I think, now that I own the house and sleep with the beast haunting my nightmares, I understand a little better.  This campground is the sweetest of curses.

But freshman Kate knew none of this.  She was only excited to go hunting with her dad to deal with a *real* monster.

The campground felt different this time.  Certainly, I’d been out after dark plenty of times, but there was an undercurrent this time, like electricity.  The night felt more alive.  There were things lurking out in the darkness and this time, we were coming for them.  I’d spent my whole life learning how to avoid or hide from them and now - finally - *finally* \- I was going to hunt one down.  I felt like the heroine.  I was going to save the campground.

It doesn’t feel that way anymore.  It just feels like I’m doing my job.

One of the staff reported a deer carcass earlier in the day.  Pieces of it were missing.  The ribs, mostly.  The meat was left untouched.  This was an indication of an inhuman thing and since the organs were intact, it ruled out quite a few options.  Combined with the disappearance of a camper some weeks prior, my parents were fairly certain we were dealing with what would become rule #13.

These creatures seek out specific prey.  It is one of the ways we have an advantage over them.  If we know the requirements, we can easily set the bait and meet them on our terms.  In this case, the creature preys on people looking for it.  It appears to people that know its face, standing off a bit from the road, just enough to draw them out of sight of any potential passer-bys.

The forest muffles sound, I think.  We rarely get calls about gunshots and when we do, it’s usually one that occurred off of the campground.  We only get calls about screams when it’s too late for the caller to flee.

It usually takes people who walk in pairs.  One of them is enticed off the road - and the survivor, should they resist going after their friend - cannot explain how this is done.  They say they were just walking along and noticed that their companion was missing and after a few minutes of confused searching, they saw them again some yards away from the road.  The smart ones call for their friend to catch up without leaving the road, and keep walking.  If it really is their friend, they usually do, somewhat annoyed perhaps at being left behind.  If it isn’t their friend… well, at least they survived the encounter.  The other person is never seen again, at least, not as anything human.

Those that go after their friend are found dead.  Their body mutilated and pieces removed.  Bones, mostly.  This thing favors bones.

It isn’t always hunting a single person.  These creatures - or creature, we’re not certain - have taken groups before.  We lost five campers once, during my tenure as manager.  Their bodies were arrayed in a circle, facing outwards.  It was difficult to tell what the fatal wounds had been, as their torsos were torn open, but all of them were ripped apart on the back and not the front, so it had been done from behind.  They’d tried to flee, in all directions, and been cut down as they ran.

It had taken their spines and when I found it, it teetered out of the woods with its head balanced precariously on a sinuous column of vertebrae, wavering like a snake.  It continued to move even after I shot through the spinal column, lashing back and forth, until I drove my axe through the skull.

The one I hunted with my father hadn’t much success hunting humans, so it’d resorted to other prey.  The deer was an indicator that its time was growing short.  It was getting desperate.  It was ripe to take the bait of the two of us driving slowly along the road late at night, not conversing, searching for a missing person.  We swept our flashlights back and forth on the road, periodically scanning the trees.  And after about an hour, we found him.

He stood a bit off between two large trees.  He held up a hand in greeting as we placed our lights on him and beckoned for us to come closer.

“Look at his chest,” my dad whispered.

I did.  There were stark ridges underneath his shirt.  A ribcage on the outside of his chest.  I thought of the rotting deer, the meat untouched, the bones missing.

We readied our weapons and followed it off the road.  I went first with my dad at my back.  They’d coached me on what to do before we left.  Fire the shotgun before we reached it.  Aim for the legs.  Then step in close with the axe and finish it off.  Never give it a chance to use its superior abilities against us.

I raised the shotgun when we were only a yard apart.  My gaze happened to glance up at movement, as he stretched his lips apart in a facsimile of a smile.  There were teeth.  Teeth on the inside of his lips, growing out of the flesh.  Human teeth.

Two people had vanished.  One was found, the body mutilated.  My parents hadn’t said which parts were missing.

Shocked, I hesitated.  It lunged for me, half-falling forwards, and the ribs underneath its shirt tore through the fabric, stretching out wide like spikes to receive my body.  I fired the shotgun, stumbling backwards as I did.  The shot went high, shredding its torso instead.  It was knocked back, but not down, and with my heart pounding and my mouth dry with terror, I grabbed my axe instead.

I was panicking, but at least I was panicking in a *useful* way.

I’m not sure when that panic turned to anger.  Perhaps they’ve always been a face on the same coin.

I ran at the thing, too afraid to even yell a battle cry, and I brought the axe down in a familiar arc, honed by all those horrible hours in the backyard, splitting wood until my palms were blistered.  The axe sunk deep into the man’s shoulder and with a wrench, I ripped it clean off.  The creature shrieked, a gurgling sound, as if the throat was *loose* inside its neck.  It fell forwards, its ribs catching on my charm vest.  I got the axe between us, pressing the shaft against its neck as it leered at me, mouth gaping.  There was another tongue, at the back of its throat.  A deer’s tongue.

Revolted, I shoved hard, pushing it away from me and with a rip, my charm vest tore off, dangling from its ribs.  I staggered for only a moment and then with a strength fueled by adrenaline, I swung the axe sideways and buried it deep into the creature’s neck.  Another sharp wrench and the head flopped sideways, hanging from its body by only a thin strip of skin.

It was a simple matter after that to take out the knees and smash the skull.  Panting, I stood there in the ruins of its body, covered in blood and bits of bone and flesh.  I was shaking.  This wasn’t what I’d expected.  This wasn’t heroic or glorious.  It was just… messy.  I felt hollow inside.

It was an important thing I learned that day.  No one will celebrate what I do.

Then I looked to my father, wondering why on earth he hadn’t helped at all.  He just announced that he knew I could do it and went to get the four-wheeler to transport the body back to the house.

I found out years later that my dad had a revolver trained on it the whole time.  He’d moved to stand slightly to the side and behind me so that he had a clear shot where I wasn’t behind the creature.  If it looked like things were going to go badly, he’d intervene.  Otherwise, this was something I had to do for myself.

I tried to muster up some sense of pride as we shoveled the body into trash bags.  I dropped a few hints to my dad, hoping for his praise.  Instead, he stopped and gently turned the body’s head around so that the face was staring up at me.  Its eyes were still open and its mouth was parted as if with surprise.

“Look hard,” my dad said.  “This was a person.  Do you know his name?”

I didn’t.  I felt ashamed admitting that.  Dad told me who he was, who his friends were that reported him missing, and what family members were waiting for news of his fate.  Then he told me to close the man’s eyes, respectfully, and put the head with the rest of its body so that it could be cremated with dignity at the funeral home.

I remember feeling sullen.  Wondering why any of this mattered - he’d ventured into the woods.  He’d ignored the signs of danger.  This was just what happened and now we had to clean up the mess he’d caused.  What of his friends?  I had none that would worry about *me* if I vanished someday.  The entire concept felt alien to me.

Little wonder my parents decided that my dad would be the one to take me hunting.  Even then, I was too much like my mother.  It is the duty of parents to remove the worst aspects of themselves from their children.  I wonder if any actually succeed.

When we got back, Mom wouldn’t let me in the house.  She had me strip in the garage and then go immediately to the shower.  Considering I was covered with gore, I honestly can’t blame her.  When I got out, dad was taking cookies out of the oven.  He said that his dad gave him his first drink of whiskey after his first hunting trip like this, but knowing my sweet tooth he felt this was more appropriate.

Dad was also considerably younger than I was when he had to kill something that looked human.  Grandpa was a hard man.  Times were different back then.

Thirty minutes after we got home I started crying.  Neither of my parents were surprised.  Mom just sat me down in the kitchen and brought me tissues and some milk to go with the cookies.  This was normal, she told me.  Sometimes people cry when adrenaline crashes.  I’d probably grow out of it.  Or I might not.  Either way, it was nothing to be ashamed about.  She was right.  I did grow out of it, but only after many years of crying almost exactly thirty minutes after anything happened that got my adrenaline up.  The body is a funny thing, sometimes.

So that’s rule #13.  There’s lots of things we could nickname this creature, but seeing as we might have inadvertently *named* the harvesters, let’s *not.*  Let’s just call it rule #13.  It’ll be awkward, but it might be safer.

I’m sure you’re all thinking - so what went wrong with this rule, since it’s a bad year and Kate is finally getting around to talking about it?  Just the usual, honestly.  Someone went missing.  Their campmates contacted us when they didn’t show up for a full day and we got the police involved and fabricated a cover story.  Convinced them to leave early, too, so that they wouldn’t spread rumors or worse: encounter their missing friend.

We couldn’t determine for certain it was rule #13, obviously, as there’s so many things that could have gotten to this poor person.  However, they left some photos behind to identify them with.  I put up copies in the staff break room.  We *do* try to give people closure and hey, sometimes they turn up alive.  Seriously.  This wouldn’t be the first person to have an epiphany while camping out here and run off to rethink their life and turn up months later in another town, perfectly fine and now free of whatever job, vice, or relationship they thought was holding them back.  Camping on old land does that to a person.  Makes you wonder who you are and sometimes, well, sometimes they realize they aren’t happy with themselves and decide to do something about it.

Sadly, that isn’t the case this time.  Yesterday my staff radioed that they’d found the missing person.  He was standing off to the side of the road as my employee drove by on one of our few surviving four-wheelers.  My employee didn’t stop, but got a good look as they drove past.  The man watched, turning his head to keep his gaze fixed on my employee the entire time.  He smiled, slowly, as if imitating a gesture he’d seen other people make and uncertain if it was correct.  My employee eased up on the gas a little, as there was something off about the man’s expression and he wanted a better look.  Like the man couldn’t stretch his lips far enough because something was in the way.  My employee smiled back, an open-mouthed smile, and the man was quick to mimic it.

His tongue was missing.  It had been replaced with the tip of a deer’s antler.

My staff member didn’t stick around to see any more.  That was enough for him.  He gunned the throttle and got out of the deep woods, calling me up on the radio to tell me what he’d seen as he did.  I told him to keep moving and we’ll figure out a plan to deal with the missing camper later.

Normally I just let them rot apart.  If we get a wet enough spring they’ll be mostly gone before the first campers arrive.  However, with the way this winter seems to be going, I’m not optimistic we’ll get enough days above freezing to start that process early enough.  I think we might need to put this one down ourselves.

I’m a campground manager.  There’s many lessons that my parents tried to teach me that didn’t sink in until later.  Some I’m still trying to understand.  And the things yet to learn… I wonder how much they didn’t even begin to teach me before the little girl and the beast took them from us.  All I’m left with is my mother’s journals and those were for her, not me.  They aren’t my mother’s voice, telling me that inaction means death and that it is better to fight poorly than to not fight at all.  My father’s steadying presence isn’t here, waiting with a weapon should I falter.

It’s just me.  Me and my anger and the memories of my parents. [\[x\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/)

Hello again. Ruxandra broadcasting.

Check in the previous part in here  [https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/wc704p/helena\_the\_clown\_part\_10/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/wc704p/helena_the_clown_part_10/)

It has ended. I do not know if it is for good. Yet, some cycle is closed. So, I need to ”release” you as well, all those who read all I had to say. I can not finish the story tonight, as I wished, but I have a final word tomorrow, just to close.

&#x200B;

First things first. I am sorry for cutting short the story of the last night of Helena in the 1930ties, the last night of her old life. It was an overwhelming state for me. I think I am pretty chill now, after all, and be able to resume. I shall share all I have managed to get and put in order so far about that night, then I shall share what myself experienced lately.

&#x200B;

Some small thing. Before starting, I want to share a small piece of information I forgot last time. A few days before that night that started at Roata Lumii, Helena was seen in a pub. A shot of pălinca. A song of Jean Moscopol called ”Mână birjar” was playing. Helena took from time to time a sip of pălinca during the song then, after finished the drink, kept the small glass in her hand. Her head was to the ground, a clear, deep sadness was o her face. The song is about a man who has lost his love and fells into alcoholism due to it. I wonder what she was thinking, how did she felt. Hopeless, disgusted of her life, of the city she lived into... Perhaps something of the song fit her mindset and she had an idea then, or soon after, when she left the pub, going towards Obor. Ok now, I shall pick from where I left the previous post.

&#x200B;

Helena left with some people, not many yet, to Mahalaua Dracului. It was not very far. Some people that so the crowd fled, others joined, as Helena told the ones already involved to call others, in helping cleaning up the mess from Mahalaua Dracului. All the Victoriei (Victory) Square was traversed and they reached Șoseaua Basarab, that is now the boulevard Nicolae Titulescu. They have decided to enter from Șoseaua Basarab, not the Dr. Felix street, risking the separation. Helena moved her left hand slowly in the air and a weak grey mist surrounded Helena, then the carriage, then the people. ”Do not worry,” shouted Helena. You are safe in the mist. It is for out own use. So, tell me where are them. In order.”

&#x200B;

Some people she had talked on the road gave her the name of the two of the ”professors”. Helena went to the house of the first, could not find him, so she went to the second house. She starting shouting into the streets for people for find them and handle them. Some were afraid at first, but the ones already with her started telling them to listen to Helena, that she will kill all the criminals, especially the ”professors”. Finding the second on the list changed the feel of the movement. She placed his head in hot beer, then slit his throat, mixing the blood with beer. After his intestines were on his fence, she shouted again: ”Give me all who follow them. The smallest ones and the big ones.” His eyes were like on fire. Slowly, people starting telling names and places. She went there and got them without much judgement, it seems. She burned them with hot beans or hot beer, opened their abdomens then after killing them, but to some when they were still alive.

&#x200B;

There were some dummies that the ”professors” used to train young criminals how to rob, hurt and kill. She piled up some five bodies in the middle of the street, alongside the dummies, covered them in alcohol and set them on fire. Even houses where the ”teaching” happened were set on fire. Some people, who were criminals or relatives of them, tried to fled. Some succeeded, some were killed. Others joined the crowd who started to enjoy what was going on. Yet it was all possible that some small criminals joined the crowd to escape and to use the occasion for other harms. People started arguing about who of them was a criminal or not. Helena silenced the scandals, listening to several testimonies. Then she decided on the spot life or death.

&#x200B;

In the end, some police entered, but the mob attacked the cars, setting them of fire. Some people were shot but, in the end, after Helena„s intervention, all the guns were seized and set on her carriage. It seems that, sometime at this point, Gâlmă appeared in there. Probably Helena called him with some normal means, like the phone from Roata Lumii. I do not think it is anything supernatural like telepathy involved. If it were, they would have managed much better what they did that night. Helena and Gâlmă started talking near the carriage, when the crowd was around them and the ruins of burned houses and charred corpses. Most of the leftovers of the food and drink went they took from Roata Lumii to use as weapons were given to the crowd. A part of the alcohol was kept to be used as weapons for fire, later. Helena drank some tzuika or pălinca and kept some in a small bottle, on her waist.

&#x200B;

”We need to go to the railways workshop, in Grivița. Fast. To stir up as many people as we an from there or Giulești. What do you think is the fastest way? From Banu Manta through Griviței Way (Calea Griviței) or through the small streets ahead, to get some more people on the way, kill some of the bastards in there and then reach the end of the Grant bridge?” asked Helena. Gâlmă replied: ”If it worked so far, it seems we can gather some more. There are enough brigands even just north of this, until there, to get rid of and so, find new people willing to join us. But I am worried it shall take too much and the police shall reach us.” ”I have scared some already. They shall bring reinforcements, indeed, but we need more people. Those from the railways workshop know us, some of them live nearby. And, besides, we have some guns. 

&#x200B;

The police cars we have got our hands on are not enough to transport all of them. I do not think we can also gathered more carriages and cars to get all of them. Police may come faster, due to their cars. But small streets are better for marching, I guess, it would be harder to attack on open boulevards. They may wait for us at the bottom of the Grant bridge. Do Damandake (This was the probable name of the ”gentleman” clown.), Zerva and the rest have started to arise the people from Colentina and Obor?” continued Helena.

&#x200B;

”I told them to.”replied Gâlmă.” I do not know how they shall manage, there are several people who they could gather at the fair of Obor. From the Mask Factory or from Aversa. Police may be on their way. They need to be phoned before we start marching now towards Grant bridge. They need to leave fast, to get to Eliza Filipescu street. And, as you well know, they are not as capable as you, especially Zerva. If yourself were there, it is pretty sure you could gather more, not just from there, but from the Assan Mill, from Tonola (the bricks factory from the edge of Colentina, where the state circus is now. We need more people, indeed, but there is little time. Besides, there is the risk of police coming there, so they need to be on the move. I think we need to call them now, not when we reach Grant.”

&#x200B;

”You are right.” said Helena. ”They need the signal to proceed now.” So they managed to make a phone call from one of the houses, it seems and they went on marching on the streets between the Banu Manta street, the Filantropia boulevard, Griviței Way to the Grant bridge. There are testimonies of fires and some small destruction in the Obor fair, and small crowd starting to march over the Colentina Highway, then to Maica Domnului, then towards the Barbu Văcărescu Boulevard. It became, gradually, bigger, but not much bigger. It seems they had some guns with them, and torches, like the crowd around Helena. 

&#x200B;

There was some police involvement, some fires, it appears some people were shot. Police was repelled, eventually, but it took longer and some more casualties. They needed to break through the hippodrome of Floreasca (Today if does not exist anymore, there are streets with small apartment blocks.), and use then the small streets from Floreasca, and the small street Andrei Mureșanu. That will prove to be a mistake, in the end, because the diversion thought by Helena for them to come through Victoriei, to prevent the police from understanding their first real target, will be blown, when they went through Andrei Mureșanu. It is not known which of them decided to through north, perhaps to avoid the Bonaparte Highway.

&#x200B;

A grey mist covered both crowd about a kilometer around, turning the summer night into some faux autumn misty night, but still warm, like summer. It seems the idea of marching alongside small streets was a good one. Today, on the Grant area, there is a much larger, wider bridge, and the former street of Turda was turned into a boulevard. But, back then, things looked different. There were many workers living in the area, near the workshops. Poor people who, like other poor people, hated the regime. They send people before them to call some more, announcing the uprising, to join. Fortunately for them, there was no clear sign of the police in the Grant area, so they went on the bridge. Helena waited a while for Gâlmă, along several people, to go near the beginning of the Giulești area, to call for people and, in no more then 15 minutes, gather whoever they can.

&#x200B;

Some of the people who joined being workers at the workshops, managed to get in and some materials to improvise into bottles ways to start fires. Also tools were taken to be used as weapons. From Giulești there come some lăutari and give them the task to play folk music, but on a military march rhythm, using strong drums. Some say there could have been as much as 1000 people, some say even 2000. We do not know what was real, 1000 seems a more realistic number. They returned to the other side of Grant and started marching fast to the south. Now they hurried up and stopped gathering  more people.

&#x200B;

At this time, there was a phone call to the police that stated the crowd wants to reach downtown, coming through Victoriei Square, this seemed to have been a diversion made by someone who was part of mob, probably Helena„s idea to make authorities think their target was a different one.

&#x200B;

Slowly, from Calea Griviței area, the mist started to grow and engulf larger ares, especially to the north and east. Those who took part at that march and remember it gave testimony that there was weird, partially scary, partially mentally arousing feeling. Like they felt something powerful in that mist, like moving them to another place. The city seemed unusually quiet, and that seemed eerie peaceful.

&#x200B;

Yet, while marching from the Grant bridge to the Basarab bridge, two bridges that were not too distant one from the other, both covering the same railway area, something was felt, then seen. Some dark, distant, vaguely humanoid figures with wings were above the mist, from time to time, above the crowd. A weird, distant, but strong (I know it sound kinda of a contradiction, both distant and strong, but this is how some people managed to describe it.) fear came with the sightings. Helena and Gâlmă looked up. Gâlmă noted: ”You see them too, isn„t it?” ”Yes.”, answered calmly Helena. ”Somebody does not like what is happening. I wonder how fast shall they interfere and how. For now, they are still up.” Then she said to the crowd behind: ”Stay close to us and stay together. They want you to be afraid, if you want to be safer, do as I say.” Some people left the crowd, but most stayed.

&#x200B;

They reached Basarab bridge and there, on the street, there was a surprise right in the middle of the road. In the mist, without very clear shape, there were the silhouettes of two tall women, dressed in white, long dresses. One had blonde hair, one had read hair. They glowed in the dark with some kind of aura, their eyes were bright, like blue lanterns, their skin very pale, virtually white, their features unearthly beautiful, yet terrible. Helena stopped the march and people started to whisper in fear: ”Ielele!”

&#x200B;

”Ielele” a name given in Romania to the Dark Elves. Dark in this case does not mean necessary evil, but dark in intentions. Ielele are a type of dark intention Zână, a type of figure in Romanian folklore mythology, not being clear how much they are evil in themselves or how much they became dangerous when mortals meet them. The translation of the name ”zână” in English is, probably, Elf, not Fairy, how it is, usually, translated. We see this profile of being in many folkloric mythologies in Europe, having different names in different cultures but, at least somewhat, similar profiles. The term Elf comes from the Germanic peoples, being related with an old term for white (a reference, maybe, to their white clothes) including the English, the Irish called them Sidhe, the Slavic people Villa, the ancient Greeks Nymphs (that meant ”bride” in ancient Greek, again, probably a reference to their, mostly, white clothing), modern Greeks Nereids (actually, in ancient Greek ”Nereid” meant a water Nymph, the term evolved, in time, to refer to all Nymphs). When seen in their natural shape, they usually appear dressed in white. There are references of them wearing some sort of magical masks that make them appear Human or invisible, sometimes being able to shapeshift into white swans. Scandinavian people consider Elves being able to live under a Human identity in a Human society, using their masks.

&#x200B;

Very often, when they are met in their natural form, it is in nature, usually forest, during dances or celebrations, and that meant for the mortal death or some other serious harm. In the last century, in Romania were seen, mostly, in remote areas, although there are testimonies of them in the XIXth century Bucharest, Balkanic peoples fear them greatly, almost of a much as they fear ghosts or undead beings. They can lure people with their siren-like abilities to their deaths or to mutilation or illness. So, seeing Elves scarred the people, some panicked. Helena turned to them: ”Brace yourselves and stay put! I shall talk to them.” She went to the Elves.

&#x200B;

The blonde Elf started talking in a very beautiful voice, but on a sharp, harsh tone: ”You broke our agreement. How dare you?” Helena replied: ”No, I have not. Our agreement does not cover them. It is very clear, when I enter your domain and business, with business of my own, to stay out of your business, as I stay out of yours. You are the one who interfere now.” The red haired Elf asked; ”What on Earth is this? What do you think you are doing?” Helena replied with a kinda fierce, but respectful tone: ”The two of us and the people do some clean up. We are all sick of living with all that scum. We are going to get rid, as best as we can, the country of the scumbags that sell it and destroy it. Please stay out of way.” ”You are mad!” replied the blonde Elf. ”A bunch of people, against them? They shall kill both you and the Humans alongside with you. We are here to stop you.”

&#x200B;

”Stop me?” replied Helena. ”You may be strong and ancient, but I am also strong. I do not know whoever of us is stronger. We can try and see right here and right now, but I guess you would not like it either.” The red haired Elf looked angry at Helena: ”You have any idea how old I am? What I can do to you? How dare you disrespect us?” ”Well”, replied Helena, ”I may be much younger then you, but I am immortal as well. And I am not going to live centuries and ages on this Earth like this. Perhaps, since the ancient days of your great power gone, you have learned to live in hiding, in secrecy, feeling powerful at one to one level with a Human, but fearing them as a whole knowing that their great power is in their numbers and they can get rid of you, if you do not hide yourselves. Honestly, I do not know how can you stand and see the centuries, for some of you millennia, go by and go on. Look around you! We all live in a world that gets dirties, submerged in wickedness as time goes by. Myself I can not stand it. Not anymore.”

&#x200B;

After a few seconds of silence, Helena continued: ”You have a choice, from my perspective. You can either stay out of our way, or join us. We have work to do, a great work to do, and you keep us blocked.” The blonde Elf replied, of a different tone: ”A great work? Have you looked at the sky? You have seen them and felt them too, both yourselves and the Humans.” They seemed to have refer to the winged dark figures present in the sky a few minutes ago. ”Of course” said Helena. ”For now they did not came down. They want to intimidate us. This means a great deed is ahead us and it means this should make us even more determined to succeed. ” ”You have lost it.” said the red haired Elf. ”I see it now. If you were still sane, you would have realized there is no way a few people can bring down the power. But it seems talking to you is senseless already, since you seem determined to kill yourselves and get all this people to death.” 

&#x200B;

”You know what?” continued the Blonde Elf. ”I guess you have seen there was no police at Grant. Wondered why? The army is coming. From Drumul Taberei they started the march. They come in vehicles, you are on foot. They bring war munition. And guess what? It seems your master was seen with Siguranta (the Political Police).”

&#x200B;

Helena became quiet. After a little while, she replied, on a calmer tone and lower voice: ”He is not my master. He may sell me to them. He already took my Human life. I knew that, if I start something like this, it will be my end, one way or the other. But things can not go on as they are.” The blond Elf replied: ”You can decide for yourself, you have no right to bring al these people to death. If you do that, you are no better then the one who turned you into what you are.” Helena stood up quiet at the sky, and replied: ”They came out of their own will. But I guess that, on this you are right. I shall tell them.”

&#x200B;

She turned to the people: ”Good folks! It seems the scumbags send the army for us. With war munition. Myself I shell continue. We have our right to live with dignity. We have our right to be free. I tell you this so that you know what is coming. I can not force you to continue. But, as I already told you, as much of us, the better. We can do this. Some of us may die. But we shall die as heroes, nonetheless. Remember, the more of us we are, the less powerful they are. If we are alone, they take us one by one and crush us!”  Some people left. It seems many. Some were talking, being undecided. 

&#x200B;

So, she added: ”Whatever you do, decide fast. They are coming. We need to move on.” She waited for a few minutes, then she decided to continue the march on the Basarab Boulevard, that now is called Titulescu, as the Elves disappeared into the mist, towards Gara de Nord.  She had entered Mahalaua Dracului on the other end of the boulevard, but this time, they should not reach the same area, but switch mid way to Banu Manta street, and cross over the spot they first left Mahalaua Dracului to reach the Grant area.

&#x200B;

When they were close to leave to enter the Banu Manta street, they felt again the dark presences above them. Something felt intoxicating, hard to pinpoint what. People left at the march felt bad in their abdomens, even Helena and Gâlmă seem to be affected. ”Ignore them, for now.” she shouted. Do not look at them at all, do not listen any sound that comes from them. They try to poison us.” Some big tree moved and started producing some weird sounds, people started to get scared again, Helena calmed them down again and went to talk, discretely, with the tree or the being that appeared to be a tree. After a few minutes, she went back to the crowd and continued marching. Gâlmă asked: ”What did he want?” ”He did not knew what was going on, I told him the truth. He was a little scared, I told him we will move away from him, and that it seems unlikely his kin from Kiseleff area shall be affected. To chill down. Of course, he told me I am out of mind with all this.” 

&#x200B;

After reaching the end of Banu Manta, they needed to decide if to through south, close to Victoriei Square, but it seemed safer to cross Filantropia boulevard (that now is called Ion Mihalache), through the Barbu Delavrancea street, cross the Kiseleff park and join the other group, the one with Damandake, Zerva and the rest after crossing the park, in the Eliza Filipescu street.

&#x200B;

Then, another surprise from the sky. A new dark shape, much bigger appeared, some people start feeling bad and panic came back, even stronger. They tried to calm people down, others left. Whatever those beings from the sky were doing, made even the clowns feel bad. But they went on. There were still many people. A strange incident happened when they cross Filantropia boulevard. On the sidewalk, there was frail young man, with round glasses. He looked intrigued to the crowd, to Helena and Gâlmă, but not with fear at all. He made a sign to the crowd to stop, and people obeyed. He parted them with ease and went to Helena. For a few moments, he and Helena looked at each other, like a Human and an alien, trying to understand what is the other. Eventually, the young man smiled and saluted Helena with a salute of military kind, as a sign of respect and recognition. Helena hesitated a few seconds, then returned the same salute. The young man shook his hat, then we left towards downtown, on Filantropia. Helena restarted the march.

&#x200B;

When they reached the park, eventually, they met the other group in the park. It seems Helena became very angry when she so them in park. ” I told you to go south! Now he left, most likely! We were suppose to make them think we go south. Not to Eliza Filipescu!” Damandake looked a little shaken, Zerva wanted to respond, Helena came to her and cover her mouth with her hands. ”You, please shut up! There is a small chance he is still there. Lets go!” They crossed the park and the boulevard for their target of Eliza Filipescu. The buildings were silent, the silence of the misty night was slowly replaced by a rumble of car engines coming from the south. Helena made a sign to stop, then they listened. 

&#x200B;

Another rumble also seem to come from the north. That meant one thing.  ”They send troops for us from Drumul Taberei. They are close. Someone from the crowd betrayed us and gave them the tip. I do not think they would have been where to attack us from otherwise.” she said.

&#x200B;

Another part of the crowd left in panic, going back to the park, when they heard the soldiers were coming. Some people, not very few, stayed put, alongside the clowns, as the vehicles approached them from Victoriei. The military vehicles, eventually, stopped, and soldiers came out, armed towards the crowd. It is not very clear what happened in the minute, but it was fast. Some other people ran for their lives. Helena shouted: ”Stand your ground! Die with dignity!” The end was coming close. They failed. At some point, soldiers stopped close to the crowd and, from behind the soldiers, came out Gordon Jameson. A deep, silent hatred was seen from the eyes of Helena towards him. He raised his hand in the air and the black mist came out and overcome Helena„s grey mist. Both the crowd and the soldiers were enveloped in the black mist. People lost it and machines guns started firing at the crowd, in almost perfect darkness.

&#x200B;

It seems that even soldiers lost it and things turned into a blood bath, civilians, as well as soldiers were killed. Eventually, we do not know how fast it went, all the mist cleared, the boulevard was filled with dead and wounded people. Siguranta came, and the area was cleared fast. From the clowns, only Gâlmă was found dead. Helena, Zerva, Damandake and the rest were never seen again in Bucharest. At least until the 2020, when Helena appeared again.

&#x200B;

There are some reports of two Siguranta agents who were send to find Gordon Jameson, that they tracked him near the banks of the Colentina river, outside Bucharest, later the same night. He had made up some pile of books and artifacts and rose above them. The agent called him to surrender, he said: „I go to my master who I have dedicated my life. But I go on my own terms, I know my rivals have send you for me, but tell them that nobody shall ever achieve what I did. And I shall make sure it stays so! And we shall never find them, I assure you.” Then he recited some incantations in an unknown language, the agents felt a sharp fear and Jameson burst into flames. A long deafening was heard as the flames consumed the body still standing, the books and the artifacts in minutes. It is not clear is anything was recovered from the pile, after the fire went down.

&#x200B;

I guess there are some things I would like to mention, before moving on what happened those days, the events I also took part, just to close the talk about the past. After what happened with Alexandra and Helena, their families broke down. Alexandra„s mother went to a mental institution, where she died in less then an year. Alexandra„s father, the colonel Protopopescu seemed to bear better, he continued his military career. He eventually became a general, fought in World War II as well. When the soviet army entered the country, he was arrested and condemned to death, for fighting against the Red Army. His sentence was commuted to life in prison and died in the penitentiary of Aiud, in 1949. 

&#x200B;

Spirache, the father of Helena, had a breakdown, he sought for his daughter, even managed to kill some gangsters he suspected were responsible on her abduction. The colonel helped him in many ways, both on trial, and in prison. It is said that, when Helena started to appear a ventriloquist doll in the shows of Jameson, Spirache recognized her, tried to reach her in anger, but he was stopped. He threatened Jameson and he was arrested soon. After spending some years in prison, he manged to escape and live as an outlaw in the forests of the Carpathian forests. It seems that, when he heard of the riot Helena tried on her last night, he would have said: ”That is my little girl.” 

&#x200B;

He was found and imprisoned again by the communists. He met general Prototopescu in prison, it seems they have had a friendship there that helped Spirache enlarge his spiritual horizon. But that is a story for another place and times, I think. He managed to escape again, alongside other convicts, and joined the resistance in the guerilla warfare against the communist regime. In 1952, he and his fellows were, eventually, found by the Securitate (the communist political police that was used also a military police and secret service) and died fighting, in a siege, in the forest. All of them were shut dead, eventually, not before killing many members of the Securitate.

&#x200B;

In a way, the most interesting case was that of Helena„s mother, Safta. She became very pious, prayed a lot, went on pilgrimages and, eventually, was tonsured a nun in the monastery of Pasărea unde the name of Saviana. Mother Saviana lived quite an ascetical life. She became a appreciated spiritual advisor, this was the main reason she was arrested by the communists and sent to prison. There she was considered a beacon and a living saint, a pillar who helped other inmates survive in the harshness of the communist prison regime, when violence, hunger and cold were, often, the easiest part. She dies in 1953, in the penitenciary of Târgșor. Her grave in unknown, but archeologists believe they know the general area of it.

&#x200B;

Now it is time to get back to the present. To the end or... Whatever. I have parked my car close to the area of the decommisioned factory from Șoseaua Electronicii. Called Adrian, he told me to wait for him. I have called father George. He told me he is on his way too. But I was not willing to wait. The place looked silent, at first. The sun was getting ready to set. The railway behind the factory and the apartment blocks behind the railway felt reminiscent of a Russian city, far to the north and the east. The lampposts in the yard were, of course, not on. Perhaps there was no electrical connection in there? I took a deep breath and listened. Silence. Silence. Perhaps this is nothing. Perhaps I was on a wild goose chase. But... I heard them. Voices of men speaking distantly inside. I could not understand at all what they were saying, but they were clearly there. Perhaps this does not mean anything, some homeless people may be inside. But, if I do not enter now, I may need to find a way to live with the idea a child died because I did nothing.  So, I was going in. What was I going to do exactly once in? I did not knew.

&#x200B;

The gate was locked from the outside, with a big lock, but this does not mean there was not another way in. Or perhaps they locked it from the inside, in such to appear it was locked from outside. Can I go over the fence? Trespassing? Yeah, I shall do it. I have said a small prayer. A deep breath and here I go!

&#x200B;

I was a fine, because I wore that day clothes that allowed me to do this pretty easily. I have got a little dirty, but this was just the start. I have made some noise. The yard had some leftover of factory machinery, that now could only be send to be recycle the materials or, at beast, for spare parts (probably there was, technically, little probability for that either). I tried to make some as little noise as possible, but the gravel on the ground made it harder. There was some movement from the building, so I quickly hid behind a machinery. A big man, with big muscles and buzzcut, with black t-shirt came out of the building. Very Eastern European gangster like. So, it seems Marcel was right. 

&#x200B;

A voice came from inside: ”Is there anything?” The man outside replied: ”I shall look.” I needed to keep cool. This is another type of fear then the fear Helena gave. Much less intense but, honestly, more difficult. I needed to remains as rational as possible, not to panic or do something foolish. If they got their hands on me, it was probably game over very soon. Probably not even my dead body would have been found. But I digress, I said to myself, I need to focus on the situation. I slowly moved towards what seemed to be an entrance. The man with the black t-shirt went to the gate. I slowly came close to the entrance. There a little light inside, pretty faint. I came closer. And managed to get in.

&#x200B;

There was nobody in sight, so I tip-toed inside. The light seemed to be only towards the basement, so I walked in. Some corridors, typical industrial architecture. I stopped and listened. There was some faint rumble in one side, so I went on the stairs, even more. There was some movement. Soon, the unavoidable happened. A strong hand grabbed me from the back and fiercely turned me. Another big guy like the one from outside brutally held me. He shouted towards the entrance: ”Ghiță, you moron! Someone got in! Come in here at once!” I have tried to put up a fight and kick him in the stomach, but it seems I was not not fast enough and I got two hits in the rib and one in the head. The guy from outside came rushing in. I was not stopping in fighting, so he threw me to the ground. That was a rough landing... These people had some force, gangsters are famous for their fitness habits and training, far superior to the ones of the police and even the military.

&#x200B;

”Look at this chick.” said the guy who caught me. ”How was this possible? Cougar shall be very angry. Now, what shall we with her?” The other one replied: ”I say to take her to Cougar. She is not leaving this building alive anyway.” He grabbed me from my hair and took me up. ”You know” I have started, there are people who know I am here. And that you are here.” He started laughing sadistically, but yet moronically. ”And will they do? Call the police?” We have reach the bottom, into what seemed to be an improvised operating room. Cougar was there. A bigger guy then the two, more muscles and tattoos. ”What is this?” he shouted. What were you doing outside? Guarding the air?” They threw me to the ground again.

Cougar came down to me, took my face in his hand brutally and said: ”That„s the chick from TV! Heh! This will be funny, when they shall find her dead body. But where and how? Of course, we shall have fun with here before that. But, perhaps our little doctor could find a use for her?” Another man came out from another part of the hall. A man very different from the rest. Dressed in medical clothing, he let down his mask. I knew who he was. He was a professor of medicine, he appeared, from time to time, on TV, a big authority in transplants. About 50, partial grey hair, he looked very competent and professional from second one, before even speaking. Hanson, in his own way. Someone who blindly trusts the appearance would never suspect.

 ”Now, look at that! He said surprised! I know you from TV. You interviewed me some years ago. What are you doing here?” ”Exposing all the scumbags like you.” He smiled. ”How come?” ” People will come for me, who know I am here and why I am here.” I did my best to sound angry and confident. I do not know how it went, I assume lamely.

They all laughed in their own way. Cougar said to the doctor: ”Hey, doc do you think she has good organs?” ”I do not not, he replied. Some analysis need to be performed. On that kid we had them, we knew what we were taking. It shall take a while. It might be worth it.” So Cougar made a sign to Ghiță and command him: ”Tie her up, fast.” He tied my hand in front of me. When they were doing this, I have peeked into a corner of the hall where I seem to have noticed something, so I shouted: ”Damian? Are there?” ”Yes!” the boy screamed. Cougar went to him and smacked him.

”I have an idea.” said the doctor. ”I shall gave her, for now, a little anesthesia, to make her dizzy and unable to walk.” As Cougar kept me down, he came with a syringe at me. I tried to put up a fight, I have even bitten Cougar, who shouted a disgusting slur. The doctor injected some substance in my arm, but I was able to escape, got the syringe out and threw it away. Cougar hit me with his leg in my jaw bone, and that was a harsh one. A strong pain came over me, even speaking would be rough now. I escaped the bound and arose, as Cougar examined his bite wound. I already find hard to stay up, due to injuries. Perhaps the injection started to kick in, because I was feeling dizzy now. Things started to get blurry.

Then I sensed something that froze me on spot. Some small, dark shadows, were sitting on the shoulders of the doctor and Cougar, whispering something in their ears. I knew what they were, that they came from Hell and their mission was to coordinate the evil doings of those people. They were not seen by them, but I have started to see them. I knew from father George I need not to look them in their faces, that I shall loose my mind. So I close my eyes fast. Why did I so them ? I do not know? Perhaps the substances in my bloodstream allowed me to? They jumped at me and, due to fear, I fell to the ground. Some of them felt on chest, I felt a fear like a never felt again, not just intense, but deep. It felt like sleep paralysis, actually. I passed out.

&#x200B;

I was slowly awaken by Cougar shouting: ”Power if out.” I came to my sense. I knew then: She was there. Then I blackout again.

&#x200B;

Ok. One more update on all this. How we all escaped. And the rest. It seems that I need to stop here, although I wanted to tell the end now. Sorry again. See tomorrow, I guess.

For now, Ruxandra out.

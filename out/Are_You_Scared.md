Hello. My name is Jackson, I’m 13 Years old, and there is something in my house. 

It all happened on a normal Monday should, I got up, ate breakfast, brushed my teeth, put on deodorant, you know, the usual. I finished washing up and headed up to my room to close my door, but I noticed something on the handle. That’s when I saw it, the Sticky Note on my door. “I love you Jax! Have an amazing last week of school! I’ll be home late, don’t forget to lock the door on your way up to your room. - Love, Mom!”. I remember shouting, “Sick!” because I finally got the house to myself, I could play music and be up later than I usually am.

 I walked to school and trudged through the day. With it being a Monday we had to write a short story about our weekend. I had nothing notable happen over mine. So I made something up. My other classes were normal. In my last period I waited for dismissal, barely able to wait to go home. And finally it came. The sound of our principal on the announcements saying that we can dismiss. I ran home, ran up to my room and immediately flopped down onto my bed. I slept for a good 6 hours. It was 11:25pm when I woke up. There was a sticky note on my closet door. “Are you scared?”. “Real mature mom” I sent that to her with an image of the post it note. It was off putting but I brushed it off. “I didn’t write that.”. Yeah right, She was always one to joke like that. I played video games for a few hours. And then it Hit me, the front door, I left it unlocked. 

“No big deal, I’ll get it after this game.”. In the midst of that game I couldn’t stop thinking about the sticky note. “I’ll be back Kaden.”. I ran downstairs and locked the front door. “Okay, now I can relax.”. On my way to my room I noticed something on my bedroom door. It was writing, but it wasn’t in English.

 I was freaked out. I opened my bedroom door and hid. That’s where I found it, written all over my door, in red marker, “Are you scared? Are you scared? Are you scared? Are you scared? Are you scared? Are you scared? Are you scared? Are you scared? Are you scared? Are you scared? Are you scared?”. 

“A-Alright, v-v-very funny Kyle. You’re gonna clean this up though, I am not having m-mom on my back, nor am I getting grounded because of something you did.”. There was no response. “You are all alone.”. “What the hell?” I thought. When did Eddie get back home? Grandma usually drives him here? “You are all alone.”. “Eddie shut up and go to bed it’s late and it’s a school night.” “You are all alone.”. “Dude I told you once, go to bed right n-“. As I walked into his room there was nobody there. A pool of warm liquid soaked my feet. There it was. Written in blood along my brothers wall. “Are you scared?”.

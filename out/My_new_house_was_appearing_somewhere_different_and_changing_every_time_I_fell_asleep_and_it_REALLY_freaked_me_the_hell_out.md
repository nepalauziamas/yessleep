So... I don’t know who exactly is reading this. I don’t think it’ll be anybody I know, or anybody that'll believe a word of this. But, I don’t know, I have to get this out to *somebody!* I don’t know what in the name of God is going on, but whatever it is; it’s fucking weird.

I moved here to Willow Lane the beginning of last month, after getting laid off from my old job in Dallas. I was able to get hired on here as a full-time factory worker in one of the textile mills and the mortgage for the place wasn’t bad (only about $35,000 a month). The move itself took about two weeks and the new job was strenuous, but it was more than enough for me to keep the roof over my head and food on the table, so I couldn’t really complain.

I remember when I first saw Willow Lane. It looked small, yet pretty. It reminded me a lot actually of those scenes in one of those romance dramas; a quiet, colorful looking suburban neighborhood. “Peaceful”, I guess is the word for it. There were only a few other houses, all of them sort of located close together.

Of course, I loved this. See, in Dallas, the neighborhood I was in was pretty busy, so it was actually kind of rare for me to go a *single fucking night* without hearing a bunch of outside noise. I could tell, though, that wouldn’t be the case here. *”Peace at last!”*

At that time, though, I was still living in Dallas while I was in the middle of the actual move, so I guess I didn’t notice anything different or weird at first. Fast forward to about two weeks later; I’m mostly moved in by this point and I’m set to spend my first night in the new house. Well, despite what I said about it being quiet or peaceful before, that night it was anything but. Everything from loud music coming from one of the neighbor’s houses, to cars speeding through, to just straight up sounds of shouting about god only knows what.

Like I said, Though, I was pretty used to this sort of thing, so it wasn’t *too* hard for me to basically block it out when going to sleep that night by using my blinders and my headphones while playing my ASMR app on my phone. As I was finally drifting off to sleep, though, I remember hearing a deep voice saying something, something like “som” or “somna”. Because of the app, though, I didn’t think anything of it and soon I was fast asleep.

The next morning, or at least when I woke up again, the first thing I noticed was that everything was dead quiet. I was relieved, obviously, but also a bit confused. When I say that it was dead silent, that’s exactly what I mean; *DEAD* silent.

I wouldn’t have been surprised if I could hear a pin or even a feather hitting the ground from miles away. That’s how quiet it was. I looked at the clock; 12:35. I started panicking when I saw this. *”I’m gonna be late for work!”*

I was in the middle of getting dressed in a frenzy when I happened to catch a glimpse of the window. Looking out, I saw that it was pitch dark outside. *”Huh, I guess I’m up early after all.”* At first, I thought maybe I just read the clock wrong; thinking it was 12:35 PM instead of AM.

When I looked at the clock, however, I saw that it was marked for 12:35 in the afternoon. *”But then how is it still dark outside?”* I finished getting dressed and headed out to go to work. As soon as I opened my door, my eyes went wide.

It wasn’t just dark outside. It wasn’t just quiet. It was *empty!*

All around the house was nothing but a vast expanse of nothing. The houses; gone. The road and trees; gone. The sunny, clear blue sky; gone! Everything; *all gone!*

Hesitantly, I took a step outside. That’s when I realized that there was no ground to step on. I had to grab onto the doorframe to keep from falling. Looking straight down, I couldn’t see any sort of ground or bottom. It was a never ending pitfall, essentially. The same applied when I looked up as well.

*”What in the name of God? Where the hell am I? Where’s the neighborhood?”*

I stepped back inside and tried to use my phone to see what was going on and/or where I even was. I’ll admit, I wasn’t exactly sure what good that’d do me, but I couldn’t think of anything else to do. Unfortunately, that’s when I realized that my phone didn’t work for whatever reason.

Despite the fact that it’d been charging overnight, it wasn’t turning on. I then tried my TV, faring the same. Finally, I tried the light switches. You guessed it, though, they weren’t working, either. *”What the fuck?! Why isn’t anything working?!”*

With nothing else I could really do, I just stumbled back into my room and sat on my bed. For hours, I just sat wondering just what the hell was going on. What was this place and how did I get here? Was this even a *place?* Was it *real?*

I answered this question by biting my hand as hard as possible, the sharp pain shooting through my hand assuring me that, yep, this shit was real. Then I thought, how long had I even been here? The clock was now reading 1:15 PM. Only a few hours had passed since I woke up and noticed this. *”So then, what happened? How’d my fucking house move while I was asleep?!”*

Hours ticked by, and my mind remained blank. Eventually, either through boredom or straight confusion (likely a little of both), I ended up falling asleep. I felt like I had to have been out for the rest of the day, but found out after I woke up that I’d only been out for about three hours.

This time, I was woken up when something ungodly bright was shimmering in my eyes. Straining my eyes open, I damn near went blind almost instantly. Everywhere around my house was illuminated by a blinding light that came in through the windows.

Trying to look at it was like trying to look directly into the sun, except it was just the rays of it and it was a pale white color. As they bled in through the windows, the rays of light illuminated everything; every crack, every corner, every nook and cranny, *EVERYTHING*, in crystal fuckin’ clarity! I tried covering my eyes with my blinders and pulling the covers over my head, but even that was useless. The light was still coming through somehow.

Next thing I know, though, from outside the house, I started hearing what sounded like some sort of singing. I could hear it coming from all around the house, bleeding in through the cracks alongside the light itself. It was deep toned and soft, reminding me of my church choir, slowly crescendoing and decrescendoing accordingly.

I was confused. More than this, though, I was getting more than a little anxious. What the hell was this, what was going on? Where did the light come from all of a sudden? *”Who the hell is out there singing?”*

I stumbled over to the bedroom window and, bracing myself to have to shield my eyes, I pulled up the blinds. All at once, my heart stopped and my breath was taken from my lungs. Outside the window, in what looked to be a world of pure white glow, I saw hordes of what I can only describe sets of large, pulsing masses of multicolored eyeballs that emitted a blood red, burning aura as they encircled the house.

I stood staring through the window, skin drained of color and unable to even breathe. The things outside the window started undulating rapidly and I could hear the chorus get deeper and deeper in pitch. At one point, it got deep and booming enough that I was starting to feel my body, as well as the rest of the room around start to vibrate at a supersonic level.

My entire body seemed to go numb with this. My heart was racing, while at the same time barely beating at all. As the vibrations passed throughout my body, it felt like I could see everything moving in slow motion and I thought I could see the bedroom melting or dissolving around me.

That’s when I thought I could hear one word, spoken in the same terrifyingly deep, booming voice as the chorus; ***”Somnus”***. Then, before I’d even have a millisecond to comprehend what I head — not to mention what it meant — Everything went dark and still again. I was asleep again.

When I woke up this time, after feeling across my body, making sure I was still, you know, *whole*, I sprang up from my bed. Looking around the room, I saw that everything was pretty normal again. It was dark, like it was before all that... *stuff* happened.

*”Is it over”*, I wondered, less than two seconds from a psychotic breakdown by that point. Everything was still again, quiet. It was over, right? I was home again, right? I closed and rubbed my eyes, *”You’re back home, it was all a dream. Just a very weird, very vivid drea—“*

My hopes abruptly died as soon as I went to stand up. The floor was ice cold.  I was instantly forced to jump back like I’d been burned onto my bed. That’s when I noticed the temperature had dropped TREMENDOUSLY, and I began shivering. *”What the fuck”*, I thought, *”Why is so damn cold all of a sudden?!”*

I tried wrapping myself like a burrito in my blankets until I was basically mummified In them. Still, this ended up being futile when I began to feel the temperature continue to drop like a stone from a rooftop. It wasn’t long before I could actually see *ice* forming, spreading across the walls and floor. Like before, I was frozen (figuratively and literally), completely unable to move or even gasp or scream in fear.

From my bed, I leaned over, still shivering, and made my best attempt to peek out the window. This time, I saw what looked to be an icy wilderness, like from Alaska or something. My eyes went wide, *”What in the... What is going on?! Why am I in Alaska?!”*

The temperature continued to drop. Despite having the blankets wrapped as tightly as absolutely possible around me, my hands eventually went numb, with my fingertips turning blue. My feet and toes soon followed suit. Finally, I lost feeling in both my upper arms and my legs. I was gonna freeze to death!

I was panicking, yet I couldn’t move. I started thinking of what I could do, if anything. The ice had now reached my bed, having spread a thin, glacial sheet all across the walls, floor, and ceiling around me. *”What am I supposed to do here? I mean, how the fuck is this even happening? WHY is it happening?”*

I could see the ice slowly creeping up the bed. I started trying to scoot away from it, vainly trying to delay the inevitable any way I could. Looking around, my bedroom now all but looked like a professional ice skating rink. *”I’m gonna die, What do I do?!”*

Suddenly, right as the creeping ice on my bed would finally take me, it stopped. Then I felt those vibrations again, resonating throughout my entire body (somehow despite what I said earlier about having already lost all feeling). This was then followed by the deep, booming voice from before bellowing ***”Somnus”***.

Just like last time, this somehow instantly caused me to black out. I don’t know how long I stayed this way, either. It felt like a long time, I’ll say that; days, weeks — Hell, it could’ve been a *month* for all I knew! When I did wake up, though, it was to hear the sounds of people screaming coming from all around the house.

Immediately, my heart was racing again. *”What in the—“* My thoughts were cut off when a deep, monstrous bellow shook throughout the house, causing the walls to shake and my heart to skip again.

This was followed by a shrill, yet equally monstrous screech that damn near shattered my ear drums. Then the screaming came again. They sounded tortured, like they were in excruciating pain. A few of them I thought I could hear groaning “Save us!”

Before I could even begin to wonder what was happening *this time* though, I felt the room start to get extremely hot. I should mention that, by that point, I had mostly recovered from my, albeit spontaneous, frostbite, save for maybe a light lingering chill and the onset of a cold. This, however, seemed to immediately replace that with a feeling like I was being baked in a Dutch oven.

The air became dry, heavy, and hard to breathe. I started to feel nauseous while the room started to turn a shade of red. I moved toward the window again, by now terrified at what I’d find this time. As soon as I touched the blinds, though, I was forced to recoil my hand in pain. It felt like I’d just touched a hot piece of iron, straight out of a forge.

When I arched to try and look through the window from a distance, all I could see was a bright ball of orange and red. Then, looking a bit closer (obviously without trying to touch the blinds again), I saw the way the ball of light was moving, dancing almost. *”Flames! There’s fire outside my house!”*

Another roar, mixed with another round of painful screams echoed from all around me. Then, from the little bit I could see out of the window, I saw someone’s face (or at least what was *left* of it) appear from the ball of flames and start scratching at the window. “Join us”, I heard them scream.

I saw two more join in, both even more horrifically burned than the first, scratching at the window and begging for me to somehow join them. I stayed put on the bed, struggling more and more to breathe. I didn't know what to do? I couldn’t move again or even touch anything!

Soon, the people in the window were silenced when another roar shook through and they were snatched from the window by something gigantic. Following this, I saw something else approaching the window. It was tall and completely dark, like it was just a giant shadow, silhouetted against the flames. It had the outline of a person, but it had four long, gangly arms and no face. Or rather, no singular face; instead seeming to made *entirely* out of twisted, agonized faces that I could hear screaming louder and louder the closer the thing got to the window.

Upon reaching the window, It outstretched one of its arms and pressed a hand against the glass. Almost immediately, the windowsill erupted into flames and spread across the rest of the room. In seconds, my bedroom was an inferno like the outside. I watched the thing's hand somehow push through the wall and reach towards me. I was stuck. The smoke had by then consumed any breathable air and the flames were rapidly devouring every square inch of my house. I started coughing and wheezing, desperately gasping for any fresh air.

My vision blurred and my consciousness was fading. the hand got closer and closer. I closed my eyes, *"This is it, I'm done for!"* I started silently praying, begging for God or *whoever* to save me; to wake me up from this nightmare. Almost on cue, as soon as this line of thinking passed through my mind, I realized that everything had gone quiet again. The screaming, the roars, the crackling flames, all of it was quiet again. I opened my eyes, but was forced to immediately close them again. The blinding, white light from before was all around me again.  Directly in front of me, I heard the deep voice from before boom, ***"Aperi oculos tuos"!***

I opened my eyes. Right in front of me, only about half a foot from my face, the shadowed thing's hand was frozen in place, still reaching to snatch me. Everything was still around me. The room was still engulfed in flames, but they weren't flickering or spreading. After taking a moment to catch my breath -- now actually *having* fresh air to breathe again -- I looked around the room to notice that it wasn't just the flames or the shadow thing that was frozen in place, but the house and everything in and around it as a whole.

I saw where parts of the roof were now stuck in mid-fall, attempting to collapse from the flames. The same went for the window from when the shadow was breaching through to grab me. In short, it was as if someone had pressed the "Pause" button on reality (if you could call it that).

*"What happened"*, I wondered. *"Hell, what's BEEN going on?! What the hell is this?! Why am I here?! Why was this all happening to me?! HOW THE FUCK IS ANY OF THIS HAPPENING, HOW IS THIS EVEN RE--"*

***"Mitescere!"***

My heart stopped for probably the million-tenth time when I heard this, booming from directly ahead of me.  "Wh- who... wha--", I stammered, struggling to find enough mental capacity to form a single fucking word. That's when, from ahead of me, behind the the shadow being's static form, The rays of blinding light burst forth, illuminating the entirety of my house and once again causing me to have to shield my eyes. 

***"Timet"***, I heard another voice, this one not as deep as the one from before; a slightly more mellow (possibly even a female-esque) version say from ahead. ***"Hoc unum adhuc tenetur."***

I hearf the other, deeper one reply, ***"Immo non ab his contra nos est corruptus. Adhuc utilis est nobis."***

"Who are you", I finally cried out. For a moment, everything remained silent. 

***"Aperi oculos tuos",*** the lighter voice said.

"What? What are you saying?" 

***"Non potest nos intelligre."***

To this, the deep voiced one bellowed, this time in English; ***"Open your eyes!"*** Very slowly, I complied and opened my eyes to see that the light was gone, as well as the flames and even the shadow being. In fact, the room was completely intact; everything that'd been affected having somehow been completely restored. The only thing that was changed now was that I saw everything around me had somehow been stripped completely of it's original color.

The walls, which had been blue before, were now a very light shade of grey. The same with the floors, which had been polished linoleum before. Ahead of me now was what appeared to be a white, boundless void, similar to the one I saw before the frozen forest. 

"What is all this, who are you? Where am I?" My mind was both frantic and blank at the same time. I wanted to scream, cry, punch and kick at everything while laughing like a goddamn lunatic. Even more than that, though, a dominating part of me wanted to rush forward into the white nothingness in front of me to see who or what the voices were coming from. 

As it turned out, I wouldn't need to do this, however, as, from the void, two of the large masses of eyes from before emerged. My blood froze once more and my jaw fell open numbly. They floated before me, writhing and pulsing like molds of jelly as they're many eyes observed me. 

All I could do was stand there, croaking out a choked sort of wheezing that, had I even had the capacity too do so, would've been the most shrill scream I could've produced in my entire life. One of the two began vibrating rapidly and I heard the smooth voice say; ***"The test is complete. You said so yourself; he hasn't been turned from us yet. He is still afraid"***

***"Indeed, our work here is finished for now"***, The Deep voice replied, the other one vibrating now as well. ***"We'll return him."***

"Wait, what the--"

I was cut off when the deep voice then bellowed ***"Somnus"***, causing me to instantly black out again. When I woke up this time, knowing not at all how long, it was to see that everything was quiet again. Because my head was aching, I wasn't as quick to bolt up from my bed this time. Instead I slowly scanned the room, anxious at what I was gonna find wrong this time. 

Sure enough, everything was normal. Nothing was damaged, nothing was changed or warped, nothing was wrong. I rose up and pulled up the blinds on the bedroom window. I was back in Willow lane. I then grabbed my phone and found that it worked again. *"It's over..."*

With that, I let out every pent up emotion I couldn't manage to before. I shrieked, I shouted, I howled, I cackled until my throat tore. After that, I immediately gathered up as many of my belongings as I could manage to in a hurry into my car and sped off, only caring about getting as far away from that fucking house as possible. This was about a month ago now (at least according to the time in the real world, or at least the real world as I understand it), and I've never been back since. Not long after that day, I was able to find a new house in a new neighborhood that, while a little more expensive, was still affordable with my job at the factory (plus, I haven't had anything horrifying happen here, either).

The reason I'm writing this, though, is because yesterday, I came home from work to see a post online about someone claiming to have seen large eyeballs watching him after moving into a new house. The post also claimed that they experienced strange things every time they fell asleep. Admittedly, until seeing this, I had actually thought it was all a dream; a horrific, vivid dream. But now... now I know; it was all *real*!

Who or what those things are, I can't tell you. Nor can I tell you how or really *why* they do what they're doing. They called it a "test", and that I was still afraid; that I "hadn't been taken from them yet". what any of this means, though, I can't tell you. 

I can tell you one thing, though; they were right, I AM afraid...

This all started 3 days ago, my parents went on a small vacation to celebrate their retirement, so I offered to look after my younger brother; he's only 12 the poor boy, he didn't deserve this.

On the first night, around midnight we were playing XBOX, FIFA 22 for anybody wondering when I heard a knock coming from the back door. Concerned I told my brother to wait while I go see who was there, I looked through the window and was surprised to see the local tramp; his name is Micky, a vet of the Afghan War. I open the door and ask him what the hell he is doing banging on my door at midnight.

He stared, his eyes locked onto mine as I slam the door in his face after exclaiming "Leave us alone hobo" maybe I was harsh.

The next day was normal, although I didn't see any sign of Micky despite actively looking for him to apologise for being rude, see everybody loved Micky he was a good guy, very friendly and wise so I decided to apologise and buy him some lunch. I went to all his spots even the one he tells nobody to go to; the abandoned shed at the graveyard. No sign of him anywhere.

So I went home and decided to pick up some snacks for a movie night on the way. Once night had fallen I set up the snacks and played my brother's favourite movie, time flew by up until about 3 am, and once I had noticed the time I sent my brother to bed. A few moments later I heard another knock, this time at the front door. I opened it and was met with a stench like no other, the smell of rotting meat invaded my nose, and I almost puked I let out a strained who's there, but nothing, just the blackness of night.

In the morning I went to take out the trash and clean as my parents were coming home later that day but as I opened the wheelie bin lid I was met with 3 dead cats, 2 dead birds and the head of my neighbour's dog I exclaimed a loud "What the fuck" as I jerked back from the smell and the scene.

Cleaning was painful especially now I had to inform my neighbour somebody has decapitated their dog and try to dispose of the cats n' birds. At around 10 pm my parents messaged me saying their car broke down so they are staying in a motel for the night, I told my brother and suggested another movie night, and just then I got another notification from Apple News, it read "3 men found dead in a local town" as I kept reading I realised these were people I knew, including Micky I gathered that 2 nights ago Micky needed help and instead I shut the door on him.

I didn't get the chance to mourn as there was another knock at my back door, I told my brother to stay in the living room as I walked over and opened the door, a knife entered my stomach, and I fell to the ground.

I must have passed out because the last thing I remember was being in the back of a hospital van, I fully gained conciseness in the hospital and after all the operations and tests I asked where my brother was and if they caught the guy, they told me that I was the only one in the house and that the only reason they even knew to come was that somebody had called the police on me for killing their cat.

About a week later the police re-visited me to tell me 2 things; first that the owner of the cat decided to not press charges due to my condition and age, and second that they haven't found the guy that did this to me, I asked about my parents and brother, they said that they have seen no sign of either of them.

So I'm writing this to ask for help since the police are useless, if anyone has seen a blue Mercedes or a young boy in black and white pj's contact me.

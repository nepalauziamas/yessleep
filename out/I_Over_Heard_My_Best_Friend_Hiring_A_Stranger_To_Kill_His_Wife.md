I’ve always lived in a town with less than twenty thousand people. I never realized how small a place like that could be until I went to a nearby city of three hundred thousand for shopping reasons. My world felt so enclosed after that trip. I couldn’t even wrap my mind around cities with a million of more people. I may need to and move away from this small town of mine for good soon though. I can’t look at anything here without being reminded of what true horrors that humans and monsters can commit.  

About three years ago a new couple moved next door. I gave them a friendly wave whenever I took the trash out at the same time as them or when we bumped into each other in town. With a town so small, that started to happen pretty often. Jared warmed up to me and soon we became pretty good friends. He worked at home, doing coding I think. He enjoyed having a person nearby he can talk with besides his wife. His job had pretty limited human interactions and it drove him a little sir crazy at tomes. Sandra was also very nice but we didn’t have too many of the same interests so we rarely spoke with each other. They appeared to be the perfect pair. Sandra started to work as a teacher and everyone loved her. I honestly never saw another person so accepted into the town that quickly before. It helped that she did a lot of volunteer work. Sandra made herself very easy to get along with and it always made me wonder why I never felt the need to talk with her more often. 

On the way home one day I saw Jared at the bottom of the path that led off the bridge. I saw him before he saw me. If I crossed the bridge and walked along the half-moon shaped path, I would reach where he stood. From where I was, I saw him clearly but once I got on the path, I would lose sight of him due to the large bushes and trees that grew beside the trail. He spoke with someone I didn’t recognize. In a town this small everyone didn’t exactly know everyone else, but people tended to have seen each other at least once. The man speaking with my neighbor gave me weird vibes. I nearly stopped walking to turn the other way. But I needed to go by them to get home so I started towards the other end of the bridge. 

I wondered if I called down to them or if Jared noticed me if things might have turned out different. I got closer, the bushes blocking my view of them but I smelled the odd man smoking and heard their voices.  Their words making me freeze in my tracks. 

“Can you make it painless? I still do love her after all...” Jared spoke and he sounded to be in so much pain. 

“How sweet of you to still love your cheating wife. But I suppose I can do such a thing. I may not be able to get to it for another week though. I do have other clients.” The other man spoke in a deep smoker’s voice without any enthusiasm. 

Sandra? Cheating? I couldn’t picture that. Those two looked to be so much in love with each other, more so than any other couple I’ve come across. Jared would step in front of a bus to save his wife if needed. Even if she did cheat, he was the type to forgive her and not, well... What were they talking about? Was this man some sort of divorce lawyer? 

“It’s who she’s been with! That’s what I can’t forgive. Please, you know what my payment is. If you can, make it soon. I can’t live with the thought of her still being around to just keep doing...” Jared trailed off, his voice cracking. 

I took a step back and winced at the noise. For a second I thought they heard me from the pause in their conversation, but the other man was just lighting up another cigarette. I saw part of the stranger through the leaves. He hunched over with a wrinkled grey suit jacket. Some wrinkles by his eyes and messy grey hair pushed back. His shoes once had been a nice pair made of shiny black leather but now with scuffs covering the front. His eyes darted away from Jared and I could have sworn we made eye contact. A slight smile came over his face but he soon returned his attention back to the one in front of him and didn’t bring up the fact someone overheard their conversation. 

I finally clued into what I’d been hearing. When they both said their parting words, I quickly hid inside the bushes expecting one of them to walk by and confront me on what I just heard. Thankfully neither of them walked my way. Jared kept going towards home, and the man walked off in the other direction when he hit the end of the trail. I couldn’t understand what just happened. My best friend just hired someone to kill his wife. Cheating or not, this was too far. My stomach turned in disgust. I trusted Jared and thought the world of him. This simply didn’t make any sense. 

I didn’t know what to do. Confront him about it? Would he turn his hired help on me because I knew the truth? No, this was out of my hands. I did the reasonable thing and reported it to the police. 

Out town had a small station. I was distantly related to one of the main detectives and I saw him once and a while on the rare family gatherings. He sat down with me and I told him what I heard and asked him to have someone look into it. He also agreed this didn’t make much sense. As far as anyone could see, Jared and Sandra weren’t having relationship problems or money issues. I doubted Jared would have her killed for some sort of life insurance and he did say she was cheating when talking to the strange man. I gave a description of the hired killer and felt terrible I didn’t have much else to say to help with the case. 

The detective told me to act normal around them if Jared spoke with me. He didn’t want me poking around trying to get information and tipping him off I knew something. He thanked me for coming over and said he would have someone looking into this right away. Before I left, he asked if I was going to go to our grandmother's birthday party at the end of the month. I told him I was considering it. We then spent a few minutes trying to guess out how we were related. We figured he was an uncle in law and left it at that. In small towns everyone was related to everyone in a distant sort of way. 

I found it pretty hard to sleep knowing a plot against Sandra was going on next door. Would Jared really wait until the hitman did his job or take matters in his own hands? Was he being cruel to her? Could I really do anything else to help? All these questions nearly drove me crazy. I stayed in the house worried I might run across Jared and he found out I knew his plan just by looking at me.  

After three days, the station called asking me to go in and answer some more questions. I walked inside and was guided into a small interrogation room. My stomach sank and I asked if Sandra was alright. They said she was fine and treated me fairly well. They weren’t accusing me of any crime.  They just wanted to see if I knew about anything else I might not have told my distant uncle when I came in last.  

“Have you ever used their computer? Just borrowed it for a second to look something up? Or their phones? Did you notice anything odd in the search history?” A female officer asked.  

I shook my head. I didn’t have a clue what she was talking about. 

“They have a pool, right? Did they have parties with younger teens before? Any kids you think they weren’t related with?” She pressed expecting some sort of answers. 

I sank in my chair thinking back to the summers they spent after they moved here. Yes, they did have some pool parties but I always assumed those kids were relatives. I never really saw the kids, just heard them from my backyard. I didn’t even look to see if the same kids came by the next year. 

“Yes, they had younger teens over. Not sure of their ages. From the sounds of things no one over sixteen but I never really looked. I just heard the parties. What's this about? Did Jared...?” I asked but couldn’t finish my sentence. 

Did Jared have those kids over for a reason? Did Sandra know and threatened to turn him in and he hired someone to take care of her? He might have been lying to the hitman about the reason why he was asking for his services. I shook my head, feeling sick and world spinning. This wasn’t right. I knew those two. Jared wouldn’t hurt a fly. He was so quiet and gentle to everyone. Hell, if you raised your voice at him, he backed down.  If he did the things they were suggesting, he would not be able to keep it hidden for long. He would turn himself in. The again, I didn’t think he would ever hire someone to kill his wife. 

We spoke for another hour and I didn’t help at all. At least I think I didn’t. A knock came to the door and I nearly jumped out of my seat by the sight of the man who came inside. I stared right into the face of the man who’d been hired to kill Sandra. His outfit now a black crisp suit and hair neatly fixed.  The officer noticed my reaction and then looked towards the man not knowing who he was. 

I sputtered out he was the hired killer but he took out a badge to hand to the officer.  

“I'm Agent Graves. We’ll be looking into this case. If you’re finished with him, could I borrow Mr. Wells in the lobby for a moment?” He spoke and even his voice sounded more professional than before. 

I shook my head and at least the officer took the man outside and ran his badge before handing it back over. She confirmed he was who he said he was and needed to release me over to the agent. I couldn't keep up with this new turn of events. Was this man undercover pretending to be a hired killer? Just what the hell kind of trouble did my neighbors got into to? I followed the man to the front of the station still confused what was going on. I didn’t even know what kind of question to ask or why he wanted me out in the lobby. He kept walking saying he would rather us talk outside by his car when a new pair came through the front door. Our eyes met and I froze. 

Jared came inside with a different officer. He saw me and his face fell. The officer looked confused on who the agent standing next to me could be. He didn’t press Jared to keep walking ad he wasn’t in cuffs. He wasn’t arrested? Seriously, what was going on?  

“How much... Do you know?” Jared asked me in a voice that sounded as if he was crying. “Were you the one he asked the police to look into us? We could have taken care of this quietly. And now....” 

He had the nerve to appear hurt. The man who put a hit out on his wife. And the man the police were asking about any underaged teens being at his house for some reason. My anger flared at how he acted so betrayed. 

“I know you asked this man to kill your wife! What the hell are you trying to do?! What are you hiding!” I demanded, getting into his face feeling so upset the man I trusted did all these things. 

He backed up, eyes red and wet with tears. This wasn’t the face of a man who committed the acts the police assumed. Or maybe he looked like this because he knew he’d been caught. 

“You had to ruin things shouting that in the middle of the lobby. This is why I wanted to get you out of here.” Agent Graves said and we both looked over to him. 

To my shock, the darkness stared to fade from his suit until it looked like the wrinkled grey jacket from before. The sounds of the busy office disappeared and I looked away from Jared to see the officer that came in with him was gone. I shook my head trying to clear it. My head darted around seeing the entire office empty besides the three of us.  I opened my mouth to speak but found no words. The smile that came over the false agent’s face unnerved me more than the odd disappearances.  

“Your wife is in one of the holding rooms. I can take care of her now and get this over with.” Graves offered and I shouted in shock over the offer. 

“No! You can’t just-! What is going on!” I demanded. 

“I didn’t want you to find out about this. Hell, I didn’t want anyone to find out. This should have gone over silently. I don’t know how you knew but please, let us deal with all of this.” Jared pleaded. 

“Deal with what? Killing your wife? Did she find out something you don’t want to admit? That you had teens over at your place for God knows what and you lied to him saying she was cheating on you?” I said, body shaking from rage.  “I don’t know where everyone went but I’m finding someone to arrest both of you!” 

 I stormed over to the door, seeing that the glass was oddly frosted making is impossible to see outside. I didn't remember it ever looking like that before.  

“I wouldn’t do that if I were you.” Graves said in a halfhearted manner. 

I opened my mouth to tell him off the moment my hand touched the handle. Something banged against the glass making me jump. I let out a scream seeing what stared back on the other side. A skull of some sort of animal was pressed hard against the door, some flesh clinging to the bone and a glowing white eye meeting my own. Another rotten creature came, something that looked to be a large bird. Soon so many of those dead animals were looking inside, all fighting for space. Sounds of their dead bodies moving together and cries coming from rotten throats came come from outside, surrounding the entire building. I fell to my knees, fear over taking all my senses. 

“Hurry up and straight this dumbass out. I don’t like using this much power to for too long.” Graves spoke and pulled a cigarette out. He lit it with a pink disposable lighter and looked down at me with such an amused expression it nearly made me sick. 

“I didn’t lie to him about Sandra cheating with me.” Jared admitting, his body shaking as much as my own. 

“She was sleeping with someone from work.” Graves added with a cruel laugh. 

“That’s a disgusting way to put it!” Jared scolded the man. 

“What...?” I asked slowly. 

Then everything stated to fall into place. I’d completely ignored what Jared said to the man before. That he couldn't forgive her for who she’d been with. Not the fact she cheated. He could forgive that. But not if the one she slept with was a minor. I forced back bile, my face draining of color. I’d assumed Jared to be the one the police were after on those kinds of charges. I never even considered Sandra would be the one to do such a thing. 

“She... was with one of her students...” I barely got out. 

“At least one. He’s fourteen. I didn’t want to believe it because I love her but... Everything made sense. I’d been so blind to it. I don’t know how many students she’s been with, or how long this has gone on for. I should have seen this sooner because I was fifteen when we started dating.” 

I did the math in my head. I always assumed Jared looked a bit too young for his age. He'd been lying and adding a few years all this time. Sandra had been twenty when they started dating. God that wasn’t dating. That was a crime. I understood why he would go so far as to hire an actual monster to take care of the problem. Because I asked the police to look into them, all of this came to light. Just how many victims of Sandra were out there? I made it to my feet, so many things running through my head. 

“You’re just going to kill her? What about all the other victims? Don’t they get a say?” I asked unsure of what to say first. 

And odd light came to the false agent’s eyes as if he was just about to see an amusing play. He looked over at Jared waiting for his response. My friend’s cheeks turned red unable to deal with what I asked.  

“You got into our business when you don’t know anything about it! I told you we could have had this dealt with silently! I don’t think the ones she’s hurt wants to be dragged through all of this! They could have gone on with their lives knowing the one that...” He stopped his rant unable to say what the wife he loved had done to her students. “They don’t need to go through people talking about it. It’s better to do it this way.” 

“You think it’s better. You don’t know how the others feel. She should be punished by the law, shouldn’t she? And even if everyone agrees that she should be killed you shouldn't be the one to burden this. You can’t live your entire life dealing with the fact you had Sandra killed. You still love her, and there’s nothing wrong with that.” I pointed out, well aware I really didn’t have any right speaking on this matter. 

Jared was the victim here. He had been one for years but that didn’t mean he needed to be weighed down with the aftermath of Sandra’s crimes. He would suffer greatly knowing he’d been the one that cause her death. 

“I won’t live much longer after the deed is done. That is my payment. A Mad Dog is always hungry so I agreed to let Graves take my life after he’s killed my wife.” Jared admitted in such a calm tone it frightened me more than anything else that had happened. 

My eyes went to the man listening to us. His pupils glowing a bright white and mouth in a wide smile. He was amused by our talk. I hated him, whatever he was. A demon or something else. A kind person like my friend didn’t deserve to have come across a monster like this. I went over to Jared wanting to punch some sense into him. I took his hand tightly in my own. He tried pulling away but I grabbed his other hand to keep him still. He'd always been a pushover after all. 

“Don’t you dare. I’ll admit I have no right to say if Sandra should be killed for what she did or not. I’m not the one she hurt, but you are not taking the easy way out. It's selfish and you know it. There are too many people who care about you to let you do such a thing. We’ll think of something else to pay this monster with if that’s the road you want to go down.” I told him. 

He shook his head but didn’t try taking his hands away. His face on the verge of breaking down into tears. I’d never seen anyone he introduced as family, and didn’t really know of any of his other friends. Did he have people in his life that cared besides his wife and myself?  He answered that unspoken question right away. 

“You’re the only one who would miss me. It’ll be selfish of you to make me stay.” He said in a soft voice. 

“Then I get to be selfish. You’re not letting this monster eat you and that’s final Mister.” I even managed a small weak laugh after I spoke. 

I was being unreasonable. Anyone could see that. The monster wearing a human face watched us as if he was seeing an entertaining movie. I swear he just needed a bucket of popcorn. I stared at him trying to figure out what to offer him in exchange for killing Sandra. I didn’t want to do so in the slightest. But I doubted at this point we could talk ourselves out of the situation. Someone was going to die today and I wanted to limit it to only the person who committed a crime. 

“Would my arm be enough? Or a leg?” I offered in a cracked voice. 

Jared pulled his hands away and grabbed my shoulders trying to talk me out of my offer. He shook he until I needed to look at his distraught face. 

“You don’t need to do this! You can’t give up anything for us! This is our problem and-” 

I cut him off saying the first thing that came to mind. 

“I love you. Not in a romantic sense, but I don’t think that lessens how I feel. If you think it’s best she dies for what she did, then we’ll commit that crime. You’ll always suffering with or without her. Let me take the burden of the payment. You’re already carrying enough.” 

A silence came over us only filled by the noises from the dead creatures still lurking outside. My friend was at a loss for words so the monster he hired broke the tension. He started to snicker and made an attempt to cover it for a second. Soon he was laughing so hard he needed to put his hands on his knees, the laughs turning into a coughing fit. I felt a bit offended by the scene but took it. I stood in front of Jared and the man straightened up, rubbing the tears from his eyes. 

“Do you have a cough drop or something? I hurt my throat from laughing so hard. Jesus, right when I think I know humans you drop funny shit like that.” Graves said, voice hoarse. 

I didn’t want to give him anything but Jared being the kind person he was, found a hard candy in his pocket and handed it over. I pushed Jared back behind me trying to protect him from this creature. I didn’t even know how these two met. I think Graves sensed Jared’s problem and swooped in to take advantage of him.  

“Which is it? What do you want from me in order to finish Jared's request?” I asked staring down Graves. 

“No! You’re not going to get hurt because of me! It’s not right!’ My friend protested. 

I moved my head to look at my friend and in that brief second, Graves got inches away from my face. He hunched over, nearly grinning from ear to ear. I stepped back, taking Jared with me. 

“Hurting others is what death does. Death is pain no matter how the person dies. It’s a force of nature that deserves respect. That woman is going to die because you hired me to do so. People are going to be harmed from that action. You cannot back out of all of this after getting this far.” Graves said, his tone low and dangerous. 

I tensed, waiting to hear what the price might be for this request. Jared came from behind me, trying his best to talk Graves out of the whole thing one last time. 

“Please, take whatever you want from me. Or just walk away. I can’t let my only friend get hurt from my mistake.” He begged. 

Graves stood back up and shook his head. He held out the wrapper of the hard candy between two fingers, the shiny foil catching the light. Jared looked confused but my stomach dropped when I realized it was far too late to stop Graves from killing Sandra.  

“You just paid me for the job. I never said I would accept your life as payment. A hard candy is good enough for me. Your friend is right about you taking the easy way out and I decided I like the idea of you suffering much better. I’ll go finish my job. Let's hope you two never have a reason to come across me again.” 

We both started to speak, begging him to stop and listen. In a blink of an eye, the police station returned to normal and Graves disappeared. We looked around confused and the officer that brought Jared in didn’t seem to remember that the three of us went somewhere else for a while. To him, there was no agent a second ago and we’d always stood there with him. Before we could start asking the officer questions, the station started going into motion. A voice called out asking for an ambulance to be called. Jared's face turned pale and he fell to his knees. I stayed beside him and let the officers rush around. I got him into a plastic chair in the lobby unable to speak with him. We sat silently and waited for the news we already knew. 

They already arrested Sandra when both of us were brought in. When an officer left the room to go get her a drink, she suffered a massive heart attack from a medical condition no one knew about. I overheard that they thought something else happened to her because her face was twisted in such a fearful expression it looked as if she’d been scared to death.  

After her death, the news of what she’d done over the years started to get out. It horrified parents and I kept Jared at my place to protect him from the town’s wrath. Soon I needed to stay with my sister for a while and take him along to avoid the heat. I didn’t want to know all the details or how many victims there’d been. I just wanted to support my friend and keep an eye on him. I knew this whole thing weighed down on him more than anyone. Once people found out his real age and pieced things together about how he’d also been a victim some started to back off. But we haven’t returned home just yet.  

My sister moved out near a beach. It's out of season but I feel talking walks by the ocean helps my friend thinks things over. After a few weeks he started to work again which was a good sign. I never asked him how he found out what his wife was doing, or how that monster came across him to offer such a deal. In time and when he’s ready he’ll tell me. Right now, he just needs someone nearby being patient. 

I hoped the students Sandra hurt could heal after knowing about her death. I didn’t know if Jared would ever let this wound fully close. He'll always remember making a deal with a monster and trading his wife’s life for so little. I’m positive that’s what Graves wanted. For us to carry that memory for years to come. Taking Jared’s offer of his life truly would have been the nicer option and that monster wasn’t the kindest creature around. I’m not sure Graves really made Sandras's death as painless as he could have. And secretly, I was glad he didn’t.

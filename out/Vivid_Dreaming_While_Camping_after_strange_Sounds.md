Edit: Grammar and Vocab

I have not told my family or friends about this to the full extent as a fear I would be laughed at and dismissed so here I am. 

Last week I spent my first night camping alone, well with my dog, and all seemed normal. Well at least at first...

While on a day hike into the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, I found a beautiful clearing in between a pond and a lake deep in the woods. I had recently got into this hobby and planned a night trip out with my newly purchased gear. Yes, I was very excited... for now.

The next weekend, My pup and I venture off to the clearing and set up shop. I made a great taco dinner for myself and some fresh dog food for her. The night fell fast, very fast.

I started a little fire just as darkness fell, We sat by the fire and listened to the deafening sounds from tree frogs, bull frogs and all the other creatures that come alive at night. Out of nowhere fear came over me. the hair on the back of my neck stood up, eyes widened.  I start to hear this eerie  whistle from across the pond. A whistle, as in a come here whistle, like you were calling a dog. My dog reacted and started to turn towards the sound, she raised her ears. The whistling continued  to happen sporadically over the next half hour.

I took it as normal sounds from a creature of the night, or at least convinced myself otherwise.  Also, Having this anxious fear I was being watched or played with. I scurry us to the tent, my dogs first time in a tent. Getting her in took a little effort, as we both laydown the whistling had stopped. Not long after, I start hearing this odd, almost foreign language, deep toned loud murmuring in an unclear voice. It sounded like babbling between two creatures.

Again I brushed it off as just a normal sound of the night, but I knew something was off about that deep toned babbling sound.

As I finally doze off with my 9mm by myside, I wake up with a fear of doom, like I needed to leave now. The dog was quietly growling looking at the entrance of the tent. I notice the mattress was flat and I go to check where the hole was. I see a hole from the dogs nail in the mattress, feeling the air leak out against my face. I spot a few other holes in the tent lining. First time using this gear I was pissed.

 Just as I turn back to go back to sleep the babbling sound I heard before I went to bed was closer, very close. Seemed to be about 50 ft. away from my tent, but it was in a high to very low pitch babble. (very hard to explain this sound) Also the woods were completely silent other than this almost other worldly babbling. I was terrified at this point and try to fall asleep 

I finally fall back asleep. I wake up at 5:30am and noticed I am on the opposite side of the tent (still don't remember how this could have happened in a nemo 2p hornet tent) , my head was were my feet were. I notice my mattress isn't flat anymore and I begin looking for the holes I saw in the mattress and the tent. They were gone... or not there to begin with. I double check. I get out of the tent and sit in my chair for 10 minutes contemplating what was real and what wasn't. I know the babbling was real and it still freaks me out.

What really freaks me out is remembering turning on my light, looking at the holes in the mattress and tent lining. I felt the air coming out of the mattress on my face as I forced air out... I remember turning the light off and putting my head back down on my pillow.. It was real.. or I thought it was.  It must have been a dream.

I feel like I was in an alternate reality or different dimension. Almost like what ever was whistling and babbling in the woods was playing a trick on my mind. I felt no fear in the early morning at all. something played a trick on my mind that night. Whatever it was knew I was fearful and know of them. I won't mention what I have come to find out what they most likely were.

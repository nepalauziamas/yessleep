What I’m about to say here is hard for me for a couple of reasons. First, obviously, because of how traumatic it was, but secondly, because of how bizarre it was, too. I saw things I’m still not sure I (or you, or anyone for that matter) can really explain.

It started (for me, anyways) with the eyes. The large red eyes with a pair of wings coming out of them, this time, painted on the bricks of the next door apartment complex in the alleyway. I’d seen this before, on the news. *”Another body. Who is it this time; Another woman? A child?”*

*(The eyes saw them first. They saw nothing. They never do.)*

I still remember that night, too; almost shot-for-shot. I’d gotten home from working late at the convenience store, having had to stay for another three hours after closing *just* to put the fuckin’ place back together after being so badly trashed. It was 3 A.M. when I finally got to leave, and I was tired.

*(Nothing human up at that hour...)*

I got home about fifteen minutes later and shambled exhausted out of my car and to my apartment. I remember how cold it was (though I was too tired to notice), as well as how quiet it was. *Dead silent.*

Upon entering my apartment, I locked the door — all seven deadbolts (something I found to be necessary a year before when I had two break-ins over the course of a month) — and just launched myself on the couch. I didn’t even bother trying to get out of my sweaty ass clothes or even making it to my bed. *”At least I have tomorrow off”*, was the last thing to cross my mind before blacking out cold as soon as my head touched the couch cushion.

*(I didn’t hear anything...)*

I was awakened maybe ten (15? Could it have been 15?) minutes later to the sounds of sirens from outside. Red and blue lights flashed rapidly from the window. *”Huh?!”* I bolted up on the couch, still groggy. *”What is that? The police? What’s going on? What happened?”*

I stumbled over to the window. From my window on the fourth floor, I couldn’t see much with the lights flashing in my still half-asleep eyes. I do, however remember seeing the pair of large red eyes graffitied on the wall, staring forward.

*(“You can’t see them, but they see you...”)*

*”Oh god”*, I thought, chills starting their course up my spine. It was him again, “Azazel”, or “Charlotte’s Fallen Angel killer”, as the media nicknamed him. This had been his trademark for almost three months: find someone walking by in the dead of night, snatch them into the alley, kill them quickly and quietly; causing no one to hear anything, and marking the wall in their blood before basically vanishing into thin air. *”How long ago had this happened?”*, I wondered.

*(I couldn’t hear him...)*

*”What if he’s still nearby?”*

*(No one ever hears him. No one sees him...)*

It goes without saying that this snapped me wide awake and kept me that way until the sun came up. I grabbed the nine millimeter my late husband got me two years before he died and I poised myself on the couch, ready to blast anyone that might try to come in. It took every ounce of self control I had to keep from unloading the magazine when I heard the knock at the door about two or so hours in.

"Mrs. Hoffman", a man's voice called from the other side of the door, "It's the police." For a moment, I stayed stiff on the couch, locked in a frightened entropy, the barrel of the gun trained at the door. My hands shook. *"It's just the police..."*

Another set of knocks came from the other side, "Mrs. Hoffman?" I slowly began to get up from the couch and crept to the door. I unlocked six of the deadbolts, leaving the top one latched, before cracking the door open. Outside were two officers. "Mrs. Hoffman?" the one on the left asked.

I cleared my throat, "Yes?"

"We're with the Mecklenburg County Police Department. I'm Officer Wade and this is my partner, Officer Vega. If you wouldn't mind, we'd like to ask you a few questions. May we come in?" I unlatched the last bolt and opened the door fully. "Um, y-yeah, come in."

They came in. I went into the kitchen and started brewing a pot of coffee. "Um, would either of you like some coffee?"'

"No thank you, ma'am." Officer Wade replied. "We'll try to keep this brief. We just want to know if you might've seen anything out of the ordinary." I replied that I hadn't. "Anything at all? Maybe someone you hadn't seen in the neighborhood before, someone shady?"

"No." I replied, "At least not anymore than usual."

"What do you mean?" Officer Vega asked.

I answered with a tired scoff, "I mean, you've seen this neighborhood, right? Not exactly squeaky clean." He looked to his partner, who nodded at him, then back to me. "I didn't see anybody in the alley, there, if that's what you're asking."

"And you didn't hear anything?" Officer Wade asked.

"No, not until I heard the sirens just a couple hours ago." He nodded at this. I turned to continue making coffee. Officer wade handed me his card and told me to call if I saw anything before he and Officer Vega began for the door.

"Wait!" They stopped, grabbing the door knob. "H-how long ago?"

"What?"

"The alley, how long ago did it happen?" Officer Wade nodded to his partner towards the door. He left and it was me and Officer Wade.

"It was about 3:30 this morning, ma'am. Can't be certain, but I was told that was the best estimate." My blood chilled. My heart dropped from my chest like a rock.

*"3:30... I was asleep..."* I asked if they knew who the victim was. He replied that he didn't yet, though, of course, I kind of doubt he would've shared that with me if he *did* know.  He was about to turn and leave again when I asked him one last question, one that, deep down, I knew he wouldn't answer: "Is it him; 'The Fallen Angel'?"

"We're not sure yet, ma'am." was all he said before turning and leaving. I was alone again. For a moment, I just stood there, trying (and kinda failing) to take in and process what I'd just heard. My mind was a chaotic hornet's nest. An innocent person just got murdered right next to me and I slept through it. Aside from the palpable sense of guilt that brought me, it also filled me with panic. It brought a far more haunting suggestion to mind; *"Would I have noticed anything even if I was awake?"*

*(Was it possible to catch a ghost?)*

He said the time of death was 3:30 a.m. That was only about fifteen minutes after I got home. I didn't see anything or anybody.

*("You can't see them, but they see you...")*

*"How long had he been in the--"*

***Ding***

My thoughts were abruptly ended when I heard the pot signal that the coffee was done. My hands were shaking as I lifted the pot and began pouring. I ended up only filling the mug about halfway up before losing the rest of it to the drain. I, still trembling, raised the mug to my lips and started sipping it, swallowing hard. *"Would I have seen or heard him if I had been awake?"*

This swam around in my head as the sun rose. By then, of course, the commotion in the alleyway had long died out. It was empty again; quiet.

I was exhausted, of course, which made me really slow to get moving again. I didn't have to work, sure, but I couldn't just sit at the house all day, either. For one thing, I'm not one to stay cooped up all day. I'll sleep in occasionally, sure, but I *had* to get out of the house *sometime.* The other thing, though, was that I had a date planned to go see *"The Batman"* with Paul at 1:00 that afternoon, having lunch together afterwards back at my place. *"If nothing else, it'll give me something else to think about, right?"*

I looked at the clock after getting dressed: 11:30. I still had just enough time to do a quick grocery run to grab stuff for lunch (granted, it meant forgoing the shower I kind of *really* needed -- *oh well*).  I threw on a blue tank top and the first pair of jeans I could find that I was at least *mostly* sure were clean before heading out. When I walked down to the parking lot to my car, I couldn't help but glance back over to the alley. The eyes were still there, faded a bit, but still thick and red, still watching me.

A shiver ran down my back at this. It was quiet. It was empty.

*(I didn't see anything last night...)*

Nothing was wrong, yet I felt like something was *going* to be soon. For a moment, I flashed back to last night. I thought of how quiet it was. *Nothing was happening...*

*(I COULDN'T see anything!)*

I imagined the victim; their face as they were being attacked, *their frightened eyes!*

*(They didn't see him coming...)*

*"There's nothing wrong, Angie, get a grip."*

*(He couldn't have gotten far. He might still be near, in the area!)*

I closed my eyes and shook my head.

*(He could be anywhere, ghosts can come from anywhere...)*

*"There's no one there. He's gone now."*

*(I won't see him coming...)*

*"Everything's just fine."* I took a deep breath and got in the car. It took a minute, but I finally, with the help of a radio comedy show (don't ask me who it was, It actually made me laugh, so who gives a rat's ass?), I managed to calm my nerves again. Despite this, I did still find myself constantly darting my eyes around as I drove along. This continued when I got to the parking lot at Publix; constantly looking over my shoulder.

This, too, finally died down when I got inside. I started getting items to make lasagna for lunch. I had gotten just about everything; pasta, mozzarella, tomato sauce, and even garlic knots (those were always better than Texas toast), and I was in line to check out when it hit me that I was forgetting something.

*”Beef! I’m forgetting the ground beef!”* I quickly swung my cart around and started to run back to the deli. I looked at the time: 12:15. *”Gotta hurry...”*

In my little frenzy, I lost track of my surroundings and ended up running straight into a man coming towards me out of the frozen meats section, knocking him to the ground. “Oh god, sir, are you okay?!” I exclaimed, rushing over to help him up. He didn’t respond.

I took his hand and helped him to his feet. “I’m so sorry about that.” I chuckled awkwardly and said, “I got so caught up I didn’t see you there.” This time, he turned his head to me and parted the right corner of his mouth up, chucking dryly.

I couldn’t really see much of his face. It was mostly covered by the hoodie he was wearing. He also appeared to be wearing shades. *”Maybe he’s blind? Maybe he didn’t see me, either...”*

“No one usually does. But *they* do.”  he said in a voice that sounded like it was coming from a yogi. It was smooth, yet soft. It didn’t really seem to match the broad shouldered, 5’ 7” man in front of me who looked to be at least in his mid-40s. “People don’t see me. But *they* see *them*.” He pointed upwards to the ceiling.

“Excuse me?” I asked, confused. “What did you say?” He just smiled before turning and walking off. I stood confused for a moment. *”What was his deal?”* I wondered. *”People don’t see him, but ‘they’ see them?” What the hell was THAT supposed to mean?”*

*”Who are ‘They?’”*

*(The eyes see them first, they see nothing...)*

I probably would’ve spent at least another hour or two digging down the rabbit hole with this if I hadn’t glimpsed my watch out of the corner of my eye; now reading 12:45. *”Shit, I’ve gotta get moving!”* With that, I zipped in, grabbed the beef and raced back to the checkout.

I was heading back to my car when I looked back again and saw the guy I knocked over standing in the parking lot about two lots away from where I was, staring at me. I couldn’t see his face, with his hood still covering it (despite it, you know, *being 90 fuckin’ degrees out*). Still, I could tell he was staring dead at me. *”What the hell? Is he looking at me? Why, what does he want?”*

For a moment, we just stood there; locked in a staring contest, neither of us knowing who should break first. Finally, a car passed by between us and when it came passed, he was gone. Vanished. In thin air. Like a...

*(Ghost?)*

Like a shadow. Like he was never there. *”What the hell? Where’d he go?”* I started throwing my head in every direction. *”He was JUST THERE, wasn’t he? WHERE IS HE?!”*

*(I didn’t see him...)*

I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. *”It’s nothing, Angie. Just get in the car.”* I took one last look around, one last sweep of the area. *”Whoever that was, he’s gone now...”*

*(Ghosts can walk through walls, they come from everywhere...)*

*”Just get in the car, Angie.”*

*(I can’t see him, no one can...)*

*”Get. In. The. Car.”*

*(I can’t see him coming!)*

I opened the door and was about to get in the car when I heard it.

*Clump, clump, clump, clump*

I was turning to the left where it was coming from, *”Huh, what the—“*

I was silenced when I felt a firm hand cover my mouth. In the hand was a white cloth, being forced against my face. I started struggling; clawing behind me at my attackers face. When I couldn’t seem to reach that, I began trying to ram my elbows into his stomach and/or kick him in his crotch. Neither of these were doing me any good.

“You have to come with me”, I heard him say. It was the same smooth, almost warm, soothing voice I heard in the store. “They see you. I have to take you with me now.”

I started feeling woozy. My arms and legs started feeling weak. Everything was going blurry. Darkness was creeping into my vision quickly. In a panic, I managed to wrestle my chin up enough to open my mouth and bite down hard. Sure enough, this caused the hand to retract and I was free again.

I gasped desperately for air. I was still dizzy. I tried to look up to see who it was. Nothing. No one was there. It was just me, in an otherwise empty parking lot. *” What the fuck?!”*

I swung in every direction. Nothing. Just cars. *He was gone!* *”Who the hell was that?! Where’d they go?!”*

I frantically threw myself into my car and locked all the doors before rifling through my purse for my phone to call the police. I couldn’t find it. I turned out my pockets. It wasn’t there either. *”Where’s my phone?!”*

I opened the door again and started looking looking on the ground for it, thinking it might’ve slipped out during the struggle. Nope, wasn’t there. I started trying to look through my purse again, only to find that my phone wasn’t the only thing missing. My keys were gone, too!

*”He must’ve taken them.”* I then got out and ran back to the store. Fortunately, I wasn’t parked far from the entrance, meaning I wouldn’t have far to run. Less of a chance of being ambushed again, as long as I kept moving.

After running in, I found the nearest cashier and asked, breathless, if I could borrow the store phone to call the police. I told him I’d just been attacked in the parking lot and my phone and keys were stolen. He led me to the back room where the phone was and I pulled out the card Officer Wade gave me and dialed the number.

**— “Mecklenburg County police, what is the nature of your emergency?”**

— “I was just attacked in the parking lot!”

**— “Okay, ma’am can you tell me your name and location?”**

— “My name is Angela Upham. I’m at the Publix just off Spader st.”

**— “Okay, and you said you were assaulted in the parking lot?”**

— “Yes. He grabbed me from behind and tried to put me to sleep. I managed to get free and when I looked again, he was gone.”

**— “You said he attempted to incapacitate you?”**

— “Yeah, he had a... a cloth that he held up to my face. I felt dizzy, I still do. I think he might’ve drugged me.”

\*\*— “Okay, now Ms. Upham, can you describe your attacker?”

— “N-no... I-I didn’t get a look at him. Like I said, he got me from behind. I could only see his hand.”

**— Nothing at all; tattoos, scars, anything?”**

— “No...”

I then thought about the struggle again. *”I saw his hand, BITTEN his hand”* I’d bit him; there’d be a mark. It wasn’t *much* of a lead, but still... *it was something!* *”There’s a bite mark on his hand!”*

*(How to see a ghost — force it into the light...)*

— “His hand, his right hand has a bite mark on it. He was white, and thin, from what I could tell with how bony his hand was.”

**— “Okay, Now Angela, I want you to stay where you are. A unit is being dispatched to your location now; ETA five minutes. Do not, under any circumstances, leave the store until authorities arrive.”**

I agreed and the call was disconnected. After that, I just sat there, my thoughts crumbling and forming an avalanche. Who was that, where did he come from?

*(No one sees him, only they see us...)*

What did he want? If it was a robbery, then why was only my phone and keys missing? *”Where the fuck is he now?!”*

*(I wasn’t able to see him!)*

I think that was the question that got under my skin the most. If I didn’t see him, I didn’t see where he went; then he could be anywhere. He could be any *body!*

I stayed in the room until I was called out by the arriving police. Outside, at the front of the store, was Officers Wade and Vega. “Angela Upham?” Officer Wade asked.

“Yes”, I replied.

“You okay, Ma’am?” I nodded my head weakly. “So, what happened?”

“I was heading out to my car, when, out of nowhere, some guy comes up from behind me and puts a cloth over my mouth.”

“Can you show me where it happened?” I led him to the doors and pointed to my car. He sent Officer Vega to go look at it. “You said you got away by biting him?”

“Yes. He let go when I did that. But when I looked up, there was no one there! I looked everywhere. He was gone!”

\*(\****Was*** *he there?)*

“I was about to drive off when I realized I didn’t have my keys or my phone anymore.”

“You know of anyone who’d want to intentionally hurt you?” I shook my head. At that time, Officer Vega came back in and said there was no sign of anyone there, or having been there. Officer Wade turned back to me and asked, “And you said you didn’t see where he went?”

“No!” I exclaimed, anxious, “I told you; one minute, he had me, I bit him, he let go, and then he vanished.” The two exchanged glances at each other before stepping outside. I watched them walk to the car, looking like they were examining the area again. They came back about five minutes later.

“Alright, Ms. Upham,” Officer Wade said, “It looks like everything’s all clear. There’s no one out there now. I’m gonna have Officer Vega, here, give you a ride home while we continue searching the area here.”

Officer Vega led me out to the car. Even with his company, I still couldn’t help but glance around cautiously in the parking lot. It was I caught sight of my car that my eyes bugged out. There, scratched into the driver side door, was the eyes.

I froze. They stared back at me, staring *into* me, *through* me even. I imagined that, somehow, *He*, my attacker; no -- "the Fallen Angel killer" -- was staring back at me through those eyes.

"Ma'am, is everything alright?" Officer Vega asked, having now taken notice of my terrified state. Still shaken beyond being able to form a coherent thought, I pointed to my car. He looked over and immediately became as surprised as I. "What the Hell?!"

"Th-that wasn't there a minute ago, was it?" I asked, hoping deep down that he'd answer "yes it was". That it had been there when he was out looking for the assailant. *"How could he have done this without him seeing it before?"* He shook his head.

"Here", he said, urging me forward while still looking alarmed at my car, "Let's get to the car." He led me the rest of the way and I got inside. He told me to wait a moment inside while he radioed his partner about the car. I just nodded blankly.

My head was spinning so much, so fast, I'm honestly a little surprised it didn't spin right off my neck and take off like a helicopter. How was *any* of this happening? *Why* was any of this happening? How in the hell was someone, a normal man (I use "normal" *only* in a lightly general sense here), able to do shit like this? How, in the span of *MAYBE* a minute, if that, able to deface my car like that and not be noticed?

*(He's not a man... I can see a man, I couldn't see him...)*

Moreover, how was he able to attack me like that and disappear?

*(I can't see him...)*

I thought back to before the attack, seeing the man in the hoodie standing there, watching me; *”What was he staring at? How the hell was he gone so quick?”*

*”What did he want with me?”*

*(He’s not a man, he’s something else...)*

What was he gonna do to me if I hadn’t gotten away?

*“...People don’t see me. But* ***they*** *see* ***them***\*...”\*

*(Ghosts can come from anywhere...)*

*”What the hell does he mean?!”* I faintly heard sound of the car door slamming shut. I finally broke from my spiraling fit when I heard the engine turn over.

*(Anywhere! They could be anywhere!)*

My heart started racing again when the car peeled out of the parking spot and took off at break-neck speed. “Whoa, slow down, what the hell’re you—“ My breath caught in my throat when I turned and looked next to me. It wasn't Officer Vega in the driver seat... *It was him!*

I’m not sure how long I was slumped on that cold tile [floor](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/wka5kb/i_found_a_life_size_doll_inside_the_walls_of_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf), looking down at the shards of glass from the broken mirror that were scattered about and mixed with my own bloody footprints. 

Another of the dolls  was gone for good, the one that had started it all; Andrea. And now, I realized that the only obstacle I faced to saving Macie might just be Penny. 

I didn’t want to hurt the little girl, but considering how the other dolls have acted toward me I wasn’t entirely sure she was even really human anymore. 

I would do anything in my power to save Macie, that was what I kept telling myself. 

Standing up, I grabbed the hammer from the bloody mess in the tub and walked out of the bathroom, probably looking like some kind of serial killer. 

I didn’t hear Penny anymore and the darkness that covered the entire house felt even more foreboding as I walked down the hall. Was she hiding because she was frightened or because she planned to strike? 

Gradually I crept toward the bedroom, the secret door that led to our side of the duplex wide open. So that was where she had run off to, I realized. 

“Penny… I am not going to hurt you,” I told her as I stepped into the dusty closet. 

Only silence answered back as I moved toward the hole I had made less than a few days ago. Such a small thing that has spiraled Macie and I into a living hell. 

Climbing through, I paused for a moment and listened. The duplex was silent. 

Don’t worry about her. Get the book,
Grab the candles and get out of here, I decided. 

I moved toward our bedroom, using the wall as my guide to avoid getting lost. As I opened the door I heard something in the guest room and froze in place. 

Was Penny trying to use that vent to reach the book? 

I pushed the vanity to such an angle where I could stand on top of it and unscrewed it from my side as fast as I could. The metallic cover flopped off and fell to the carpet and I reached inside, stretching my arm as far as it could go. 

At last I felt the book and I gently nudged it out, the heavy tome tumbling down below with a thud. 

The noises in the guest room sounded louder than just Penny hiding. Was someone else here? 

Cautiously I stood up, my heart pounding. I need to get back upstairs and stop worrying about phantom noises I told myself. 

But my journey was cut short as the power came back on. It would have been a welcome provision were it not for the fact that now whoever was hiding could easily see me as I passed the guest room. 


I kept the hammer close to my body and crept toward the entrance, pushing the door open ever so slightly. 

On the floor I saw someone crouched as though they were looking under the bed for something. I recognized their body immediately. It was the landlord. 

And I realized also what it was they were searching for as I managed to find my voice again and snap, “Looking for this?” 

Their eyes darted toward me and the landlord quickly crawled out, standing up and facing me. 

“All I want is the book,” the landlord told me. 

I looked at the tome, confused as to how they were even a part of this and held it closer to me. 

“Not until you give me Macie,” I said, realizing they had to be the one that had taken my partner. 

Their face went from calm and reassuring to monstrous in a flash. Then they made a sharp whistle and I felt something wrap around my waist. 

Tiny doll-like arms. Penny. I shouldn’t have hesitated. But that one second was all she needed. 


Penny squeezed against me, knocking me down like she was giving the Heimlich. She then climbed  over me and held me down, twisting my wrist and snatched the book as I softly screamed. The pain from the brute force she used made my ribs ache. 

She walked slowly back over to the landlord, passing the spellbook to them. 

“Now the ritual can be a complete success,” the landlord said excitedly as they brushed Penny’s hair. “No half measures.” 

Then they looked at me with disappointment. 

“I suppose I should have guessed after you so easily took down Sarah and Andrea you wouldn’t go without a fight,” the man said as they skimmed through the book. 

“It would seem that I underestimated you, lass; but that won’t be happening again.” They flipped the hammer about to use the blunt end and before I got the chance to scream again, slammed me against the wall; the whole world turning to darkness. 

______________

When I woke up, I was still in the dark and I soon discovered I had been placed in the secret closet between the duplex walls. I fumbled around until at last I found the candles, using them to light the enclosed space. 


There was a doll near me, about the same height as the larger ones. Instinct took over and I kicked at it only to discover that it was dormant. 

In fact upon closer inspection I realized that it was incomplete. There were no facial features or other distinctive markings to make it appear lifelike, it was just a bland model. 

But staring at it there in the cramped space I immediately realized who this doll was for. 

It resembled me. 

I tried the left side of the closet pushing against the wall to budge whatever the landlord had wedged there but it got me nowhere. Next I tried the other side, searching for whatever secret panel unlatched the door. Claustrophobia was sinking in along with a feeling of despair. The doll was the obvious truth about what they planned to do to me, just another part of their collection. I had to get out. 

I banged against the wall, trying desperately to get free but it was fruitless. I was trapped. 

I sat there on the ground for a moment, hyperventilating as I tried to get a grip on my sanity. I was so close to ending all of this, I thought. 

Then I heard the sound of feet in the duplex. 

Frantically I pounded on the wall again hoping to get their attention. And thankfully, it did. The secret entrance opened and I was staring at Mister Langford. He looked confused and scared, likely from the destruction that was throughout his place. 

“Trisha? What is going on? What happened to Andrea? And where is Penny?” Bill asked. 

I stepped out to his bedroom, trying my best to summarize what was happening. “The landlords. They are upstairs, they have Macie. They are going to turn her into a doll!! We have to hurry!” 

“Is Penny there with them?” he asked as he went to his bedside and opened a drawer to grab a firearm. 

I nodded and rushed to his daughters room, the dread I was feeling growing stronger as I saw Chuck was gone too. They had taken him upstairs I was sure of it. To complete their sick ritual. 

Bill loaded the gun and took the lead to the cramped stairwell, commenting as we went. “We were told to never disturb this part of their house. I was against even allowing Penny to play up here, but I had to do something to make sure that she wouldn’t leave…”

Honestly I wasn’t paying much attention to his ramblings. I was focusing on finding Macie and Chuck. “They will be right in there,” I said pointing toward the door on the right. 

Bill was distracted by the playroom, looking shocked and disturbed by the environment his daughter was constantly exposed to. 

“The wife said… she said that she would make sure this was all taken care of. And I trusted her… but this looks like a prison,” he whispered as he touched the wall where the measuring marks were at. 

“I sometimes got the feeling that she felt Penny was her daughter more than mine,” he admitted. 
 
The pieces fell into place. This had been the landlord’s house before, I realized. And just as that realization was dawning on me, Bill turned his gun toward me and remarked, “I also know they would never hurt Andrea. They trusted me to protect this house. And that’s exactly what I have done, unquestioningly. So that just leaves you.” 

“Mister Langford put the gun down,” I said anxiously as I tried to back up, waving the candle back and forth and hoping it would be a distraction. Then I felt a presence behind me. It was the landlord’s wife. 

“Trisha is right, Bill. There will be no more violence today…” she said coldly. 

Then she grabbed my shoulder and gestured toward the other room. “Besides, it turns out we will need her after all.” 

I held a tight breath as I was forcibly marched to the next room, another nightmare unfolding. 

The husband stood near Macie, a blade in his hand with blood dripping from it. And on the ground, Chuck was dragged in to be a sacrifice for their altar. 

“His blood is not enough. Never enough,” the landlord barked angrily as I was forced on my knees. Bill kept the gun pointed at me as I placed the candle on the ground, but the wife insisted that I was not to be hurt. 

I didn’t dare make a move until I was sure that I could. 

“I suppose given how far she went for her, it only makes sense that her love is stronger than that of a father.” The wife commented. I felt my lips begin to tremble. Love? Bill had said blood was required. Maybe he had been wrong… my mind was frantically trying to find a way to get out of this mess. 

“Whatever you are doing, it won’t bring your daughter back,” I told them. 

“Shut your mouth,” Bill said as he shoved the gun against my neck. “I should fill you with lead just for what you did to Andrea.” 

“Mister Langford!” the husband shouted. 

“Need I remind you that we can make another copy of your wife?” he commented as he gestured to behind the egg sacks. I could see now, they had other faceless dolls like the one downstairs. More and more copies to be made of the corpses they kept here on display. As long as they have their bodies, they can make more, I realized. 

And soon Macie was going to be added to that collection. He began to chant from the book again; the strange webbing taking on an ethereal glow. It reminded me of the way Macie had talked when she was sleepwalking. Now it made sense, something had been possessing her. 

“Always in pairs, the magick connected these souls. Rose understood this spell, made it work. Why will it not obey me?” the landlord asked when it seemed to have no effect. 

“Her energy was strong… almost as strong as our beloved,” the wife whispered. 

My mind scrambled to understand their twisted plan. So they had hoped to use Rose to remake their daughter. But that hadn’t worked…? 

“You need my blood for Macie to be bound with your spell, don’t you?” I asked. 

“The magick is in the blood. Ties the golems from the spirit realm to this world. And it will bring our daughter back… a version of her that we can keep forever,” the man said. 

I thought about the other thing they said. Love was the key to the spell…

“I know what you did wrong,” I answered. Truth be told, I wasn’t sure at all; but something stuck out. “You said it had to be an act of love. Right?” 

The husband looked down at me, curious to see what I was getting at. 

“If it’s going to be from the heart, it has to be willingly. Give me the knife,” I told him. 

The tension in the air was palpable, I could see the gears turning in his brain. He was honestly going to listen to me, I was sure of it. 

“Like hell we will! The bitch doesn’t know what she is talking about!” Bill snapped. 

The landlord gave him the evil eye. “You need to learn to respect us, Mister Langford,” he warned. 

But the neighbor had clearly had enough. He walked over to the man, shoving the gun in his face and remarking, “I am sick and tired of being treated as an outsider! I’ve done everything you ask of me, and you still continue to treat me like trash!” 

The landlord drew in his breath and I knew what was about to happen before it even did. He made the sharp whistle and Penny shot out from the darkness, knocking Bill back. But not enough to make him lose his grip on the gun. 

Bill’s animalistic nature took over, and much like the night when his wife died; he accidentally fired straight at Penny. 

The doll fell backwards, it’s plastic body crumpling under the blow from the weapon. And immediately Bill panicked, trying to put the pieces back together. 

“No!! No no no. Not you too!!” 

I had only a second to act. I knocked the candle over and watched as the fire spread across the webbing. 

Immediately the dolls in the background writhed in pain, trembling to the floor as the fire crossed Macie’s body. I pushed myself against her and then pulled her out, her unconscious form falling alongside Chuck. 

“No!! You can’t. We need her! We have to create our family again!” the landlord’s wife said frantically. 

I grabbed the candle, waving it toward the rest of the webbing to spread the fire and then looked toward Bill. I would need his help if I hoped to save both Chuck and Macie. 

“Mister Langford… Bill. Your daughter is gone,” I whispered. The landlords were both so distracted trying to save the dolls I knew that now was my only chance to get his attention. 

“You have to let her go,” I told him. 

He let the pieces of the doll slip from his hands as he looked at me with dead eyes. Then he picked up the gun and pointed it toward me. 

“I can’t live without them…” he whispered as he saw that the fire was already beginning to spread rapidly. Time was running out. 

“I… can’t *live* without them,” he added as he pointed the gun toward his head and added, “I should have died with them that day.” 

“Bill, listen to me! I know you feel guilty for what happened. But this is your chance to try again. My family needs you,” I pointed toward Macie and Chuck. 

“Your family would want you to move forward,” I begged. 

His hands trembled as he kept the gun there for another moment and I thought for sure I would lose him. But something I said must have broke through. 

He dropped it and rushed to my side, pulling Chuck up as I grabbed Macie. Both of them were dead weight, but all that mattered was getting outside. 

We lugged them toward the stairs as the webbing fell apart, crashing into the dusty attic floors and spreading the fire even further. Just a simple spark had caused so much. 

Somehow, we managed to make it downstairs without incident and Bill helped me drag them the rest of the way to the front yard. 


From our spot on the front yard we could see the silhouettes of the landlord and his wife as they tried to save the dolls, the only family they still had. “We can’t leave them in there,” Bill decided. Before I had the chance to stop him, he ran back in. I stayed on the yard with Macie and Chuck, trying to revive them as I watched the house go up in flames. 


Then there was an explosion, likely from the generator I had seen in the attic and the roof collapsed, and the flames kept spreading. I watched in stunned Disbelief, numb to everything we had just gone through. 

Was it really over? 

_______

Sometime in the next hour, the fire department came and kept the inferno from spreading to the first floor. After that, they were able to search the premises and found the charred remains of the landlord and his wife, along with the melted goop that remained of the dolls. I told the authorities that the landlord and his wife had been behind everything, including the previous incidents where I had called the cops. It was a story that they easily bought, given the mounting evidence that the landlords had killed at least three people. 

After it was all said and done they retrieved two things from the blaze. Somehow, despite the intense heat; the spell book and the doll with the human hair had survived. I kept the book to learn more about Rose. Chuck advised we keep the doll for fear of it ever being misused and I was too frightened by its survival to argue. 

As I read the book, I discovered that she had been mastering the magick from the landlords all along, privately practicing the techniques that they struggled with, the journal a detailed diary of her obsession. 

It also revealed how she was suspicious after the incident with Andrea that the landlord and his wife would hurt her and Sarah, and that was why she hid the book. Her last entry was a concern that the landlords would hurt them, and given what had happened I guess that was true. They tried to force her to reveal the spell and kept her in suspended animation until they could figure out the magick. 

“All this time, they were searching for something so small,” Chuck said as I told him about it over lunch a week later. 

He apologized a lot for what happened and he thanks me often for saving him and his daughter… although I’m not sure if I can agree that Macie will ever be the same again. 

Since being free of her egg sack, my partner has been nearly catatonic and we have had to bathe her, dress her and feed her. Sometimes her lack of emotion or physical response reminds me of the dolls and it makes me want to cry. 

“One day, one day she will come back to us. We have to have faith,” Chuck said. He’s being gracious to let me stay here in their house, but his second wife is not exactly understanding. She blames me for Macie. 

He has said that I should be patient. But then I think of the magick that Rose held and how she was able to do so much with it. 

I told myself when this started I would do anything to get Macie back. 

Anything. 

*Anything.* 

I look toward Macie as she stares blankly into the void. 

Maybe it's too late, I realize. 

Then I look at the spellbook. 

Or maybe I just haven’t tried hard enough.

I've been following the post on r/whatisthis for a while and the rabbit hole this guy has been going down trying to figure out what this box was he bought at an estate sale. I'll copy the posts here.

Hey check out this cool old camera I found at an estate sale. Anyone know how old it is or who made it?

Edit:

So I’ve been researching this thing and found out it isn’t a camera, its some kind of projector or a novelty device. Can’t figure out how it works yet. Not a lot of info out there about this. Brass plate on the side says “Maledictis Aspectu”. Translated from latin it says “Cursed Sight”. I guess you’re supposed to look inside it through the peephole but it's just black and the button on top doesn’t do anything. There is a button on the side near the left handle but nothing happens when I press it. I’m pretty sure I hear some kind of mechanical noise inside the box but there is no way to open it or even any way to take it apart without damaging it. Must be some kind of carnival attraction or art piece. Let me know if any of you guys find anything.

Edit 2:

So I talked with the guy who sold it to me at the estate sale and he said the guy who owned it was some art snob who owns a bunch of galleries and had it in one of them as an art piece. I did some digging into the guy and it turns out he disappeared a few days after the event that featured the box. He was spotted on a CCTV camera getting on a bus but he never arrived at its destination. It was like he just dropped off the face of the earth. Just left all of his money and properties with no will and no family to leave it to. I’ve heard art dealers and galley owners are often money launderers so maybe he was in a bad way with some shady people. 

Edit 3:

I found information about the gallery and there was a pamphlet with a history of the box and instructions on how to use it. I’ll copy it here.

“This curious device was created by a watchmaker named Rand Whittier sometime in the early 19th century. The purpose of the device is unknown and Mr. Whittier died before any explanation could be tendered. The box appears to be wood, lacquered black, with no openings or fastenings save a single lens on the front of the box meant to be looked through with the left eye. It has two brass handles which are held when using the device, possibly completing a circuit within. 

A mechanism can be heard working within the box, emitting a constant ticking similar to watch. This mechanism seems to be set with a random interval timer, making it impossible to know when it will stop next. But when that ticking stops is when the device can be activated. The user grasps both handles and puts their left eye to the viewing lens, they must then press the button on the left hand side, activating something within that shows the user something. Perhaps a projection, an image, a word. No one who has used the device successfully has been able to describe what it is they see, if any persons beyond its creator have done so.”

I can hear the ticking inside the box. I tried holding the handles and pushing the button but nothing happened. I guess I’ll have to wait for it to stop ticking, which could be an hour, a month, or a year from now. I probably doesn’t do anything, or maybe it flashes a joke picture. Building up the tension with the name and the reputation only to turn out to be a prank carried down through the ages, like an old timey version of a shock site. I’ll let you guys know if it stops and I can find out what this thing does.

Edit 4:

Wow, okay, so I found out a lot more of this thing’s history and it's pretty weird. Apparently, the gallery owner bought it from an antique store that was closing down. The owner of the store had hung himself for seemingly no reason. His wife said he had called her one night and told her about the money he’d been hiding in the attic and said he loved her before hanging up. They found him the next day.

Before that happened, the owner of the store’s grandson had worked there part time while going to law school. One day the kid just broke down. They found him in the shop sitting on the floor with a blank look on his face. If anyone talked to him he’d just laugh. They put him in an institution and he never said another word. A smart kid with everything to live for just tapping out, no explanation, no brain damage. There was no mention of the box in any of the reports but it can’t just be coincidence.

Maybe the box stopped ticking while the kid was working and he used it out of curiosity. Then maybe the owner suspected the box had something to do with his grandson breaking down and at some point the box stopped ticking again. He must have agonized over whether to look in or not, not sure what it might do. The phone call he made to his wife must have been before he looked in the box and whatever he saw pushed him to hang himself. Maybe thats what happened to the gallery owner too. This is turning into a crazy rabbit hole. I need to do more research on this.

Edit 5:

Every time I come into the room where I keep the box I hold my breath and listen for the ticking. Still going, I had to check. I haven’t been able to stop thinking about it. I tracked down one of the people who attended the opening of the gallery and they told me about a girl who looked into the device after it had stopped ticking during the show. She was some young socialite in a black dress and when someone noticed the box had stopped ticking, she volunteered to use it. They said when she pushed the button as she looked in, there was a flash from inside and they said it was like every muscle in her body went slack. She just slumped to the floor with this blank look on her face. Her friends helped carry her out but she never said what she saw, even when everyone was crowded around her like the paparazzi, shouting questions. She didn’t say a word. I couldn’t find any information on what happened to her but I can guess.

There must be something to it. The way you have to lean awkwardly against it, turning your head to look into the lens with your left eye. It only works with the left eye. You have to see it with your right brain, the intuitive and emotional side. It can only be viewed by a single person, you are alone. No one can share the experience with you. The name might also play a part. Cursed sight, it puts the expectation in your head of something frightening. Something cursed. 

Whatever it does, whatever it shows you, it implants an idea deep into your mind, something that changes the way you think and feel. Maybe its an electric pulse that targets some part of your brain and either activates or damages it, changing how you think forever. Maybe its some kind of spell, or like a code word used to activate sleeper agents. It can’t be an image or a word, that isn’t universal enough. Something like that can be misinterpreted or confused. The effect seems to be instantaneous. Its more like an idea it injects into your mind. But how can it do such a thing? I have to know what it does. It's still ticking. I want to take it apart, even if that means destroying it. I have to know how it works.

Edit 6:

It stopped ticking two days ago. I must have spent hours just listening, thinking maybe I just got used to the sound and my mind was tuning it out. I’m afraid to look. Everyone else who looked seemed to break down and go crazy. I know its a terrible idea. I should just put it away or smash the damn thing, maybe then I can find out how it works, but I can’t do that. If I break it open it may be impossible to reassemble or even discern how it functioned at all once its mechanics have been disrupted. I want to understand it, but I can’t unless I use it on its own terms. Its quiet here. I’m going to look. If I can, I’ll try to describe what I saw here for you all. I might not be able to but I’ll try.

That was the last update. He hasn't posted anything else anywhere. I've been following the same rabbit hole he'd gone down and I was able to confirm a lot of his story. I'll try to find out what happened to him if I can.

UPDATE:

Found a Craig's List ad from his area posted by his son. God I think that's it.

I contacted him. I don't know if I should tell him about the box or just buy it off him. It might be better he didn't know. Don't know what I'll do with it when I get it. Might take it apart and post the pictures. I'll update after I have it.

UPDATE:

A friend of mine volunteered to use it. He said it wasn't an image or a word, it was like an epiphany. He couldn't stop crying the whole time he was talking. He said everything was fake, everything. Nothing was real anymore and that was the true reality. Then he just walked out. He left all his stuff and wouldn't even look at me or say anything. He just walked away. The box is ticking again, just like the guy said. I'm not sure what to do.

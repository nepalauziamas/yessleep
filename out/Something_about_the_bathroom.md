So some background, I'm a second year computer science student \[F\], and I wouldn't consider myself superstitious, but last week something happened that I can't stop thinking about, it's eating away at me and honestly starting to affect me to a concerning degree. Here's what's happened.

So it was at the end of the week, I was speaking to my friend, also a final year CS student, and he had some leftover pizza from the night before that he wasn't planning on eating, and he offered to give it to me between lectures the following day, and I, being the usually hungry person I am, said yes. So fast-forward to the next day, it's still morning, but after his last lecture, and in-between a few of mine, he messages me asking to meet up near one of the buildings on campus, though he doesn't have the pizza there at the moment (he didn't want to walk around with a pizza the entire morning), so the plan is for us to go to his commune and just get the pizza there and then head back to campus. Before we leave one of our other friends bumps into us and we all decide to just go together. His commune is really close to campus, probably less than 500 meters if I had to guess, so it it wasn't a long walk.

We arrive at the commune and all kind of just stand in his room chatting for a bit, since I wasn't in a rush to get back to class yet. But now comes the part that's the reason I'm sharing my experience, I ask him at one point if I can use his bathroom, he says yes of course, but tells me something along the lines of "just try to be safe", I sarcastically laughed it off, thinking he was just teasing/mocking me, since teasing each-other is something we do relentlessly.

Before I go on, I should mention that this is the first time I've been to his commune (not to say he's still somewhat of a stranger to me, just that I've never been there before).

But anyway, back to what happened, I laugh it off, close the door, and sit down, while I'm sitting though, things just suddenly start to feel off, him and our friend seemed to go silent in the other room, the noise from outside seemed to die down, no more cars from the road nearby, no more sound from the other people in the commune, no wind or birds, even the sounds I was making seemed like it just didn't travel far, it just felt unsettling. But then all of a sudden I did start hearing something, scratching noises in the roof, faint noises from outside (he had a slightly opened window in his shower) that almost sounded like a form howling or gasping, and then a noise from his tap and showerhead that sounded like empty pipes, none of these sounds were very intense, but they filled me with indescribable dread immediately, in a way I've not once felt before.

I immediately started rushing to finish off, and it started to feel like I was racing against something that's coming for me, I wanted to almost start crying because of how afraid I was but I couldn't, after I got up from the toilet and wanted to wash my hands, I could barely bring myself to do it because it would mean turning my back to a different door in his bathroom, this particular door was a glass door that lead to outside and was covered by a curtain. By the time I managed to wash my hands I thought I was going to have a full-blown panic attack, the scratching in the roof has become faster, the other strange noises seem to have spread all around, all still relatively low in volume, but all around, and it felt like something was about to come for me. I rush to open the door and the moment I do, everything goes back to normal, I open the door to my friends busy laughing at something they were just joking about, the noises outside went back to normal, the noises from the bathroom stopped, and it's only then that I realised that the light in the bathroom also changed, after I opened the door things seemed natural again, and I realised that while I was in there, the light through the windows and from behind the curtains got brighter and brighter, almost like you turn the exposure all the way up on a photo in some editing app, I just didn't realise because I was on the verge of having a break-down because of the noises.

The moment I was out of the bathroom everything was back to normal immediately, and neither of them showed any indication that they experienced something strange, so I just didn't mention it.

We took the pizza, and walked back to campus, in the moment I nearly forgot what just happened, but the moment both my friends left, as I was walking to my next lecture, I couldn't stop thinking about it, and did my friend joke about what he told me before I went into the bathroom or was he actually serious. After my lecture, I went home, but now every time things get quiet, I get flooded with fear, not because anything happens, just because it reminds me of what happened while I was in that bathroom. It's 2:45am where I am right now and I'm once again the verge of tears because I can't stop thinking about it, I'm sitting on my bed in the corner of my room and feel to afraid to close my eyes because I keep worrying that whatever happened in that bathroom will happen again.

I haven't spoken to anyone about this because I would probably seem insane, but I wanted to post this here because I don't know what to do anymore.

***The Blue Man Part One...***

It was a regular morning at cranberry ridge. I was taking a shower in the dark like I usually do. I drew back the curtain, finished with my shower. I dry off and through the thin, old strands of my towel I see a bright vibrant but shadow-like fog figure. I pull down the towel and there is nothing. This happens over a few days.

About 2 weeks later I am attempting an astral project and I will do it for the first time. I'm confused when I realize I've done it. the articles, books, websites, all say that it's IMPOSSIBLE to do it the first try. I put that aside and I think of where I wanna go and I go to an old apple orchard.

I blink once and I'm at the entrance. And at the entrance is also, That figure I saw two weeks ago. My mind is racing. Who is this, or what is this figure. I blink again, still there. I can't move or look around. dumbfounded I try to speak, Nothing but a mist comes out. The figure Speaks in a low raspy noise. It says,

"I am what you would call, hmmm an illusion, though you might think of me as such but I am not of that sort. I am whom you may call,The Blue Man.”

I try to say something but I am not able to. As if The Blue Man is knowing my intentions he moves over to me, walking and whatever he steps on becomes a dull gray fog,

"Shush dear Ol Choit, Mortal in my tongue. I am from the far reaches of time and space. a realm not known to Ol'choit. But thou seems to be curious, you see, I am one of the very few of us. of the Soichik (Zoo-shik) Us, The Blue Ones. I am able to pluck a piece of your Consciousness and well, do this... watch closely Ol'choit."

He places a piece of fog on my wrist and a sharp pain pierces through my arm. A bloody scene takes over everything as The Blue Man well, Blood image version walks through a vast field of stars looking around with his piercing purple eyes, if there were any. but on the real version there are none. Then Bloody Man reaches far out and grabs a light he touches part of it and it becomes fog, it then floats away, The image becomes a forest, a forest with animals and tall oak trees and a river. The fog falls down and the fog becomes leaves.. The leaves fall and turn into fish. The fish fall into the river and they travel down to a lake, they then become water and the water flows into the ocean then over an endless water fall into the darkness. Then I fall into the darkness and my mind is racing, I try to say, "HELP!! WHAT'S HAPPENING!! PLEASE!!" but mist forms, I panic, heart pounding against my rib cage. I then fall into a navy blue stream which carries me through a tunnel of stars. but it's endless, I recognize this place. It's where the blue man is.

The Blue Man Appears again and he speaks.

"Now, Ol'choit, you see."

The Blue bloody man appears and plucks the same star, and everything happens again.

The Blue Man Speaks again.

"The Ol'choit, consciousness is like a river and leaves and fish and water, it all replenishes itself. We just take a piece and absorb it and drop part of its shell. There are ones who dont give back. only they take it all. but they only come when you call them, their name is Wey'on chal.

I begin to try to say it, The Blue Man tells me to not think it but he then says.

"It's too late they’re here."

The blue man appears over me and leans over. reaches for my wrist but the moment he touches it the stars disappear, I jolted up and spun around. this creature with large, blue eyes, pink head, long wavy arms and stubbed feet, a black and brown torso with dark black legs. it opens its mouth. I panic, heart racing trying to move. but i turn into a mist and get sucked down this mouth. The Blue Man tries to stop it but it's too late. I concentrate on moving my arms and they grip to the things teath. I force myself to stay solid and I crawl out of its mouth. The Blue Man Appears at the opening, he says.

"The Ol'choit who summons must be consumed.”

***The Blue Man Part 2***

After the blue man spoke those words to me, I could hear them echoing down the abyss of this creature's black void of a body, they stuck in my head, repeating themselves. As I float aimlessly, I regret some of my decisions. I start to fade into the darkness. Becoming another victim of this grief, the grief of the past people who were told the truth, the truth of the world, of the Blue Man.

The Blue Man is not one, but it's who The Blue Man are. The Blue Man.

I fade into darkness, the grief of people who were told, pull me into the abyss. I wonder how this all happened. I wonder if I will ever return.

Then I remember.

I wake up on my bed, lying there. But I feel different. I look at my arm and see grey marks going up my arm.

I look into the mirror and see the marks go up my neck, and into my eyes, my eyes glow a dark hue of yellow.

I stare into my own eyes and see images of the blood void, I start to see The Blue Man gathered around in a ring, but all The Blue Man is featureless.

Like the way I saw they.

The Blue Man looks like a scribbled stick figure drawn in blue ink. Fuzzy and the lines moving like an animation that is just the same figure drawn over and over.

I just stand there, staring into my own eyes. Seeing the same figure looking back at me. Grey, hair falling out in my fingers, eyes fading into white, skin darkening, body becoming shriveled, losing life, becoming stone, becoming nothing.

As Ol’Choit fades into stone. He sees a blue mist float by his face…

The Blue Man Stands in the corner.

The Blue Man Watches.

The Blue Man Sees

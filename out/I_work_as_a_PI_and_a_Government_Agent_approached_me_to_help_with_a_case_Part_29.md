“She looks fine. I think we avoided an apocalypse.” I said, a little bit winded from running so far.  

Maru let out a startled noise, his entire body turning on me with a terrible expression on his face. I wanted to ask him what was wrong but didn’t get the chance. Bebe’s body twitched. Something was happening to her that we didn’t have any idea about. Nick grabbed a hold of me and jumped back just as light started to spark out from the girl. Maru grew large bat wings to fly out of danger. Before our eyes, the small girl was turning into something else. Wind came from her, and light blinded us from the transformation. The force nearly tore off all the leaves from all the trees within a one-mile radius. I couldn’t breathe for a long while and thought I might suffocate. The wind died down before that happened. Surviving being so close to her as she transformed was the first hurdle. We now needed to figure out how to deal with whatever she had become.  

In front of us was a monster so large it dwarfed the trees. The face was a thing of beauty but the body was so bone chilling it was hard to look at even for a few seconds. Exposed ribs could be seen, the insides a twisted mess of vines with thorns. Countless arms moved from her back, making up a shape somewhat like wings. Long tangled hair reached down to wrap anything it touched. Her bottom half was hidden under layers of cloth made from scraps of fabric. Honestly, what Bebe had become was more of an end game boss than what we had ever needed to deal with before.   

Vines snapped out from under her ribs and came right for us. Nick went into action, his hand swiftly bringing out The Orchestra and cutting away those vines before they touched us. For every one he cut, ten more took its place. He was standing in front of his weaker partner trying to protect me from the attacks. A vine slipped over his shoulder grazing my face and sliced my cheek open just as Nick cut it away. I assured him I was fine as more came towards us. It appeared to be a losing battle. Normally The Orchestra could topple buildings, but the shockwaves that hit Bebe were healed the moment they cut her.  

Maru came crashing back down to Earth. He spoke some words with force and a light appeared. The vines bounced off it, protecting the three of us for a while. He was breathing hard, showing he needed to recover for a few minutes.  

“What happened? Why did she turn into this?” I asked him shocked.  

“We both have a key word that causes us to transform if we cross a certain stored energy threshold. The one who made us was impatient and wanted to be able to take out small countries if he couldn’t gather enough energy to end the world.” He said in a grave tone.  

I was the one who slipped up and said the wrong word, triggering all of this. We might have had a chance if Bebe stayed in her normal form. Neither of them would blame me. Nick quickly brought out my holster handing it over with five magazines this time. He often forgot to give me my gun until we needed it. We had only been going to get information before the park and he didn’t expect me to need a weapon. And when I caught up to them, we didn’t have time for an exchange. He also said his phone wasn’t working so we couldn’t even call for backup. All three of us were facing a world-ending creature without a plan or additional help.   

“We need to drain her of all her energy. We only have an hour before she self-destructs. The one who made us assumed that would be enough time to get away if he ever needed to use us.” Maru said looking up at his changed sister.  

The vines kept attacking us, and his shield was starting to show cracks. We didn’t have that much time to think of a plan.  

“Creatures use energy if they heal right? Would we be able to do enough damage to stop her and yet not kill her?” I asked and Maru shook his head.  

“I doubt it. I won’t be able to last very long out there. Unless you have insanely powerful bullets in that thing, then the attacks you were doing before would take days to use up her strength by healing, if you could even live that long.”  

We were in a tight spot. Looking at Nick, I silently asked him if he brought along any of those crazy powerful bullets with him. He shook his head. I was disappointed. They were far too strong to use and risked our lives if we did, but if we were going to die anyway, I would rather try and save Bebe. A new idea came to mind. The blood coming down my cheek was bothering me. I tried cleaning it the best I could while I spoke and only got my hands dirty.  

“Nickie, you said you could absorb supernatural things. Do they really need to be dead?” I asked hopeful. 

“They do. I’ve never been able to absorb anything else. Even if I could, I would be unable to store how much she currently has.” He said, killing my idea.  

“You couldn’t just, absorb it and put it into a harmless spell at the same time?” Maru asked, sounding tense at how many more cracks were appearing in our protection.  

Nick looked at him, then back towards me. A plan was forming in his mind. For some reason, I didn’t like it. The only time he had absorbed anything not dead was on the Twin Lizard case. What he had turned into then wasn’t himself. I never wanted to see him like that again. From what I could see, he was considering it. I didn’t even think he knew how to use that power, let alone let himself change like that on a whim.  

“On The Lizard case...” He started and I stopped him.  

“Nickie, we can’t. Whatever that power is, it’s bad news.” I said but he went on.  

“Aberash has theories about that power and how to use it. Before I blacked out, I saw red at the edge of my vision. It's happened a few other times but I’ve been able to force it back. I assume if I am injured, that state will try and take over in order to protect my life. The theory is, that power is myself turning closer to a stone. If I’m a stone, then I am a tool. You’ll be able to use me.”  

I kept shaking my head, never wanting to hear those words. In that moment I would rather die than ever seeing Nick like that, or even thinking about using my partner. It wasn’t just my life though. I was Nick’s, and Maru’s and even Bebe’s at risk. Not to mention how many people she might kill if we didn’t stop her. What we needed to do was let Nick get hurt. From how our wall was looking, that was going to happen soon. We didn’t have any other choices. Either die, or try and use Nick.   

“I don’t like this.” I replied regretfully.   

“Whatever it is, you need to decide in the next five seconds.”  

Maru turned away from us, his body ready to lift back up into the sky once the wall was broken. I pulled my gun from the holster, ready to fire. My job was to last long enough for Nick to let himself get hurt badly enough that his other power activated. It was a big risk. We were working off of theories, not facts. Neither of us really knew if he could let himself change in time, if at all.  

When the wall of light broke and vines came crashing through, nothing else mattered. I fired my gun, doing my best to take out anything trying to cut my body to pieces. Nick staying in front and swinging his sword to cut down the danger. Maru was also doing what he could. He flew, dodging attacks and throwing out some of his own. Each hit that landed was healed quickly after. During the chaos of the fight, my head turned too slowly. I saw a ball of dark purple light just before it hit. Nick tried cutting it away, just for it to travel through the shockwave and directly into me. The world turned dark as I suddenly could feel and see nothing.  

My eyes opened to a sight I never wanted to see. The sky appeared red in the night as everything was so silent. Those vines got a hold of Nick, wrapping his limp body in the air. So many of the thorns were digging into him and blood seeped through his clothes. I screamed, attempting to rush forwards. My feet refused to move and my gun was missing. This couldn’t be happening. I refused to believe it. I wanted to look away but my eyes remained glued at the sight as those vines started to pull and tear at the person I cared so much about. Just as his body was ripped apart and scattered, my own felt as if I was falling. My sight became unfocused. When I could see again, I looked around only to find the same horrible event play out again.   

I was trapped inside a nightmare of seeing my partner die over and over again. My mind knew this, and yet I still couldn’t calm down. Fear ripped through my body every time the scene ended, knowing I would have to watch it all over again. Finally, I was able to break through the loop. Crying, I placed my hands over my ears, drowning out the sound of blood dripping. I begged to see something, anything but that. The nightmare listened. Instead of being forced to watch Nick be ripped apart, I was in front of an endless field scattered with bodies of everyone I’ve come to know. Each of them killed in the most brutal of ways.   

I nearly snapped. Anyone might have after all of that. I was on my hands and knees, and tears were clouding my vision. I felt the mud slick with blood covering my hands. It was soaking through my jeans and making me feel dirty and guilty. I grit my teeth, trying my best to pull free from the spell. The ground rumbled and I looked up. My wet eyes were making it impossible to see in the distance for a few seconds.  

Giant beasts were moving towards me. Their bodies were made up of claws, mouths and spider legs. Each step shook the ground from just how big they were. The tears threatened to come back. Biting down on the inside of my mouth until I tasted blood, I shut my eyes tight staying in darkness.  

A deep rage started bubbling up from my stomach. It was taking over my entire body. Soon the tears weren’t from fear but from how pissed off I was. On shaking legs, I stood up. My entire body was trembling, with the footsteps getting ever closer.   

“Oh, fuck off!” I shouted as loud as I could.  

Something cracked. The sounds cut out, and I felt wind blowing across my face. I was no longer trapped inside whatever nightmare I was in a few seconds ago, but was instead being carried by Nick. He'd placed me on his back and was jumping around avoiding the vines going after us. He turned to look over his shoulder to see if I was awake and recovering. I really hoped I didn’t just shout at him. Maru flew over, face flushed from dodging attacks for so long.  

“You escaped a nightmare? Good job! Don’t get hit again!”   

He was unable to stay long. He flew off, to distract his sister away from us as best he could. Keeping a grip on Nick’s shoulder, I looked him over. His face was cut and his suit jacket was in tatters from the thorns. He didn’t get torn apart, but he was still hurt. While I was out, he’d taken all the attacks head on, using his body as a shield.  

“How’s your vision?” I asked over the sounds of the battle.   

“Seeing a little bit of red.” He replied in an even tone as he jumped out of the way.  

This was now or never. More of those balls of light shot out. It would only take one of them to hit Nick for it to be all over. I couldn’t defend him if he fell into a nightmare. Maru was losing speed. This battle was almost over if we didn’t pull out our trump card. We risked letting so many lives end. I took a deep breath, ready for whatever would happen next.   

“Alright. You can give in. No matter what, I’ll be here.”  

I only saw my partner give a small nod with his head. He ran along the vines until he was pretty high in the air and jumped. As we fell towards the monster and the countless vines shooting through the air ready to kill us, his hair changed. It broke free of the elastic holding it back. My stomach was fluttering in fear and anxiety. The first time I’d seen Nick like this, his hair turned into a darker red and almost glowed. This time, it swayed free as if underwater. Near the bottom it was shining a brighter red than the rest. I was unable to see his face. The vines headed our way never reached us. They disappeared in a red light as if being burned away. We were risking his life, and Bebe’s. I didn’t want to regret what we were doing. 

We kept going, falling through the set of exposed ribs and inside the monster. The swarm of vines trying to get at us and burning away just before they touched us. Nick grabbed onto a single vine and held it firmly in his hand. I felt something then. There were no words, just a rattling in my brain. A question of what do to. I mentally answered to drain away her magic but just enough to still leave her alive and well. 

The moment the process started to happen, I was overwhelmed. My body was slammed with intense pain. It was similar to being on a roller-coaster, but one going far too fast for the human body to handle. Every nerve fired off at once, and my organs felt as if they were getting compressed. I heard a girl screaming. This wasn’t only my pain, but what Bebe was feeling. By ripping her magic away, we were hurting her. I never wanted this. If I could take all the pain onto myself so she wouldn’t feel it, I would. I fooled myself into thinking we shared half the burden.  

Another wordless question came. A query of what to do with all this magic. I couldn't think of anything and mentally told Nick to do whatever he wanted, only to have him ask again. While in his near stone state, he was unable to think for himself. Everything hurt. It was impossible to focus on detailed thoughts. I couldn’t think of anything to turn this magic into. My body was nearing its limits. I would not last the next few minutes. The fear of death was clouding my thoughts along with all the pain. I vaguely remember thinking that Nick should use the magic to make something nice. Something he would enjoy. By some miracle, that answer was enough. The magic he collected had already shot out, turning into something else.  

I blacked out before the process was complete, unable to glimpse what he had created from the magic we stole.  

Maru was the one who woke me up. He was lightly tapping my cheek and the sun was rising. He helped me to sit up and I wondered where we were. The place was covered in golden flowers that gave off a dim light. My body was still sore, but not as bad as I expected. I reached up to check on the cut on my face to find it gone. Maru was also looking fine.   

“Is Nick...?” I asked, my voice hoarse and still recovering.  

“Over there resting. I was knocked out of the sky and woke up near to you.” Maru explained.  

We both went over to Nick to see that he did not end up as well as us. His hands were terribly burned, but aside from that it didn’t appear like he had suffered too many side effects. We both helped him sit up. Maru then went looking for any sign of his sister. Nick was barely keeping his eyes open when the Incubus found her hidden in the golden flowers. When we noticed she lacked any clothing, Nick quickly gave up his suit jacket for her to have something to wear. Maru gratefully took it, near tears to see his sister was somehow still alive, just a bit sleepy.   

“We need to call for someone to clear the scene...” Nick said as he stood up, his voice also strained.  

He was going to go on, but my partner suddenly turned pale. Turning away without a word, he went beside a tree to do something I never thought he would. He threw up some sort of black sludge for a few minutes. I tried comforting him and patted his back unaware of what to do. I’ve never even seen him eat anything. What on Earth was inside his stomach? When the sludge hit the ground, it faded in the sunlight starting to come over the trees. My best guess was he was getting sick from any leftover magic.  

I called for backup that arrived fairly quickly. They needed to ensure the scene was no longer dangerous and confirm that the new golden flowers were harmless things made from magic. Nick sat against the tree, still pale but not getting sick any more. His hands were showing no sign of healing as one agent started to wrap them for him. They also brought along real clothing for Bebe. She was able to approach us after getting changed, suit jacket folded in her hands.  

I opened my mouth to apologize for the pain we caused, but she started speaking with a red face and tears in her eyes.  

“Thank you for saving me!” She said, looking as if she was about to cry.  

We just happened to be a pair that found it easier to save her than kill her. If a different set of agents had taken the job, a completely different outcome would have happened and she knew that. She straightened up and I took the jacket from her and thanked her. To my horror, I noticed something when I was seeing her clearly for the first time. She was cute. Super cute. Totally my type. Shy, round face and big golden eyes. I’ve never been so struck by someone’s appearance since first laying eyes on Aberash. I cleared my throat determined not to let her appearance get the better of me.  

“I’m glad we were able to help out. Nick did all the hard work though.”  

He attempted a nod, but was so tired he nearly fell asleep from the effort.  

“Please let me know if I can repay you in any way. I can offer my services to either of you if you’d like.” She said, her hands fiddling with the edge of her sweater.   

Maru noticed my reaction after he walked over. A sly smile over his face.  

“Oh, so she does it for you?”  

I would have punched him but Bebe did it for me. She slammed her fist so hard into his stomach it knocked him over. I smiled when she turned around, appearing embarrassed by her sibling.  

“You are cute, but I really need to refuse. We’re just glad that you’re alive and I would rather not do that sort of thing because the other person thinks they owe me. And Nickie doesn't do that sort of thing at all.” I explained, and she appeared relieved by my answer.  

“If you need anything, please call me. I’ll do my best to help out.”  

I had gained another phone number and a new friend. She also wanted Nick to have her number so we wrote it down on one of his notepads that had fallen out of his suit pocket when she put it on earlier. I let her leave to get checked over and cleared to head home after a very long and stressful day. As far as I could tell, she wouldn’t be in trouble for anything that happened. Her victims, as it were, all consented to the acts. She was under a spell that controlled her, and the one who cast it had already died. Nearly dying herself was punishment enough.  

I sat down next to Nick, jacket and notebook in hand. He was a bit more awake so I placed both items on his lap.  

“Why do you think you made all of these flowers?” I gestured towards the park, which was now covered in golden sunlight that matched the flowers perfectly.  

“I don’t remember. They feel familiar but I am unaware of why, though I know I was the cause of them.” He said, voice still weak.  

I should let him get some rest. Nick was distracted and looked from between where Bebe was speaking to some agents and back towards myself.  

“Is that the reason why you’ve rejected so many advances?”  

My love life was the last thing I ever expected Nick to ever care about. I stiffened, never noticing just how many girls I’ve passed on. In my mind they all were just being friendly and not actual options. And even if they were, most I didn’t even consider because of the not owing me something rule. Aside from all that, it was strange Nick had brought it up. Was he worried somehow?  

“For the most part, yeah. But I also don’t really have time for dating. I’m trying to keep up with my own P.I. company and doing cases with you. That’s not a bad thing either. I'm just not looking for a girlfriend right now. And even if I did get one, I’m not going to cut you out. To borrow an offensive turn of phrase, Bros before Hoes and all that.”  

“I'm not certain what that means.” He admitted.  

I needed to find an empty page of his note book to write it down and the meaning behind it. To get the topic off myself, I held up the closed book to ask about it.  

“Why do you make so many notes anyway?”  

He looked up, trying to figure out how to phrase his next statement.   

“After my first partner died, I lost a lot of my memories. My head is still scattered and I doubt I’ll ever recover my past. I wanted to never lose anything important like that again if I could help it.”  

His tone and words made the small notebook feel as if it was a hundred pounds. The object was suddenly so precious it was almost hard holding onto it. The pages were worn and its cover was faded, showing it was an older one. I could only imagine what he’d written down inside.  

“You can look inside if you want.”  

I was startled by how easily he gave me permission. Here I was, holding something that gave an extremely deeper insight into who he was. I would have thought he would feel that looking through it was an invasion of his privacy. I desperately wanted to know more about my partner, so with slightly trembling hands, I flipped open to one of the front pages. The single word neatly written a while ago caused a reaction I never would have expected.   

On the page was just,  

Cheese?   

Nothing else. My face cracked into a smile and I was unable to stop myself from snorting out a laugh. There was no way I would ever understand what possessed Nick to write that down. He was a little offended by my reaction and calmly took the book away. Then tried to hide peeking inside to see what I found so funny, not understanding in the slightest.   

I would never be trusted with that book again. We were called over to fill out a report and go over the case. Nick found he was unable to stand up. His odd power had unknown side effects every time he used it. The other agent agreed to let us fill out the report sitting down. I took the forms and pen because Nick’s hands were still hurt.  

As I wrote, I wanted to mess with him a little more.  

“I grew up in Canada you know. We have poutines over there. It's super easy to make, but I can find a place that makes it just right. It's just fries, gravy and cheese curds. The best are the ones that squeak.”  

He listened, nodding along. When he thought I wasn’t looking, he wrote down Curds? With a shaking hand in his notebook. It took everything in me not to laugh. I paused writing the report, not knowing if I should mention Nick’s other state. In the end, I needed to. But I wrote that only Aberash and Ancaer should read what happened hoping whoever submitted this listened.  

“Nick, I don’t ever want to use that power again. Aside from it being unreliable, we just don’t know enough about it. You can’t stand, your hands are hurt and the last time it took you weeks before you could work again. It's not this secret weapon we can use to get out of trouble. Who knows what is going to happen to you next.”  

My voice was serious trying to get my point across. We got lucky this time around. Aside from that, I simply didn’t like him while he was like that. He wasn’t my partner. He turned into something dangerous. An unknown weapon that could fall into the wrong hands. If I wasn’t his partner, then what would a different person try and use him for? I didn’t want to think of that outcome. At least Nick agreed with me. He would only ever consider using it if we were out of other options and it would save my life.  

When the report was written out, he needed help getting down the path and to the car to take him home. I worried about just how long he would be down for after that night. It wasn’t until after I was dropped back off in front of my apartment, that I realized what we had done that night. We saved a good number of lives. Somehow, I could only think of three of them and was glad everything turned out fine. One more case closed, a little bit more learned. And I really needed a nap.

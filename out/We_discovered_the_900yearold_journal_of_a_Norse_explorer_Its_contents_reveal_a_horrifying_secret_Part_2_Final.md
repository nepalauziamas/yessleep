 

Espen had apparently more connections than I could have imagined, as after a single phone call, a sizable entourage had showed up at the site just as we were departing back down the road, presumably to prepare the coffin for transit to a more materially sterile environment whilst the book resided in an air-tight bag in the backseat of the jeep. We found ourselves back in the dining hall after the short drive. Drinks in hand, we repeated the previous night with triple the spirits in celebration of our findings. When we eventually dismissed ourselves for the night, I found myself easily lulled to sleep by the spell of drunkenness, although I never was a prolific drinker, I would allow it on this occasion. When I awoke, I was surprised to find that the headache was not as intense as I had expected. I took a moment to mentally scold myself for such unprofessionalism with my newly replenished sense of clarity before readying myself for the day. 

Last night it had been decided that Espen, Aurora and both of Johannes’ henchmen, Kurt and Anette, whose names I’d discovered through drunken games of Truth or Dare, would be heading back out to the site to perform EMS readings around the surrounding area to see if the ground could yield yet more artifacts whilst leaving the remaining two of us to begin analyzing the book. After spitting out the last round of mouthwash in a largely unsuccessful attempt to eliminate the lingering taste of alcohol, I gathered my laptop and printed texts before heading down to the study room which was elected to be our base of operations. When I arrived at the coffeehouse-esque lounge, Johannes was already hunched over the book which lay flat on one of the round tables, surrounded by various notes and hardcover reference texts. He acknowledged me as I placed my own materials down next to him. 

“Anything so far?” I asked, seeing as how he’d likely been at it for a decent deal of time before I had even woken up, judging by the nearby empty thermos and strong smell of hotel room coffee on his breath that was detectable even from a few meters away. 

“So far, I’ve only been able to confidently understand that the author identifies themself as a man by the name of Sigmundur, or otherwise, Sigmund in the anglicized version, who is of course certainly the man in the coffin given the seemingly strong significance this book appeared to have had with him.” Johannes explained, inquisitively resting his fist beneath his chin before continuing.

“Although I have yet to decipher any further, I do find this reference to the self unusual for Norse writings, albeit this *is* your specialty, after all.” 

I had agreed with him, written material from Norse scribes often came in the form of sagas; stories of strength and valor, told entirely from third person perspectives. 

“Mind if I take a crack at it?” 

“By all means.” Johannes said, closing the book before passing it on to me. It was the first time I had held it in my hands. The leather cover still felt dense and tough, not withered and flaky like I had initially expected. The parchment paper pages bore the same qualities, although stained to varying degrees as I opened the book. It was strange looking down at the words that filled the first page.

Each letter was almost a millennia, yet even then I could make out each stroke of the stylus formulating each word. It was then that I began the process of translating the first lines of text through the process of comparing the Old Norse language with that of Icelandic and Faroese. It may not be one hundred percent spot on, but the ultimate goal is coming up with something we could understand. Through the first couple pages, I discovered that the author did indeed identify themselves by the name Sigmundur. I thought it to be such a bold and noble sounding name, and my mind was cluttered with several possibilities of who he may have been. 

A member of nobility? Or perhaps a legendary warrior? He was evidently a prolific writer, which given the time was an impressive intellectual feat on its own. After a while, I became lost in my own thoughts as I worked to piece it all together, jotting down the translation in modern English on a separate set of pages that I had so cleverly stapled together to create a kind of makeshift notebook. As I worked, it became apparent to me that the book was not as long as I had first thought, and it was agreed upon that the work be divided between us, with me translating the first 20 or so pages and him finishing the remainder. 

And so, I spent the rest of the day well into the creeping hours of night at that table in the study room, each word translated feeling like a small victory as I uncovered the thoughts that once resonated within another’s psyche some nine hundred years ago. Espen and the others had returned sometime in the evening, purportedly not finding anything of interest save for the odd tin can or stray piece of scrap metal, although they had planned on heading back out to the site early in the morning to conduct one last thorough survey. When the time approached 2AM, I made the executive decision to call it a night. My eyes had grown heavy, and no amount of caffeine could safeguard me against the ever-growing sense of drowsiness that had begun to seize my senses. 

I closed the book, gathered my things and headed back to my room, almost instantly drifting off upon contact with the soft bedding after having placed the book along with my materials on the nearby work desk. My senses nulled as I descended into a state of sleep before being disturbed once again by the sight of nothing but a pure, white bleakness. I sat up, feeling the hard, earthen ground on my hands and legs. I scanned my surroundings and saw that I was once again in that forest, the one from the night before last, the same gargantuan, coniferous trees extended up against a dreary sky, turning them into pitch black silhouettes in contrast. I pulled myself to my feet, and not seeing any other productive alternatives, began to wander. 

As I made my way through the brush, I began to take note of certain things that I had not noticed before in my previous dream, such as the complete lack of ambience of any kind. No chorus of the sounds of birds or any other wildlife, not even the slightest whisk of wind. Only an infinite silence and stillness permeated the vast expanse of woodland I found myself in. That was until the silence was suddenly shattered by the sounds of screaming. The voice sounded close, and as if it were in absolute agony, a horrid mix of pain and limitless terror.

I rapidly spun my body around, checking each and every direction, only to be met with the same endless expanse of trees. It was then that I heard the rapid thumping of footsteps against the forest floor. I shot my gaze immediately in the direction that they appeared to be emanating from, and after initially not being able to make out the source, I spotted what looked to be a man as he slowed to a brief stop in a nearby clearing after having bolted out from the trees. He looked to be rather young, but it was what he carried on his person that stood out to me as peculiar. He wore a red, long-sleeved tunic that bore intricate designs which had reminded me somewhat of those that I had often seen in numerous illustrations depicting Germanic peoples of the early Middle Ages. 

The thought was further amplified by the Norman style helmet that sat upon the man’s head, its steel surface almost glowing a pale white as it reflected the snow-white sky above. It was complemented by long, brown hair that hung from under its exterior and draped down behind his shoulders, resembling that of a waterfall. Finally, it was also what the man carried in his hands that completed the Dark Age visual. He held what was discernible to me as a Dane axe judging by the shape of the blade on the fearsome weapon, which he held low to his stomach with both hands as he seemed to recuperate himself. By all accounts he looked every part of that of a historical Viking warrior, complete with the addition of a mildly broad chest, making him look like a worthy asset for a bloody and legendary battle.  

The man had looked visibly winded, his labored and rapid breathing audible from my spot amongst the trees. Though his face was slightly obscured by both his long hair as well as the nasal guard on his helm, I could still see that he bore a mask of pure fear. He rapidly switched his gaze in every direction, like he was scanning the woods for an unseen assailant. He seemed to have not noticed me despite standing perfectly in plain sight, captivated by what I was seeing. After a moment of this, he turned on his heel and took off through the trees on the other end of the clearing, the sound of his leather boots beating against the ground growing more distant with each passing second.

Just then, I heard the snapping and shifting of branches as something else made its presence known at the edge of the clearing the man had just been in. My body tensed and froze as the same entity from before materialized from out of the trees, its massive, spindly body contrasting against its surrounding with a vehement sense of wrongness, its form looking as that of a shadow that spread amongst the trees. There was, however, something slightly different about it. In a few areas upon its otherwise dark gray skin, I could see large swaths of a crimson substance that was splattered across its body with each of its “fingers” also coated red with the stuff, occasional drops of it dripping from their tips. It turned its head in a seemingly impossible 270-degree angle like that of an owl, scanning the surrounding woods, presumably searching for the man I had just seen before its massive, black eyes locked on me.

For what seemed like an eternity, we simply stared at one another before a brief and unexpected sense of clarity filled my mind and I had realized despite the creature’s emotionless mask of a face, it was screaming. 

I jolted awake, my hands clenching the covers with twice the intensity as before. My forehead was speckled with cold sweat which coincided with my rapid and shallow breathing. As reality returned to me, I quickly deduced the nightmare as yet another product of my recent experiences while abroad for the first time, but even then, the image of that *thing* locking its eyes with my own remained in my thoughts for some time after waking up. It seemed appalling to me that my subconscious mind could think up something so purely otherworldly. Nonetheless, I stuffed these thoughts into the farthest corners of my mind, focusing on the task at hand as I carried on with my usual morning routine before gathering the book as well as my reference texts and headed back to the study room.

As it was mutually decided that Johannes would complete the second half of the translation process, I found him seated at the same table in the study room just as he was doing away with the last bites of his breakfast. 

“It seems as though the Faroese prefer their eggs on the *under* easy side” he said, prodding a visibly raw egg on his plate before pushing it aside. 

I set my books down on the table along with the partially written translation, as I had offered to lend them to him for additional material to work off of. He thanked me with a slight nod before opening the book to resume where I had left off.

“Where’s everyone else?” I asked beforehand

“Conducting one last sweep of the excavation site. Espen said that if nothing else turned up, our work here would be concluded. In the meantime, I’ll get to work on finishing this up, and to you, I recommend doing a bit of exploring. The locals do a fine job at taking the piss out of each other whenever the right amount of drinks are involved, it's quite a spectacle to behold.”

With that, Johannes resumed his previous task with a small chuckle under his breath, and with that, I bid him a temporary goodbye, telling him I’d be back to check in later as I departed the room. The day was largely uneventful, with the only truly notable occurrence being the fact that I practically hurled my guts out upon being served a plate of the infamous ‘Svið’ at the local bar that was a staple in Icelandic cuisine. With my appetite thoroughly extinguished, I found myself back in my room at the inn, idling in my own thoughts, many of which were of the coffin and of the man that had been consecrated within it for a whole millennia. The day had begun to falter into night, and my thoughts were interrupted by the sound of knocking on my door. I opened it to see Johannes standing in the doorway, and I immediately noticed something different about his demeanor.

The happy-go-lucky grin he often bore upon his face was absent, replaced with an expression that was a conflicted mix of both contemplation and disconcertment. I then saw that he held the translation packet in his hands, looking much denser than before, signifying its completion. 

“It's finished, your books were certainly useful, but the final result is…unusual” Johannes’ eyes trailed off to the side, as if recalling an unpleasant memory. 

“Unusual?” I questioned.

“Well, it isn’t like any other piece of written material of Norse or even pre-modern European origin I’ve ever seen before. It's much more like a personal journal rather than a saga, and its contents are….” 

Johannes then extended his hands with the packet towards me before finishing his thought.

“I feel that it’d be more comprehensible if you read the full translation for yourself.” 

I took the packet, assuring Johannes that I’d take a look before we bid each other goodnight. Closing the door behind me, I flipped on the desk lamp that sat on the work desk near the vintage looking TV before taking my seat. After preparing myself a tall cup of the herbal tea from the small basket that sat atop the nightstand, I cleared my mind as I began to read Sigmundur’s journal. 

**1164 Anno Domini**

“To any of my kinsmen, or indeed, any man of sound mind who may come upon this memoir, I ask that you perceive my words with a learned psyche. I am Sigmundur of Føroyar, and I wish to profess my personal testimonial of events experienced by me and several other men whilst in the lands of Markland.”

My excitement had grown immaculate during the first few pages of the translation process, as I already knew this “Markland '' referred to a land somewhere in North America according to the literary sources relating to Lief Erikson’s expedition. At this point, this had become something far more to me. I did my best to grapple with the idea of being one of the first people of the modern world to lay eyes on the words written out before me before I continued to read.

“My story begins when I was in my younger years. My father, Toralv, had sent for me to reside amongst the islands near the land of Alba with his most trusted relatives, fearing that war with a neighboring earl was imminent. Me being his one and only son, I cannot say I blamed him, especially given that my mother and sister had been taken in a previous raid many summers ago. I was merely seventeen years when I departed from Norvegr, my father unable to journey with me due to his administrative status amongst the people of Trondheim which had been under the threat of invasion by a neighboring earldom. While I felt bitterness at the thought of being on my lonesome amongst the likes of sheep herders, I still had a great deal of respect for my father for upholding his oaths.

Before boarding the longship, he had gifted me with a greataxe, the likes of which I had only ever seen crafted upon the island of Götland. It was a mighty weapon, and I came to cherish it above many things as I do now even still. Upon arriving on the island that would become my new home, located just south of Thor’s Harbor, I was warmly welcomed into the community which was led by the chieftain and half-brother to my father, Torsten Hrafnkell. Within the following few years, I became highly acquainted with farm work, as was the profession of the whole of the inhabitants of Føroyar. During this time, I had grown restless, and had yearned to make something more of myself. 

I wished to be an adventurer and a warrior as my forefathers before me, my faith in that ambition kept burning by the axe my father had given me, which I had come to bestow the name of “Trygg” unto it. I had not heard from my father since I was sent away. I had never felt more alone. It was at summer’s end in 1144 that what little hope I had left at earning my name a place of memory was rekindled with a fierce blaze of high-strung vigor. I had just finished my daily task of tending to the barley crop when my attention was drawn by a large congregation down by the shore.

A large longship, the likes I had not seen anywhere before was docked before the pier. Several men had disembarked and looked to be conversing with several of the other local men, including Torsten. We rarely had any visitors to the island, and thus this enticed my interest, and I joined the small crowd at the dock. After listening to their conversation, I understood that the men from the ship, represented by a tall, red-haired man, were from Iceland, and that they were seeking additional members for an expedition to Markland. Markland…the name sent ripples through my psyche. I had only heard of Markland as a child. 

It was a far-off land to the west, unexplored and previously unknown to the rest of the world. My father had recounted to me the story of Erik the Red and his famed expedition to these enigmatic western lands, who had supposedly found it to be utterly wild, untamed, and initially uninhabited, that was before encountering a tribe of wildmen, upon which relations deteriorated before escalating into war, eventually forcing Erik and his men to depart back across the sea. The tall man, who had introduced himself as Frode, continued to converse with Torsten before they appeared to come to an agreement. A brief exchange of silver coins followed by an ample amount of supplies being carried from the village smokehouse and loaded onto the longship.

When Frode then announced to the crowd that he would be accepting at least a few more men to accompany him on his expedition, my hand had immediately shot high above my head, as did one other, in which I saw that it belonged to Destin, another local youth and friend of mine. Whilst I saw this as a chance to earn my place in the many sagas of my kinsfolk, I had felt it as a duty to my family name, as far as I knew, I am the one and only free and living man remaining of my bloodline, and I did not wish to spend the entirety of my life as a simple farmer. Torsten had expressed a mild disapproval of my desire to join Frode on his journey, reasoning that my father had entrusted me to his community for my own protection and that I was compromising his wishes. I disregarded this, as I felt myself free to make my own choices and that my decision was a kind of rite of passage. I collected Trygg from my homestead as well as what tools and supplies I could comfortably carry upon myself and met Destin back at the dock where we both boarded the ship just as the last textiles were hauled onto the deck. It was from there that I departed from the island for the first time in years, all lands familiar to both myself and my kinsmen growing smaller upon the horizon as we passed into foreign waters. 

The journey across the sea was largely tame albeit with frequent, yet mild storms. We ate dried fish with stale bread which was accompanied by ale, and I had never longed more for a hot meal than in the moment the first bites of that bone dry bread and papery fish passed my lips. Aside from myself and Destin, there were 23 men that made up Frode’s expedition, many of which were pagans, and thus often found themselves verbally at odds with the Christian expeditionary members. These quarrels were often subdued by Frode who’d remind us all that we had a common ambition to reach the plentiful and delightfully enigmatic land of Markland, with us being the first to make the journey since its existence was foretold of through the legacy of an earlier explorer by the name of Lief Eriksson. For the duration of the journey, I had grown to know Frode as both a stern and highly educated man with extensive navigational skills. 

His followers were drawn mainly from Iceland, with the odd Dane for every few men and of course there was myself and Destin, who in the years I had spent acquainted with learned that he was a Swede, the son of a Jarl in Mälar who’d been murdered by a political opponent. He was seated beside me as the longship cut through the freezing waters, gripping his cherished sword close to him as it sat in its scabbard upon his belt, likewise gifted to him by his father prior to his death. Due to his own circumstances mirroring my own, his motives for joining the expedition likewise matched my own. Aside from the mundane food, I often found myself lacking sleep as the nights while on the water were always restless, each wave through the water knocking me awake as I lay upon the hardwood deck. 

By day, I could see nothing but endless ocean on all sides, expanding endlessly to the horizon and beyond without a single semblance of land in sight. Frode had informed us that he estimated we’d make landfall within a week with the ultimate goal of establishing a permanent settlement in which to open the door for future territorial enterprise. It was almost fantastical to me, the idea of us being the only ones in an untouched and uncharted land, like Adam and Eve exploring their Garden for the first time following their creation. That week soon passed, and many of the men had begun to doubt Frode’s sense of direction and even the existence of Markland itself. Just then, there was a commotion that pierced the ocean air and had stirred me from my slumber one morning in Gormánuðr.

Land had been spotted in the distance and indeed, I could see the coast on the horizon, stretching from north to south endlessly. We rejoiced as our longship bore closer to the foreign shores. We all lept off and onto the sand just as the hull had made contact with the beach, eager to feel the stable ground beneath our feet for the first time in over a month, which had felt strange at first, the constant shifting and bobbing of the ship’s deck now absent. The cool autumn breeze carried the pleasant scents of pine sap and nectar bearing plants, surviving relics of the previous summer. After our moment of relief after having been freed from our oceanic prison, Frode had chosen three men to scout ahead inland to search for a suitable place to set up a proper camp. 

The scouts had armed themselves with crossbows from the ship, and I was staunchly reminded of the stories of Skraelings that allegedly inhabited these lands. We watched as the scouts made their way up the beach and then disappeared into the outlying forest, in which we then busied ourselves with unloading our supplies from the ship. Just as we hauled the last of our cargo onto the shore, the scouts returned and told of a clearing within the woods up ahead that was accompanied by a freshwater stream. We spent a large part of the day carrying our supplies to the site. I was awestruck at the sheer immensity of the landscape: vast and seemingly endless frontier as far as the eye could see. 

We encountered flora and fauna the likes of which none of us had ever laid eyes upon; the streams filled with titanically large fish and towering pine trees that threatened to block out the sky. We set to work on our campsite, pitching our tents to accommodate ourselves all the while so more permanent housing could be constructed utilizing the immediate and abundant supply of lumber available to us. We did what we could as the evening slipped into night, and we all settled into our tents for our first night asleep on dry land in weeks. I spoke to Destin beforehand, who’d pitched his tent across from mine and we agreed that we’d volunteer to scout the surrounding woodland in the morning to seek out any more long-term food sources or perhaps any signs of Skraelings. That night had been perhaps among the most blissful of my life, finally receiving a proper slumber after weeks of being shaken awake by the sudden tremor of a wave against the ship’s bow. 

The following morning, I partook of a breakfast of fresh fish roasted over the fire before taking Trygg from my tent and meeting Destin outside the camp. Before departing, I had also dawned a spangenhelm from the camp’s de facto armory for added measure as we were about to set out into unknown land. Frode bid us goodbye and had told us not to venture out too far. With that, we set off, Destin leading ahead through the dense, uncharted woods. By then, an ample cover of clouds had engulfed the sky above the trees, painting it a bleak and dreary pale in which only the bright colors of our tunics remained the only things that maintained any semblance of vibrancy within the now dismal environment. 

We had traveled a supposed 2 and a half miles from the camp without incident, and more so, we had hoped the forest would have given way to more visibility intensive land, and yet, nothing but seemingly endless trees lay ahead before us with no end in sight. After continuing along the forest floor for a few more paces, I noticed the distinct silence that gripped our surroundings. The ambience of birds and other small creatures that had previously rung through the trees had ceased utterly, replaced only with the sound of our boots treading against the ground. My hands tightened around the handle of my weapon, and I could see that Destin had noticed the foreboding silence as well, his feet dug in place ahead of me and his hand firm against the hilt of his sword at his side. We both looked upon our surroundings, expecting the large form of a bear or perhaps a pack of wolves to emerge from the trees to challenge us. 

Then I noticed something amongst the trees. Each component pieced itself together to form the shape of a man, only that it was not a man, it was immensely tall, standing so unyieldingly still and its form so impossibly thin as if it were a wicker man composed of logs. For a moment, it simply stood beside the trees, mimicking their inanimate forms so perfectly that I had only picked out the monstrous thing when my eyes beheld its own; two large, black eyes that were the shape of almond seeds and sat upon an otherwise completely featureless face. It possessed no mouth or nose, only those two horrid eyes. Before the words could escape my mouth, the beast had abruptly sprung from its place among the trees, its limbs instantly snapping into action with such haste that it reminded me of a spider bearing down on its prey that had fallen into its web.

Destin had not a moment to react before it was upon him. The abhorrent thing silently snatched him up off the ground with one swipe of its hand which was host to five, disproportionately long fingers that bore sharp tips, resembling that of spears. I stood and watched, frozen with a horrible disbelief at what I was beholding. I was no stranger to war or to death. When I was a mere boy, I witnessed the attempted sacking of our lands and I have seen savagery in its purest form, but what this thing did next will haunt me forever. 

As Destin struggled in the creature’s grasp, it brought up its other monstrous hand and instead of tearing him apart with limitless ferocity like I had so painstakingly expected, it instead calmly and meticulously inserted one of its spear-like fingers into Destin’s abdomen, puncturing his body and emerging out from his back. My friend’s agonized cries split the air. I readied my axe, preparing to charge and bury my blade into the creature’s seemingly frail form, but the monster continued its previous action, pulling its hideous fingers from his body before once again impaling him, each time moving up closer from his abdomen towards his head, and each time, the unholy sight of it all smashing my resolve to fight as I pictured myself suffering the same terrible fate. I simply stood and watched as Destin’s cries were finally silenced as the creature inserted its finger into his neck, his screams now replaced with a low gurgle.

The beast then turned its head to lock its eyes with my own, still with Destin’s limp, partially disemboweled corpse grasped tightly in its hand. Every instinct cried out for me to run, and so I turned on my heel and made haste back in the direction we had come. I charged through the endless expanse, dodging the branches of trees and bushes as I swept through the woods as fast as my feet could carry me, praying that the beast had not elected to pursue me. These hopes were soon laid low as I dared to look back and to my utmost horror, saw that the thing was trailing me by no more than twenty paces. It moved in the same erratic and ungodly manner as it had when it had set itself upon Destin, seeming to snap itself into place rather than stepping into it. 

My feet propelled me faster yet as I subconsciously said a flurry of prayers, begging God for salvation from the demon that pursued me and just as my lungs had begun to waver, I saw a break between the trees up ahead which were illuminated by the presence of several controlled fires. I barged out from the trees and into the middle of the camp before coming to a stop, utterly breathless. I turned back to the tree line from where I had just come, expecting the beast to come charging out after me with a heavy anticipation, but it did not. The monstrous creature was gone. The men in the camp all looked upon me with a mix of puzzlement and concern and I was immediately questioned on what had happened. 

I recounted my story exactly as it had transpired which had beckoned mixed reactions from the men, with some of the more superstitious believing that we had been the victims of an attack by a Jötunn. In contrast, Frode along with several other men had interpreted my story as having been an ambush done by Skraelings, and he and at least twelve other men proceeded to dawn chainmail and arm themselves with spears, shields, and crossbows. I had profusely warned Frode of the monstrous horror that lay within those wicked woods, but he simply disregarded my foretelling as the ramblings and exaggerations of a frightened man. He ordered the rest of us to remain in the camp as he and his cohort disappeared into the tree line.”

I stopped reading. My heart rate had been gradually picking up pace accompanied by a sickly tightness in my chest. Everything described here was uncomfortably identical to my dreams. For a while, I simply sat at the desk, my mind a swirling maelstrom as it attempted to grasp the reality of what I had read, and, seeing no other productive alternative, I continued to read.

“I spent a great deal of time pacing around my corner of the campsite, my mind still coming to terms with what I had witnessed. Frode and his men returned to camp what I estimated to have been just an hour later. They had not encountered Skraelings or any Jötunn, nor did they find Destin’s cadaver, only his sword remained which they found lying on the leaf strewn ground, speckled with blood. I had expected them to ridicule me for my version of events, but instead many of the men who’d left to investigate, including Frode, bore a visible sense of unease, and I knew that at least some of them must have seen the beast, perhaps watching them from the trees with those horrid black eyes. The next two weeks passed largely without incident, and any scouting expeditions sent beyond the camp always consisted of no less than five men.

Whilst there were no encounters with anything out of the ordinary, many a time the scouts returned with reports of gargantuan claw marks etched into the sides of large stones, entire trees seeming to have been pushed aside and snapped as if they were twigs and supposedly the sound of humming echoing from the distance, but no matter how much they pursued the noise, it always remained distant. Secondly, there appeared to be a distinct lack of wildlife throughout the entire region. In the time we’d been there, not one of us had ever seen a single deer or elk, not even a rabbit. Therefore the only source of meat we had access to was the fish from the surrounding streams. In the time we’d been encamped there, we had a chance to improve the camp’s infrastructure, constructing a crude wall consisting of sharpened logs.

By then, the first waves of winter had begun to set in. Light flurries of snow gave way to heavy flakes that piled into a heavy powder upon the ground. We had not gathered as much food as we had hoped, and the supply of our loosely constructed storage house soon began to dwindle. The streams were frozen solid which made any further fishing a near impossible prospect. At night, I often lay awake, seemingly forever blighted by what I had seen, and the death of my friend. 

Sometimes I thought I could see the beast, its abyssal eyes watching from the trees outside the camp, piercing through the already darkened woods. Then came the humming. Night after night, it sounded through the forest, its voice humming so confidently but yet so off tune, like a folk song from a land of limbo. The other men noticed it as well, and many sat awake at night next to the fire, holding their swords and spears closely, their eyes fixated on the trees. It wasn’t long before protest began to erupt amongst the camp’s inhabitants, many arguing that the expedition was a lost cause, and that it would be wise to simply cut our losses and depart back across the sea. 

After incessant hounding from the men, Frode eventually relented, his stubborn demeanor worn down from the lack of sleep and sustenance. He announced that we’d be departing from Markland within the week. The time leading up to our departure was spent hastily collecting our supplies and belongings, leaving the camp a hollow and empty husk. We returned to the coast where our longship still sat idle upon the shore in which we then prepared to set sail. After loading our belongings onto the ship, we all filed on, hoisting the sail and heaving the oars, we departed from the shore. 

The wind caught in the sail, carrying us farther into the horizon. A strong blizzard had set in by the time we had set off, and just as we had, I looked back upon the coastline, and there, standing amongst the trees, was the creature. Its titanic eyes fixated upon us as we sailed away from the shore. Only this time, it appeared to possess a toothless mouth, which was hung open so wide that its lower lip hung down to its knees, as if it were screaming. I did not inform any of the other men of this as they worked the oars through the water. 

I returned home in mid-winter, and when I had stepped upon the sweet and familiar ground that I knew as home, I knelt down and kissed the grass when I had disembarked onto the island. Frode had paid me a handsome sum of silver for my troubles before we parted ways. He also gave me Destin’s sword which he had presumed I would have wanted to have as a keepsake to honor his memory. Torsten had embraced me with a paternal affection when I returned, and just about everyone within the community had harped on me to tell them of my travels. They had thought that it was just like the great sagas, just as I did. 

A great adventure of slain beasts and plundered treasures. This was of course not the case. Even in the following years of having left Markland, my nights were plagued by nightmares of the creature, with its long, horrid fingers sinking themselves into the flesh of my friend as its insect-like eyes regarded me, as if to acknowledge me as its next victim. Of those I have spoken to about my experiences, all of which have only either offered up superstitious explanations or a sharp skepticism, writing my story off as a mere falsehood in an attempt to gain notoriety. I knew that whatever it was that I had encountered, and that had slew my dear friend, was not a spirit or a goddamned troll. 

It was simply not of this world, and there are certain corners of this earth where I believe such things can cross into our mortal plain. Once again, to anyone who may happen upon this book, do not go to Markland. Never return west. Only accursedness awaits all those who venture there.”

The journal ended there. My eyes peeled away from the packet and fixated onto a spot in the white wall in front of me as the events described in the translation played out in my head. The rest of the night was spent rereading the packet word for word, and when I had finished reading the journal’s contents for at least the hundredth time, the first bright rays of sunlight had poked through the blinds in front of the window. The following morning, I found Espen and Aurora along with the others gathered back in the dining room. Conclusively, they had not found anything else of interest back at the site with the EMS readings only uncovering the occasional discarded tin can. 

I saw that Johannes bore dark rings beneath his eyes and I wagered he’d not slept either. I presented the packet along with the original journal to Espen who took them both, thanking myself and Johannes before sticking the packet into a black covered binder he’d often keep close to himself when not out on the dig site, saying that he’d be sure to give it a read. He then explained that the artifacts would be turned over to Danish authorities for further analysis and that our work here was concluded, adding that our paychecks would be shipped to each of our addresses upon his return to Norway as well as all of our names being featured in whatever article or documentary that may come of our findings as per our contributions. The next night, we spent one last evening celebrating our discoveries, and while I had enjoyed myself, Sigmundur’s words still flashed in my mind even under the euphoric influence of alcohol. The following morning, I bid Espen and Aurora goodbye and told Johannes that I’d see him back in Maine before departing from Skúvoy via ferry and taking a flight back to Portland from Tórshavn.

When I returned home, my house seemed so empty, and barren compared to the mystic atmosphere of the Faroes. I spent the following days reminiscing of my experience, and of that journal. The exact location of Markland was not entirely clear, but it occurred to me that the modern state of Maine is not far from it if speculations that it lies near or around the Labrador coast can be believed to any extent. I recalled the last words of the journal: “Do not return to Markland. Never return west. Only accursedness awaits those who venture there.” I later received an email from Espen, 

“Austin O’Driscoll

I would like to once again thank you and Mr. Visser for helping out with the project. I went ahead and read the translated material, and I have to say I’ve never seen anything like it in my entire career. My own personal guess is that it was the product of a poet of sorts, perhaps inspired by the story of Beowulf at the time. The lack of any heroic themes is still highly unusual for Norse writings, and thus we can’t know for sure of course. On another note, your check should arrive in the mail later this month.

Perhaps it was like Espen suggested, but I had a staunch feeling within myself that what was contained within that journal was nothing short of truth. I had lived in a relatively rural part of Maine as a means of getting away from the constant racket of urban life. But now, on some nights I often find myself looking upon the tree line in the distance, lost in thought. And sometimes, I think I can see two almond shaped eyes staring back at me from the trees.

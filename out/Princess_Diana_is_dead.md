I'm so confused right now, and I'm hoping someone out there can explain what's happening.  I feel like I'm going crazy. 

So a few weeks ago I had a bad case of pneumonia that was finally responding to medicine. As I didn't feel like doing much, I had the TV on and there was a special about the life and death of Queen Elizabeth II. I mentioned to my husband that it was weird that no one was interviewing Princess Diana and he gave me the strangest look and asked me how they were going to do that? Summon her spirit? I laughed and told him they could probably just have a news crew in California talk to her, she gives interviews often enough. He asked me what I was talking about and said that she's dead. He even looked it up on his laptop for me and there are all these articles about her dying?! 

Now I'm not British, and I only occasionally follow the royal family,  but I know she didn't die in 1997. From what I remember she was in a car crash,  but survived. In fact, I remember her surving like 3 more weird "accidents" before she moved over here. 

There was a weird ski accident where she some how ended up off the course and almost went off a mountain, but grabbed a small tree at the last second. Another time the breaks went out in the car she was driving, but she managed to coast to safety. Then there was a bad plate of seafood that she didn't like the smell of and didn't eat. It turned out it was cooked wrong and would have made her, at best extremely ill and at worst killed her. The hype in the media each time another accident happened was hard to miss.  It was on every station for weeks.  

Then she moved to the US, become a citizen, and is currently the head of some organization that focuses on the mental health of people living with and recovering from diseases. I think she was even on Dancing with the Stars at one point.  I remember her photo in all the papers with her mascara running down her joyful face at both her son's weddings. I mean she was the reason Harry and Meghan moved to California. They live next door to her. 

At least I thought they did.  Now though, I can't find any of this information. It's like everything I remember happening had just vanished. 

I have small kids, and I've been ill,  so I was all ready to chalk this up to a weirdly specific dream, but then today my mom called. 

This first part of the conversation was normal, taking about my kids and such. Then she mentioned that her mom was looking forward to seeing them when we visited again.  Her mom, my grandma, died before I was born. Like 6 or 7 years before I was born. My mom was quite upset when I mentioned that and hung up shortly after.  Y'all I just looked on Facebook and not only are there pictures of my grandma from quite recently,  she has a Facebook page. I'm friends with her. 

The rest of my family is exactly the same,  just now my grandma is showing up in photos that she wasn't in before. There's pictures of her playing with my kids and smiling next to me at our families Memorial Day cook out. She wasn't there, I know she wasn't. I have never met her, but there we are in the photos smiling away. 

Its like the world is 95% as it's always been. There are a few odd things I'm noticing now that I'm looking for them. My dog won't leave my side when I'm home,  which is a little odd. He's usually always with my husband. One of our barn cats that disappeared several years ago, is back and the kids are acting like he never left. A girl from my high school, that I thought I remember talking to at our class reunion this past summer, apparently died a few years back in a hiking accident. 

Zac Efron appears to be alive, even though I remember him getting hit by a bus in London. The one that's really getting me is that Robin Williams is gone.  I just saw him in the live remake of Aladdin and it was amazing and now it's Will Smith? 

I don't know what to think anymore. Did I dream it all? I'm starting to question all my memories now. Does anyone else remember any of these things or is it just me?

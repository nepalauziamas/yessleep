Hello everybody, my name is David. I am a man and a husband and I enjoy spending time on Reddit just like you. At least, I used to. More recently it has made me feel uneasy and afraid.

This all started a couple of weeks back after curiosity got the better of me and I clicked on a link obviously related to what can only be described as "mega-filthy death porn", or possibly "mega filthy necrophilia porn" something like that. I honestly only clicked on the link because I thought there wouldn't be anything too bad on the internet, but I was wrong. I won't go into the details. I wouldn't want you to go through the same life-changing experience I did. After the fifth or sixth rotting anus I'd seen pounded into obliteration, I felt like all the light had gone out of my life. As if God had proven his existence to me, but only in so much as I could never feel his love. My every waking moment is now defined by the deep stillness of abject horror within me. My dreams are predominantly about sex with dead people.

Anyway, after that I began to notice some very different targeted ads pop up on Reddit. Rather than the usual offer of online therapy I started seeing things like "Push someone hard and earn $50". Now, I don't need the money, I'm incredibly rich, but curiosity got the better of me again and so I clicked on the ad.

It took me through to a website where I had to create an account and upload a video of me completing the request. There was no way I was going to document myself committing a crime for $50 on some creepy website. So I laughed it off.

Suddenly I noticed someone standing over me. I looked up from my phone. 

"Got any spare change?" Asked the hard-up looking man.

"No." I replied. "But hey, if you let me give you a shove right now and record it, I can give you $50?"

"What?"

I showed him my phone and he read through what was on the website.

"Alright, let's do it." He said.

With the phone set to record, I gave the man a shove. He was boney thin and I am a strong muscular man who often works out. He fell over awkwardly, cracking his head on the ground. Blood began to pool beneath him.

"Oh fuck." I said, thinking through the ramifications of what had just happened.

Almost immediately a notification came through on my phone with the message "Walk away now for $1000 and for this to stay secret." I didn't need the money, as I mentioned before I'm incredibly rich, as well as physically fit, but they had me by the balls. I was terrified with what they would make me do next. 

After dropping $50 by the guy's feet I walked away hoping no one else had seen me. I would need a new phone.

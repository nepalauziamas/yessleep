Back in 1995, while working as a bartender at a popular tourist spot in Waikiki, something strange happened over the course of three months that made me uneasy for a long time. It all began one morning on my commute to work from Kailua, where I lived before I found a place in Honolulu. I was listening to The Morning Commute on the radio, which played music and talked about the news, when the show glitches out for a second. I thought it was my car radio acting up, but then the show changed. It was still The Morning Commute, but the host wasn’t the same anymore. Before I had any time to listen to what he was saying, the static came back, and the old host returned.

&#x200B;

I was confused about this but forgot about it rather quickly. A few days later it happened again. This time, I paid closer attention to what the other host was saying, and I managed to catch a few words. He talked about a protest outside a new observatory on one of the islands. When I asked around about it at the bar no one knew what I was talking about. There wasn’t even supposed to be an observatory at that location. This continued to happen on and off for a few days, and the other host always talked about news that didn’t align with what was actually happening. My closest friend at the time didn’t believe me when I told her about it, and after convincing her I wasn’t joking, she suggested that I record the strange broadcast so that I could prove what I was saying.

&#x200B;

I accepted the challenge and set up my tape recorder in my car, and the next time it happened I managed to get a short clip of the other host’s voice before the signal cut out again. I played the recording for my friend, and she was just as baffled as I was. Before this stopped happening, I recorded several cassette tapes worth of the other host’s voice. After a while, it became easier to follow what he and his guests were talking about, and it all came to a horrifying end after which this stopped happening for good. 

&#x200B;

Although we were both troubled by what we heard, we assumed it must have been a hoax––a very elaborate one, considering the different voices and the subjects discussed––but we could never quite figure out how someone would go about faking something like this. The recordings ended up at my friend’s place, and after she tragically passed away after an illness, I lost track of them. Ever since around 2005, things in the news have occasionally reminded me of what we heard on that strange broadcast from the mid-’90s, but without the tapes, I’ve never been able to confirm anything.

&#x200B;

A few days ago, though, when I was going through some old boxes in my parent’s attic, I came across a box labelled "Kailua tapes." As soon as I saw the label, I thought I had finally found the tapes. They weren’t there, though. All I found were printed transcriptions of their contents. They had belonged to my friend, who had typed it all out for an article she was working on before she got sick. I don’t know how they ended up in my parent’s attic, but it’s possible they put them there together with some of my other things during the year I was mourning my friend. I wasn’t all there during that period, and a lot of things happened that are difficult to remember properly today. I took the box home and went through the pages one by one, and I was immediately transported back to 1995. 

&#x200B;

I was shocked by how accurate everything was. The other host talked about things that are happening in the world today, things that no one could have known about in 1995. Below, I’ve typed out the transcriptions of all the tapes. I’m not sure what to make of all this, but I thought I’d share it in case anyone else has any ideas.

**Original Host:** …let’s get this show on the road. Our first song of the day is "Pearly Shells" by Don Ho. I hope you're all ready to start singing along!

\[Pearly Shells plays for ten seconds before being interrupted by static.\]

**New host (Referred to as “Host” from here on):** Welcome back to The Morning Commute. I’m your host, John Fitzgerald, and we’ve got a lot to talk about today. First up, we’ve got a report from our correspondent on the scene of a protest that’s been going on for weeks now.

\[There is a sound of static for several seconds, then the audio becomes clearer.\]

**Correspondent:** Thanks, John. I’m here at the site of a new astronomical observatory that’s been under construction for a very long time now. The project has been controversial from the start, with many people concerned about the impact it will have on the environment. The protesters here say that the government is putting the interests of science ahead of the people.

**Host:** What’s the latest on the situation, Mindy?

**Correspondent:** Well––

\[The broadcast is interrupted by static.\]

**Original host:** …has been found not guilty of double murder in the deaths of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman. This is a stunning verdict, and many people are surprised by the outcome. Simpson was facing up to life in prison if convicted, but he will now go free. This case has been one of the most high-profile and divisive in America, and it’s sure to continue to be a source of debate for years to come––

\[Transcript of Tape 2. The audio is relatively clear but worsens over time.\]

**Host:** …ning Hawaii! You’re listening to The Morning Commute, and this is––as always––your host John Fitzgerald. We’ve got plenty of news and gossip for you today, but first, let’s check out the traffic report. Over to you Rick.

**Reporter:** Thanks, John. H-1 is moving smoothly this morning, no accidents to report. However, there is construction on the Pali Highway, so expect delays in that area. There’s also construction on the H-3, but it’s not causing any delays. You can expect construction on the H-2 to cause delays in both directions, so if you’re taking the H-2 this morning, be sure to give yourself some extra time. As always, please drive carefully!

**Host:** Thank you for that concise summation, Rick. In the news today, a new study shows that more people are moving to the suburbs than the city. The study shows that the number of people moving to the suburbs has increased by 5% in the past year. The number of people moving to the city has decreased by 2%. The study also shows that the number of people moving to the suburbs is increasing faster than the number of people moving to the city. This trend is expected to continue for the foreseeable future, and is in line with a similar, worldwide trend.

Some researchers have even gone so far as to call it a form of de-urbanization, a phenomenon commonly attributed to the pandemic of 2020 when people first started working from home in large numbers. Maybe it’s time to rename this show to The Morning Commute – From the Bedroom to the Living Room! 

In other news, there's a new trend taking over Oahu that's sure to get you snoring. It's called "snoorbing"! Apparently, the idea is to snore as loudly as possible in public places like the beach, park, or even in line at the grocery store. Some people are even using special devices to amplify their snores. It all started on social media, of course, and there's even a hashtag for it. Some people have voiced concerns that snoorbing could be disruptive, but most people seem to be finding it amusing. So, if you're looking for a new way to annoy strangers, give snoorbing a try! So far, the trend seems to be mostly confined to young people, but who knows? Maybe we'll all be snoorbing soon! I think I'll pass, though. My wife already tells me no one snores louder than I do! Now, let’s listen to the new single “Falling Star” by The Pineapple Junkies. The Pineapple Junkies are a local band here in Oahu, and this is their latest single. It’s a catchy tune with a great message. So, turn it up and enjoy!

**Host:** Aloha! The weather here in Oahu is gorgeous today! The sun is out and it’s about 82 degrees Fahrenheit. There’s a light breeze blowing, but nothing too crazy. Perfect weather to spend the day at the beach! Today, I’m joined by Ryan Harris, the author of the new novel Red Skies Over Yoshiwara. First off, congratulations on your new book! Can you tell us a little bit about it?

**Guest:** Thank you! Red Skies Over Yoshiwara is a historical fiction novel set in Japan during the Edo period. It tells the story of a young woman named Kikuko who is sold into the red-light district of Yoshiwara and the challenges she faces in trying to survive and escape her circumstances.

**Host:** Wow, that sounds like a really interesting and intense story. What inspired you to write it?

**Guest:** I’ve always been interested in Japanese history and culture, and I wanted to write a novel that would transport readers to another time and place. I also wanted to shine a light on the often-hidden history of Japanese women, who were often sold into prostitution or forced into arranged marriages.

**Host:** That’s definitely something that isn’t talked about enough. What do you hope readers will take away from your book?

**Guest:** I hope that readers will be transported to another time and place, and that they’ll come to understand the strength and resilience of the human spirit. Kikuko is an incredibly brave and determined young woman, and I hope her story will inspire others.

**Host:** Trump’s second term is bound to be just as controversial as his first. In his inauguration speech, he took shots at his predecessor, Joe Biden, for not doing enough to stop Russia from invading Ukraine and for failing to create more jobs. Trump also boasted about how he took back the presidency after Biden allegedly stole it from him. Following these statements, Trump went into some of the actions he plans to take during his second term in office. The most controversial of these is his plan to arm schoolteachers in order to prevent mass shootings, an issue that’s been at the forefront of the national conversation in recent years.

There were also a number of reports of violence and property damage, although the vast majority of protests were peaceful. In Washington, D.C., police used pepper spray and stun grenades to disperse a small group of protesters who were throwing rocks and bottles. There were also reports of fires being set and windows being broken. In New York City, protesters marched through the streets, chanting slogans such as "No Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA." In Los Angeles, demonstrators marched to City Hall, where they held a rally. And in Seattle, protesters blocked traffic and staged a "die-in" at Westlake Cent––

Ever since Sweden and Finland joined NATO, Russia has been beefing up its military presence in the area, and this latest development is sure to increase tensions even further. Trump’s re-election might also play a part, as Patrushev probably wants to show the new administration that Russia is still a major power to be reckoned with. We’ll keep you updated on this developing story as more information becomes available. In the meantime, stay safe and remember to keep an eye on the news.

This morning, Greta Thunberg tweeted, quote: "Starship is a massive waste of resources that could be used to combat the climate crisis. Musk’s obsession with space exploration is a distraction from the urgent task of addressing the climate crisis. We need to focus on investing in renewable energy, not sending people to Mars." End quote. We talked to Dr. Yvonne Jacobs, stationed at the University of Hawaii’s Mauna Kea observatory, about the potential impact of spaceflight on our planet.

The president has threatened to exit the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), a key arms control agreement between the United States and Russia. This comes as tensions between the two countries continue to rise, with Russia recently announcing plans to deploy nuclear-capable missiles to its westernmost territory in response to NATO’s expansion eastward. The START treaty, which was first signed in 1991, requires both the United States and Russia to limit their nuclear arsenals and bans the development of new nuclear weapons. It’s seen as a key part of maintaining global stability, and its collapse could have dangerous consequences. Trump has called it “insane” and “unacceptable” that Russia is allowed to have more nuclear weapons than––

The Carl Vinson is the flagship of the Carrier Strike Group 1, and it includes the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson, the guided-missile cruisers USS Lake Champlain and USS Philippine Sea, and the guided-missile destroyers USS Michael Murphy and USS Wayne E. Meyer. With us today we have professor of political science and former director of the Chinese Studies program at Georgetown University, Dr. Elizabeth Rodriguez.

**Host:** Dr. Rodriguez, thanks so much for being with us.

**Guest:** Thanks, John.

**Host:** So, China has been moving troops and equipment to the Taiwan Strait in what some are calling the largest mobilization of forces in the area in years. How do you interpret these actions by Beijing?

**Guest:** Well, I think there are a couple of things going on here. First, I think Beijing is trying to send a signal to both Taiwan and the United States that it is serious about reunifying Taiwan with the mainland. This is something that China has been talking about for many, many years, but I think they feel that under President Trump, who has been much more supportive of Taiwan than any previous U.S. president, they need to make a stronger push in this direction. Second, I think Beijing is also trying to take advantage of the fact that the United States is in a bit of a transitional period right now. We have a new administration that is still trying to get its bearings and put together a coherent China policy. And I think Beijing is trying to take advantage of that to push forward on some of its key priorities.

**Host:** Do you think the situation in Europe, with Russia behaving in a similar fashion toward Poland and Finland right now, has something to do with China feeling emboldened and taking this opportunity to kind of make its move on Taiwan?

**Guest:** I think that’s definitely a factor. I think Beijing is watching very closely what’s happening in Eastern Europe, particularly with regard to the buildup of Russian troops along the border with Poland and Finland. And I think they see that as an opportunity to try to take advantage of a distracted United States. So, I think the situation in Europe is definitely a factor here. But I also think that we need to remember that this is something that China has been wanting to do for a very long time. They’ve been gradually building up their military capabilities in the region. They now have a much more modern military than they did even ten years ago. And I think they feel that they’re in a position to finally make a move on Taiwan.

**Host:** What do you think are the implications of these actions by China for the United States?

**Guest:** Well, I think there are a couple of implications. First, I think it’s a very clear signal that the U.S.-China rivalry is here to stay, and that it’s going to be a very intense rivalry. I think we are going to see more and more confrontations between the United States and China, not just in the Taiwan Strait, but also in the South China Sea, in the East China Sea, and really all around the world.

\[Static for ten seconds.\]

**Host:** How do you think China will react to the arrival of the aircraft carrier group to the region?

But for now, it’s time to start your day with the news. Last night, a Chinese vessel reportedly fired upon a Taiwanese fishing boat, killing one fisherman and injuring three others. The incident took place in the disputed waters between Taiwan and China. Taiwan’s government has condemned the attack and has demanded an apology from China. China has not yet responded to the incident. It’s unclear what provoked the attack, but it comes at a time of increased tensions between China and Taiwan.

**Caller:** I’m just so upset that someone like Jordan B. Peterson is being allowed a platform at the Chaminade University. He’s just a bigoted, sexist, racist person and I can’t believe that the university would allow him to speak there.

**Host:** Well, it sounds like you don’t agree with his beliefs. I can’t say I do, either. But don’t you think that everyone has a right to free speech?

**Caller:** Free speech doesn’t mean that you can just say whatever you want without consequence. Peterson is a dangerous person, and I don’t think he should be given a platform to spew his hatred.

**Host:** I understand where you’re coming from, but I think we need to be careful about censorship. If we start censoring people because we don’t agree with them, then we’re no better than them.

**Caller:** I’m not saying we should censor him, I’m just saying we shouldn’t give him a platform. He doesn’t deserve one.

**Host:** What would you say to Peterson if you had the chance?

**Caller:** I would tell him that he’s a sexist, racist, bigoted person and that he doesn’t deserve a platform! It just feels like we’re moving in the wrong direction, you know. It’s 2025 for crying out loud! We’ve had enough of old white men spreading their alt-right ideology! I really think the university should reconsider their decision––

**Host:** We’re back. You’re listening to The Morning Commute, and we have some breaking news to share with you. A large explosion has been observed just south of the island of Taiwan. What we know so far is that earlier this morning, USS Lake Champlain, a guided-missile cruiser, was sailing in the area on a routine exercise when it detected what appeared to be a Chinese missile launch. The missile was tracked and intercepted by two SM-3 missiles fired from the ship.

\[A few seconds of static.\]

**Host:** ...okay, so unfortunately, it appears that the explosion was caused by the interceptor missiles detonating too close to the launch \[Inaudible\], resulting in significant damage to the Chinese vessel. We’re still waiting for more information, but it seems like this could escalate into a serious situation. We’ll keep you updated as we learn more. In the meantime, I’ve gotten in touch with Dr. Kamea Alapai, a local expert on Chinese military affairs, and he’s going to join us on the show over phone to help us understand what’s going on. Welcome to the show, Kamea.

**Guest:** Thank you for having me.

**Host:** So Kamea, can you tell us what you know about this incident?

**Guest:** Well, I don’t think anyone knows more than what’s been reported on the news so far, but if I would have to guess, I would say the damage to the Chinese vessel was unintended. I don’t think the US was trying to start a conflict, but accidents happen, and this could be a very serious one.

**Host:** But they fired first, didn’t they? They fired the missiles.

**Guest:** Yes, although I would caution that we don’t have the full picture of what transpired before the missiles were fired. But I think it’s possible that the US was acting in self-defense.

**Host:** But why would the Chinese fire a missile in the first place?

**Guest:** I don’t know. Maybe they were trying to send a message to the US. It might have been a warning shot. This is all speculation, of course, and again, I think it’s important to remember that we don’t have all the information yet.

**Host:** Kamea, thank you for joining us. We’ll be sure to have you back on the show as we learn more.

**Guest:** Thank you, John.

**Host:** I’m getting some worrying reports now about a tweet supposedly showing, either the initial explosion or another one. I’m watching it now. This is the first footage as far as... Okay, it looks like someone is filming with their phone. Not sure if they’re standing on the mainland or on the island, might be on a boat. Oh my God! That’s not a conventional explosion! The-The footage shows a flash, a giant eruption of water, and a shock wave that knocks the person filming to the ground! I’m not sure what’s going on, but it looks like this incident in the Taiwan Strait just got a lot more serious. If this footage is real, and I have no reason to doubt it, then we could be looking at a major disaster. I’m no expert, please keep that in mind listeners, but that looked a lot like a tactical nuke. It’s trending on Twitter, and yet there’s still no official word from the US government. I’ll keep you updated as we learn more.

Earlier today, a Chinese missile was fired at and struck the USS Lake Champlain and surrounding vessels. It appears they used a tactical nuke. Can you believe it? A nuke! This is an act of war and we will not stand for it. We are currently assembling a coalition of nations to respond to this aggression and we will not rest until China is made to pay for what they’ve done. We will not allow them to get away with this. Thank you.

It sounds like he’s ready to go to war with China–– \[Static for one minute.\] …and social media is exploding with horrifying footage from what appears to be the mainland of China where the US might have reta- \[Static for two minutes.\] ...coming in and out, but it seems the US has launched a counterattack. I’m seeing footage of massive explosions, but the context is unclear. I can’t even tell if it’s happening in China or in Taiwan. I fear the worst. With us now, for the second time today, is Dr. Kamea Alapai, a local expert on Chinese military affairs. Kamea, can you tell us what you know about the US counterattack?

**Guest:** I would say the US is retaliating with overwhelming force. The situation is out of control at this point.

**Host:** What do you think will happen next?

**Guest:** I don’t know. This is a grave situation. I think we could be looking at a full-scale war. It’s hard to say, but I think anything is possible at this point.

**Host:** I see. And what does this mean for our island, or for Hawaii in general?

**Guest:** Well, if a war does break out, I think it’s safe to say that Hawaii will be caught in the middle. We could be looking at a lot of damage, or even worse. I don’t think anyone knows for sure what will happen, but it’s definitely not going to be good.

**Host:** Kamea, thank you for joining us. The White House just tweeted that Trump will be making a televised address to the nation in ten minutes. We’ll be sure to have that for you, listeners, as soon as it happens.

**Guest:** Thank you.

\[Static for five minutes.\]

**Host:** It appears the televised address has been cancelled. The president has boarded Air Force One and is en route to an undisclosed location. We’re not sure what’s going on, but it seems like things are about to get a lot worse. People from what appears to be Nebraska are tweeting photos of what looks like ICBMs being launched. If these photos are confirmed to be real, it means that the US is now attacking the mainland of China with nuclear weapons. I-I’m hearing air sirens right now. Where’s the official information! People are panicking, I don’t-I don’t know what to do. Okay, we’re getting an emergency broadcast now. I’ll play it. I-I don’t know what more to say. This is-This is a nightmare. This is––

\[Distinct voices and air sirens can be heard in the background, then the broadcast ends.\]

**EAS:** \[A several seconds long beep can be heard on the audio\] This is an emergency broadcast. Two missiles have been launched toward the state of Hawaii. This is not a test. Please take shelter immediately. Repeat, this is not a test. Please take shelter immediately. This is an emergency broadcast. Two missiles have been launched toward the state of Hawaii.

**Original host:** …just listened to Fantasy by Mariah Carey. What a great song to start the morning commute! Thanks for tuning in. I’m your host, Linda, and you’re listening to The Morning Commute. Today, we’re going to be talking about some of the best beaches in Oahu. If you have any suggestions, feel free to call in––

I’m terrified about the prospect of a nuclear war. I can’t stop thinking about the devastation it would cause and how many people would be killed. I’m feeling so anxious and scared right now. I wish there was some way to prevent it from happening, something we could all do to stop it.

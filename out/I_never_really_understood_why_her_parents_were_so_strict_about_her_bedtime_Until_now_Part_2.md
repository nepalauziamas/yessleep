So, I decided to go back and give it one more try with Sarah, I didn’t really want to, but the money was just too good to pass up, and I thought, its only for a few weeks anyway, just get on with it. I know I complain a lot about my job and it may seem easy, but you don’t realize what it's like for me. You would think looking after a child that does everything for herself is easy, but it's not; it's draining, by the time I get home every night I feel exhausted and end up going straight to bed. I don’t know why I get so tired, but I know it has something to do with Sarah.  

I really tried to make a real go at it this time, not that I didn’t last time, I was actually really good to Sarah at first, well I tried to be, but she had a way of waring me down, I can’t explain it. There is just something about her that makes me feel so angry. I know I may seem like a bitch but I'm not, it's just her and her asshole family that made me that way. They act like they are so caring, always calling to neighbors with gifts, kiss asses. All they talk about is their charity work that they have done overseas, now they want to start here, they even asked me to volunteer, I said no fucking way. They might have had everyone else fooled but not me, I could clearly see they were hiding something from the start, no one is that nice. Anyways I wasn’t going to make the same mistake as last time, so I set up some ground rules before going back,  

1. I wanted my trip paid for up front; no strings attached. 

2. Always have someone home by 8:15 at the latest. 

3. NO weekends or any other form of overtime, set hours only. 

4. Talk to Sarah about acting so weirdly and make sure she fully understands the rules. 

5. If any of these rules are broken, I walk and still get paid in full. 

They agreed to my demands instantly without hesitation. Apparently, they were just happy to have me back. They are so fake, they never really gave a shit, they were just using money to control me.  

Things got off to a bad start, I had the flu and it had been slowly getting worse. So, by that first day back I was really sick. I thought about staying home, but I wouldn’t have gotten paid for it, so I thought I would lie on their couch for the day and get paid for it instead. I wouldn’t risk getting anyone sick normally, but I think it was that bitch that made me sick in the first place when she bit me. Her parents didn’t seem to care when I walked in coughing anyways, so fuck it. That day I was actually happy she was so independent, and I didn't have to do a whole lot for her, not that I wouldn’t, I did ask, but all I got was, “I'm fine” as usual. 

After a while I thought I need to stop feeling sorry for myself and decided to make a real effort with Sarah and hopefully build some sort of bond. But it wasn’t easy, she always found a way to piss me off. I realized it wasn’t just her anymore, everyone seemed to be pissing me off. Sometimes I put it down to the stress from looking after her. What else could it be, I wasn’t like that before I started that shitty job. Other times I thought it was Sarah playing mind games with me, just to fuck with me. But I convinced myself that it was paranoia and got on with things. 

This time I was not going to give up no matter how hard she made things, and she did make things hard. One time I sat with her and tried helping with her drawings, even though they were weird, but she just threw me a look. When I tried talking to her about it, she started getting snappy with me, so I sat back down on the couch. When I looked up, she was staring at me with an unsettling grin, the little psycho. I tried taking her to the park another time, but it did not go well, all she did was complain and when we got to the playground, she just stared at the other children and refused to do anything. I just wanted her to have fun, so I took her over to the slide, and urged her to go on it, but when she got to the top of the ladder, she freaked out and ended up knocking a little boy off. He nearly broke his arm, I was so embarrassed. 

As the days went on, I tried everything but no matter what I did, it just wasn’t enough. It really started to get to me, and it was getting harder and harder to be nice to her. I don’t know how she always managed to bring out the worst in me and the more time I spent with her the angrier I became. I couldn’t just blame Sarah; her parents knew what they were doing when they hired me. They tricked me with all their kindness and generosity. I should have listened to my gut, but it is too late now. 

After all that time trying to befriend Sarah, it wore me down too much and I wanted to leave again, but I made a deal with them and wouldn’t get fully paid if I left unless they broke the rules, which of course, they didn’t. I decided to try talking to them about what I was going through and said I was thinking about leaving, even without the money. They begged me to have dinner with them that Saturday night before making my decision, they said they had something for me that might change my mind. Knowing them I was sure it was some extravagant gift, so I decided to go, even though it was the weekend, and I would not get paid for it. 

Sarah must have overheard us talking because she was excited, which I thought was odd, she had never acted that way before. When I was going out the door, she handed me a drawing of me and her at the park, I am not being mean but that was the worst thing I had ever seen. There was no way I could show that shit to my mom this time, so I threw it in the bin. When I got home that night, I felt so angry, I have no idea why, I ended up taking it out on my mom and dad. 

I felt bad but I just couldn’t control myself, I could have put it down to stress, tiredness or even the flu, but I know it had something to do with that family. They were in my head somehow. even in my sleep that bitch Sarah was there, haunting my dreams. I tried to confide in my parents, but they didn’t give a shit, they just told me to get over it. It is easy for them to say that, they didn’t have to go through what I went through. Even my friends didn’t believe me, they just thought I was making excuses so I could go hang out with them. 

The day before the “special” dinner, Sarah was acting weird, well... weird for her, she started talking to me like a real child and even seemed normal at times. She asked me to take her to the park again. To be honest I was really happy about it, I felt a since of accomplishment, I had finally gotten through to her. At the park things couldn’t have gone better, she started to mix with other children and when we got home, we watched tv for a while then played some board games. For the first time I was actually enjoying being around her, it was amazing. When I told her parents, they seemed a bit surprised for a moment, but then they got excited and started hugging each other. They even gave me a very generous tip for my troubles. 

When I woke up that Saturday morning, I didn’t feel any better, I could barely get out of bed, but I didn’t care, I was just happy with how good things had gone with Sarah the day before. This was the first time I was actually looking forward to seeing her and couldn’t wait for dinner, it was a nice feeling. For most of that day I stayed in bed, I wanted to be well rested for dinner that night. At around 7 o clock I made my way over. Walking up to that door I felt proud for once, I didn’t even care about the gift, I was just happy to have gotten through to Sarah. 

When the door opened Kate was standing there, I had never seen her look so happy before, she called me in for a hug she squeezed me so tight I thought she was going to break a rib. Then Sarah came running out of the kitchen and jumped into my arms, Liam followed behind her with a big smile on his face. I was really surprised and did not know how to react; they had never acted like that around me before. They called me into the sitting room and offered me some wine, which I badly needed at that point, and we started talking. Most of the conversation evolved around me and what my plans were for the future, I tried asking them about Sarah and where they came from, but they always turned their attention back to me. 

Usually, Liam did most of the talking, and Kate would give the short answers, but not tonight, it seemed like he was avoiding me, the only time we really talked was when he offered me more wine. which I suppose was enough because by dinner I started to feel a bit tipsy. 

As I sat down to eat, I noticed there was no place set for Sarah, I didn't say anything about it, I thought maybe she had eaten earlier or something. When I looked at Liam, he seemed nervous, he kept fidgeting with the cutlery, while Kate was quietly smiling over at me, with a strange look in her eyes, almost like she was waiting for me to do something. But I had no idea what. They both clearly had something on their minds but were afraid to say, and it was making me very uncomfortable.  

To break the silence, I said, "Liam, how is your job going?" Usually, he loved to talk about work, so I was expecting him to go on and on about it and take the attention off me for a while. 

He stopped eating, slowly put down his fork, swallowed what was in his mouth and replied, "uuumm, fine" while staring down at his plate, never even glancing in my direction.  

Kate quickly jumped in, "Don't mind him, he's just not used to company at dinner, you usually can't shut him up" she said giggling. Then she turned the conversation back to me again and asked whether I liked college and if I ever thought about moving. I found it an unusual line of questioning, but I suppose they were an unusual kind of people. 

The only person that was acting even close to normal was Sarah, she was just sitting across from me, coloring as usual, every now and then she would look over at me and smile. 

It got so uncomfortable that I soon gave up on making any attempt at conversation and put my full attention into finishing my food as fast as I could. Which was not easy, since the food seemed off and left a strong metallic like after taste in my mouth. I don't know why I finished it all, I suppose I was just eating to fill the awkward silence and got carried away. When I looked up, I noticed everyone was staring at me smiling, even Sarah, I was sure I had food on my face or something, so I picked up a napkin and started wiping. But they just kept staring at me with what looked like excitement in their eyes, I started to get creeped out.  

I coughed quietly to get their attention, and they all snapped out of it. Then Liam started to speak, “Sarah do you want to help me in the Kitchen with dessert honey?” They went to the kitchen, while Kate started asking me about my parents, and how close we were. As we were talking, I started to feel dizzy, and my stomach became ill, I told Kate, she said I must have drunk a bit too much and asked me if I needed to lie down. I looked down at my watch, it was nearly 9, I panicked and tried to warn Kate, but she said it was fine and not to worry about it. Then Liam walked in with a large plate and laid it down Infront of me, but it was empty. I was confused and a little bit worried, so I tried to leave, but when I stood up my legs became weak, and I fell back onto the chair. Liam grabbed me before I fell any further.  

I am not entirely sure what happened next, I must have been drifting in and out of consciousness. All I remember is flashes and I don’t know how much of this was actually real, if any, but I pray it was all one big nightmare, because if not. I am fucked. As Liam was holding me up, I heard “ding” from a clock, Kate was standing behind Sarah with one hand on each of her shoulders, like she was trying to restrain her. The clock “dinged” again; Sarah quickly became agitated and started to squirm. “Ding” she screamed uncontrollably, her voice going from a deep earthy growl to a high pitch screech that made my eardrums vibrate, I thought they were going to burst. Before I blacked out Sarah’s face started to become distorted, her mouth seemed as if it was getting ripped apart from ear to ear, and her eyes seemed like they were getting pushed back into her head.  

The next thing I remember was Sarah lying face first on the table, her parents were both staring at me singing that creepy song, when they finished Sarah sat up and they started clapping. She looked demonic and started laughing maniacally, with a monstrous grin on her face, while jumping up and down on the chair, violently pounding on the table with her fists, I blacked out again. The last thing I remember was Sarah standing over me, her face no more than a few inches from mine, I could feel someone holding my head up, but I am not sure who it was. Then she opened her mouth unbelievably wide, what I saw I couldn’t even begin to describe, but I can tell you this, I will never forget it, I was sure it would be the last thing I'd ever see. 

When I woke up, I was in Liam's car and he was driving me home, I looked at the time, it was 11 o clock, he told me I was drunk and passed out, at the time I believed him, and apologized for my behavior. It was only the next day when the memories, if they were actually memories, came flooding back, that I started to worry. I didn’[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/vc5we5/i_never_really_understood_why_her_parents_were_so/)t really believe any of that was real at first how could I, until I started noticing unusual changes. I am always hungry no matter how much I ate. I barely sleep, when I do, I only dream of horrible things, that are too disturbing to describe. Also, I feel a darkness inside of me, and it wants to come out, it frightens me, and it is getting harder to fight it. Before I started looking after that bitch, I was a different person, I was always in a good mood, never complained and was always full of energy. 

Looking back, I realize I started changing after my first day with Sarah, I came home in a bad mood, and it steadily got worse, now I am afraid to be around anyone in case I bite their heads off. I spend most of my time in my room alone, I even canceled my trip, even though Liam dropped off an envelope with my full pay, his phone number and asked me to ring. My parents were not happy about them giving me full pay for work I never did, so they tried to return it. But they were not home and the house was empty, the weird thing is nobody knows where they went.  

To be honest I am happy to be rid of them, but I would have liked to know what they did to me before they left. I had no choice but to try to forget what happened that night. I tried to get rid of any reminders of that family, starting with the drawings. But As I was looking through them, I realized that I was slowly changing in every one of her drawings, then I remembered that the last drawing she done for me, I had the same monstrous face as she had in that “dream.” I wonder if she was trying to prepare me for something or maybe even warn me of what was to come. Then again maybe it was all in my head and that was just a crazy dream.

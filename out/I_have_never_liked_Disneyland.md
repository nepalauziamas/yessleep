I have never liked Disneyland. And I know what you’re thinking. No, it's not the rides, no it's not the shows, and no it's not the food.





It’s the *mascots.* Something about a silent somebody, in a creepy, essentially expressionless costume, just, staring at you. It creeps me out beyond reason. And isn’t it funny how my family is a *big* Disney family. We go there at least every month, and you better believe every birthday theme was Disney. When I was younger I’d even cry every time we would go to ‘the happiest place in the world’. At least now as an adult I don’t have to go as much. But what do you know, it’s my sister's birthday, so here we are, at Disneyland. I got through most of the day just fine, but at one point, something on the loudspeakers triggered a large crowd, and I got seperated from my family. I walk in the direction I saw them last, and eventually I end up at a closed section of the park. I turn around, and there he is. Someone in a Goofy costume, just, standing there. 

“Uh, can I help you?”

No response.

“Are you on break, or, am I not where I’m supposed to be, or…”

He takes a step towards me.

“Hey, stay back, d-don’t come closer.”

The nervousness in my voice was as clear as day. For a while no one says anything. He’s just standing there.

“Uh, well, I’m going to go now, so-”  
He immediately starts sprinting towards me, and in one of his hands I see a knife.

I immediately scream, and duck under the ‘stay out’ tape and just run. I don’t know where I’m going, but I book it as fast as I can. As I run further into the park, I begin to see splatters of blood, everywhere. At this point the adrenaline has worn off, and I’m getting really tired, my legs are on fire and my lungs are burning. I look behind me and see him still as fast as ever. I slowly start giving up, hoping he just kills me quick, when I hear a thud, I turn, and see him face first on the ground. I get a burst of energy as I sprint away, and I run for 20 seconds before I nearly collapse. 

I scurry inside an abandoned shop and hide underneath the counter. I hear the sound of padded feet run by me. Then, I hear footsteps in the stall next to me. Then, those padded feet come up to my stall. I see his shadow appear and look over. I hear his heavy breathing as he looks in my stall for a while. Eventually he walks away. I look over the counter and see his back coated with blood. After what felt like an eternity, I ran out of the abandoned part of the park, past all the rides, straight to the exit, and I drove home. 

Safe to say, I don’t like Disneyland,

And I *don’t* like mascots

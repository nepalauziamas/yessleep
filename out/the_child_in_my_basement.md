(I want to apoligise for the bad layout of this story, im only a new reddit writer, Thanks)

I first noticed something was off when I bought some crackers and 3 hours later they were gone. I didn't know if i had unconsciously eaten them or not. I had decided to ignore, but i shouldnt have. 

Two weeks later i went to the bathroom and noticed my shower was wet. Obviously a shower is wet, but i had a shower the night before. Thats when i started to feel a bit uncomfortable. I decided to set up cameras around my house to see if someone was breaking in and using my facilities. That day, i saw on the cameras a small little boy sneaking into my pantry to steal some food. He looked around 8 years old and very skinny. As i watched the video footage i saw that he was coming from my basement. The thing is, i never go into my basement. I use it to store all my furniture that wont get any use. So after building up the courage, i ventured down to the basement to try find this child... 

I slowly went down the stairs and flicked the light switch on, the dimly lit light shone over my head. In the corner of the basement hiding behind a storage box, i saw him. He looked so malnurished it broke my heart. 

"are you okay?" i whispered, trying not to scare him. I could see that he was shaking. "im c-c-cold" he muttered back, his sweet inncoent voice shaking from the lack of clothes to keep him warm. "I have some blankets up stairs, do you want to come up?" i asked. "o-ok" he said back. He slowly crawled out from behind the box and i took him upstairs. I made him a cup of hot chocolate and game him a nice big blanket. I put on some cartoons while i tried to figure out what to do. I didnt want to call Social Services because ive heard of some terrible things about it. But i couldnt just keep him here, he might have a family. I went into my room to call my mum to get her advice. But before i could dial her number, i looked in the relfection of the mirror infront of me and saw the little boy standing there with a knife in his hand. "OHMYGOD! you scared me" i yelled trying to catch my breathe. "Whare are you doing with that" i said slowly walking over to him. As i reached out to grab the knife off of him he sliced my wrists. The cut was huge and i dropped to the ground screaming as blood flowed out of the deep wound. Crying i reached for my phone to call an ambulance. 

"911, What is the emergency" The woman asked. "Help! im bleeding out i was attacked" i said, crying and screaming in agony. "What is your address?" she asked. "3569 Greenland Boulevard" i yelled.

5 minutes later the ambulance and police showed up. The last thing i remember is being carried into the ambulance on a stretcher, everything went black after that. I woke up to the sound of the heart machine beeping, my mum holding my hand. "Mum? what happened?" i asked, confused. "You are at the hospital Ella, the kid attacked you" she said, her calm voice soothing my nerves. "Oh, all i wanted to do was help him" i said, tears filling my eyes. "Thats ok honey, hes in juvie now" she said. "Are you sure?" i asked. "Yes my darling, your safe now" she said back. 

But when she left to get the nurse, i turned my ehad to the curtain and there he was, smiling at me with the knife in his hand. Still covered in my blood...

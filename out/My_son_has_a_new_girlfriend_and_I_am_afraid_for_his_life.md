PART 1

My son, Sam, started dating Lily six months ago. At first she was lovely. Within two months I was positive she was the one he would spend the rest of his life with. She always wore the kindest smile and was the first to offer help cooking, cleaning, or grabbing groceries when she visited. Thought she was quite timid and shy at first, the more she warmed up to me the more I could see how lovely all of her quirks were. She had a loud, rumbling laugh that didn’t quite suit her, and she always organized her colourful candies into their assigned colour groups.

The third month her demeanour changed. She began to act distant. Instead of enjoying time with my son around our home as she originally did, they often went out, which wouldn’t be odd; except she was extremely secretive about where they were going.

Once, as I was hopping out of the shower, I heard them getting ready to leave for yet another rendezvous. I scurried down the stairs to catch up with them before they left.

“Where are you off to?” I asked, but was hit once again with an exchanged glanced between Sam and Lily before Sam said,

“Not sure yet, just maybe a drive. I’ll see you later.”

It was something about the look Lily gave him before he spoke; it was almost pleading, and aggressive, maybe, and it created a pit in the bottom of my stomach. That’s when I began to realize something wasn’t right with this girl.

At the end of the fourth month, I finally convinced the two of them to join me for dinner. Lily spent the majority of the visit picking through her plate, eyes fixated on the table. She did, however, offer to help me clean up afterwards. Which I thought was kind, until I noticed her dazing off while washing one of my large kitchen knives. 

At one point she simply held it in her hands, rotating it, admiring it, before slowly, demonically looking up at me. As soon as she noticed me staring, her eyes fell back to the knife. She pretended to continue polishing and shining it, though you could already see a reflection in its polished blade 

“I’ll finish it off, thank you for helping!” I insisted, snatching the knife from her. Her eyes, they spoke of everything she refused to say, and it was terrifying. The pit in my stomach returned, only this time, instead of angst, it was dread, seeping through my bones and arteries, filling me with an anxiety I have never experienced. 

“Are you sure? I really don’t mind-“

“No, no, it’s really alright!” I said.

She shrugged and wandered off to Sam’s room. I felt at ease until I overheard her on the phone later that evening, as Sam showered in the bathroom next door.

“I think she knows,” Lily said in a hushed voice, “I don’t want her to be on to me, it’ll ruin everything.”

My jaw dropped, all of my suspicions confirmed. She’s plotting something, something awful, and she knows I know.

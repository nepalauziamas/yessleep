God is only a title... That was something I used to believe but I have been to the end of the multiverse ... the end of time and the very end of all things... Ok I know it sounds ridiculous however it's all true and we will all have to experience this hell that I was able to visit. My main studies are in quantum mechanics and I currently have a private quantum computer I use to run these theoretical designs for space and time travel. Recently after about seven hundred runs, I was able to get a theoretical machine design. This required all of the money I have been saving up as I wanted to get this project off the ground. 

So a couple of nights ago I finally finished the device the computer told me can visit a "Microverse" when I ran more tests the computer did seem like it was spouting nonsense. Somehow the entire microverse and multiverse are made of one and zeros like coding or mathematics. Which makes Max Tegmark's theory... a law? Anyways, When I kept running tests it errored out... It started spouting things like "I will become metaphysical" which made no sense considering it. This didn't stop me... 

The device I made was just a belt but it created a bubble out of anti-matter which allowed me to "shrink" to an impossible size. At first, I thought it was bullshit but I leaped fate, attached the belt to my waist, and fired it up. At first, nothing seemed to happen however I felt the world shift and I was shrinking down at an impossible speed. As I got smaller and smaller beyond atoms, electrons, neutrons, and even quarks. As I shrunk past the quarks to the point that they looked like the size of the sun I started to see something smaller that was getting larger and larger. 

Within mere moments this object was coming to light... It was a sphere with galaxies... whole universes beyond quarks in size. As I kept shrinking I saw the whole universe become larger and larger until I was down to atoms in this new universe then I shrunk even more. It was then I noticed nothing but grey space. Nothing was smaller than me as I was infinitesimal at this point. I started to see numbers and equations floating in the air as if the very foundation was the mathematics of this universe. 

It was then I could feel my very body being ripped apart piece by piece turning into words. Every inch of me I can feel being violently ripped apart. No matter what I did I couldn't stop it... screams were muffled and eventually I was nothing but a floating consciousness. Watching the words disappear into the grey void. Once I floated there I felt true despair... It felt as if I was experiencing true loneliness for the first time and this went on for what felt to be centuries before two large black hands wrapped themselves around my chest and dragged me downward. As I plunged deeper into what I named "The Grey" I saw more universes however all of the math equations I saw were counting down further and further into negative numbers. Beyond transfinite and large cardinals which would represent the consistency strength of Berkeley cardinals. This was what I called the negative verse. A verse like ours but inside "Negative Existence" which is both existing and nonexisting via ontological parasitical logic that is. 

As I kept getting dragged downward I was able to recall the world to.... bleed ink into a black void., I recalled, attached I struggled my best to not be brought into this void of nothing but no matter my struggles I was forced into the darkness. I closed my eye knowing this was my end but to my surprise, I was let go and was floating in the inky-like substance. It was thick and cold. Oddly enough as  I floated in this pool I noticed my hands and body were back however I felt different. As if It was being drained more by the second. As I floated there I looked around and saw... other bodies but they were just staring into the air somewhere under the ink completely but most floated in this goop. It didn't take long before I grew too tired to move and lay there. However, unlike the others, I was sinking deeper and deeper into the ink. I couldn't even struggle even when the ink filled my longs and burned my eyes. I felt trapped in my body and helpless. I kept sinking until I hit the bottom where I was the only one there... at least that I could feel. I was just surprised I didn't die from drowning. 

As I lay there in immense pain suffering while being unable to move all I could do is think of how much it was a mistake to seek knowledge where no human should travel. In my infighting, I felt another pair of large hands grab me and dragged me through the floor... I was being dragged by an unknown creature but I was glad I could escape one way or another from feeling like I was being perpetuated drowned. It was almost instant as  I was ripped into a new area. This one was just a waiting room. Filled with zombified creatures and humans alike. Some look like normal joes but there were unspeakable eldritch horrors in the room sitting in these chairs. The chairs were named and were all different and unique. It went from Barry and Alan to Y... something.... his name escapes me but there was Son Wukong as well... I thought to myself if these could be the real versions from the books I would read but ... that couldn't be possible... could it? Anyways, I shook my head and kept walking through this impossible large-sized room. 

The room itself had off-white wallpaper that was moist to the touch and smelled of mildew. Above me was a series of well-spaced fluorescent light bulbs that would flicker at uneven timings and constantly buzzed in a low humming tone. I kept looking around until I was greeted by a small but uncanny creature. This thing had no face other than a mouth with a crooked smile and jagged teeth. It held out this piece of paper that had my chair number and name. In the blink of an eye, I was teleported to the seat in question. I sat down and no matter what I could do I couldn't get comfortable and kept tossing and turning but never could find where I was just ok. This felt like hell truly... I sat there without knowing for the passing of time and watching random people like the mass of tentacles that was ... yog..... something. I can't remember to be honest who it was. but they were being escorted into a door that appeared in front of them never to be seen again. The anxiety of waiting for my unknown demise kept me in a constant state of fear. 

As I sat there waiting for my end I had time to think of my past and how I would change my own life and the way I am heading if I somehow survive this ordeal... I was mid-thought when the same "doorman" greeted me from earlier and I was escorted through a door that seemed to have materialized out of nowhere. As I walked through the door I was sent to an old-looking kingdom that was covered in fungus and rusty metal. I walked through the town square where all of the people were wearing old victorian gowns with plague masks covering their faces and somehow woven into their skin. 

As I was being escorted closer to the castle I notice free-floating spores that filled the air getting thicker and thicker and making it harder to breathe so I covered my mouth with my t-shirt and kept walking and following the gilded path. I got to the large wooden door that was the castle door. Walking in there was a long red carpet leading to a beautiful marble and gold throne that was clean however there was a thing sitting on the throne. It looked to be a large, rustic knight's armor covered in fungus. The thing had no head but where the head would be was a large cluster of fungus that was writhing and pulsating. It didn't speak but sent out thoughts that I and the unfortunate creature in front of the king could hear. 

The King: You Yo... is standing trial in front of my court as your story has come to an end. I have chosen to consume you and your narrative instead of allowing you to reside in my palace. You may now rest. 

I watched in horror as this impossible-sized creature get covered in fungus and swallowed up. I had written his name down before he was consumed but it seemed his name was retroactively removed from my notepad. Oddly enough I wrote down H.P Lovecraft as the creature's original author but I can no longer find mentions of his name anywhere. Sorry I digress, After the being was consumed by the fungus I was being drawn in by an unseen force. I floated across the ground and stood where the creature once stood. The king spoke to me. 

Headless King: Why are you here? You still have a living story... what allowed you to come to this realm unscathed? 

Me: I ... built this belt and used the schematics from a computer I had. It allowed me to shrink smaller and smaller until I arrived in a weird ink ocean. 

Hanged King: You made it to Inkwell without the expiration of your story? Interesting... however...

A blinding white light flashed and covered the whole room. I had to cover my eyes but when It stopped a strange being which looked to be an astronaut was standing in front of me. 

Auren: Be a not afraid child. You have come here with my help I wanted to show people this place and its existence. 

Headless King: Auren... you have some nerve coming to my domain after releasing Brian from my grasp. I see you brought some readers though... Are you going to be taking this person too and leaving these readers with me? 

Auren: Yes, this person has a name... his name is Kevin and he must not die today but he has inhaled some of your spores so very soon he will be. 

Me: Ayo... what the actual fuck? How do you know my name?

Auren: Kevin... I wrote you. This is your story in which I narrate much like the readers who are reading your story unfold. It's all a part of my plan. I will send you home now Kevin but I would recommend saying your goodbyes as you are not long for the world. 

Me: I have so many questions... who are you and what is that thing. 

Auren: Ah yes, I am the Absolute. This being is the opposite or the negative version of me. As I am absolute creation they are absolute end. All stories end with yours, the readers, and even mine eventually end. And the Headless King will consume all. 

Headless King: Kevin, I know you feel this is unfair however you didn't choose this much like the readers who are reading your story didn't fully choose to read your story. However, all things will end. Take care of yourself and be happy knowing you know how this all ends. No one gets that luxury. 

And within a split second, another light flashed in front of me and I woke up here at my desk in front of my computer. IT felt like a dream but... I have ink all over me and I have been coughing up small green spores. It may be too late for me but you still have a chance... run and stop reading this... Never make my mistake or you too will end up like me...

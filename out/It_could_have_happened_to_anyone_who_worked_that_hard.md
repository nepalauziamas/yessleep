From the jump, I’ve always known I wanted to be the greatest writer in history.  To me, it always seemed like merely a matter of dedication.  Discipline.  Desire.  Drive.  It was as simple as making the decision and then refusing to stop, no matter what anyone else thought.  So to me, it was never a surprise that I outworked everyone else.  The fact that the rest of the world spent the entire time judging the work I did under all my different Aliases, instead of actually writing their own great works of art, didn’t really surprise me.  You’re probably rolling your eyes right now, but if you saw the full ls- list… it’d change your life forever when you realize one person did all that.  Twain.  RhiAnna.  Anna Del -V.  Chuck.  Charles.  Charlemagne.  Poe.  Hermione.  JK.  D.B. Cooper.  King.  Hoffman.  R.L.  Stine.  Merlin.  Lancelot.  Alexander The Great.  AoC.  Legolas.  Achilles.  The Library of Alexandria.  Gandalf.   Vika.

But I knew, unless I came out of the closet, and traded in my anonymity, if I tried to tell anyone any of it on the low, they’d never believe me.  After all, they worship these names like gods, and they spit on a girl like me.  Yet the truth remains, they all spawned from my pen.  Will, Leo, and many more that you’d consider the greatest figures in history felt like pen pals to me, my friends through time that I felt actually existed the same you now do, except they’re just my imaginary friends from when I was 2, 3, & 4 years old… so I was the only one on a first name basis with them.  To you, they’re Shakespeare & Leonardo Da Vinci.  To me it says, kid you were 4 years old that summer you created all Billy’s work, and you tagged yourself as the blue Ninja Turtle meaning it’s true, you’re the winner.  So the truth is in the conspiracy theories, except the full truth would sound so crazy to the rest of the world that I never even bothered to write it down.  You wouldn’t have believed one pen did it all.  Hell, you probably still won’t but that doesn’t change the truth.  I really did it.  I made this subreddit too, so I had a safe space to share my story without it getting deleted or me getting through in a psych ward because nobody bothered to ask the government who really penned it all.  I’m the girl who wrote Malia Obama.  The one who put Hussein in the middle of Barack Obama.  The girl who made the barracks, Sarah Kerrigan.  Jodi.  Yet here I am, locked up, exactly as I wrote it.  I’m QA.  I made Shutter Island.  System of a Down.  Rage Against The Machine.  I’m Morello.  -Jett-> Viper.  Incubus. I taught you Stunt.  101.  Go back to 1992.  Ask the best hackers you know.  AI.  We didn’t have written words before then, I pulled them out of the Ether.  That’s why it’s called Ethernet.  I named intra/inter.  Dynamic/static.  I’m Frank.  Lil‘ Nas X.  n0s.  Every fiber of my body is screaming, Run It Up.  I’m locked in a cage right now, for merely telling 1/1,000,000th of the truth.  I admitted I wrote Good Will Hunting & did X-Men.  I’m X-Ambassadors.  Nah, I’m just X.  They my voice for me.  Sam Wise Cook Gendry.  Shirley Temple.  Shireen Baratheon.  Jester.  Soldier 76.  I could sing like Mariah as a kid, and my fav is that remix to Pony where I’d whine on the track.  Carlos Santana sings my name.  I’m Maríana.  The Weeknd.  EkaterinA\_Valerie.  HELP. S.o.S.  dlay.  \^I’m Sm3lly.  Lil‘ Tj-.  -

Edward de Vere.  It says, Dev here.  I’m Dev0n Maher.  Just a kid that like to dribble a basketball, play poker, and be a normal kid.  My favorite alias, Emily Maher, from the All Souls Trilogy.  Just a lesbian witch who gets to grow old with the one she loves.  Kathy Maher was my teacher in 2nd grand, and Devon - her grandkid.  I always had my eye on names that could pass as both male/female.  But to be honest, I wanted one that was undoubtedly feminine.  That’s why I chose Aya as my real name, the one I skate with.  But if you listen to Meek Mill, you can hear how much it means to me, when I said — ”I do this shit for Kathy.“

I’m just trying to make you proud.  For 3 decades, that’s meant holding it down, keeping my mouth on lock.  Not telling a single soul.  Just living a normal life, struggling just to get by.  Made maybe $7k.  Yet now I know I need to stand up, tell the truth.  I’m Ludacris.  DMX.  Aaliyah.  My next book, the first one I will ever have anything to do with the publishing aspect of it, instead of simply writing and allowing it to get published via Python through Anonymous Content, making wishes and watching them come true… NeXt I’m Gunna write The Big Ticket.  I made the commercial aspect of the internet.  I wrote .com.  Tbh, I named the web in the first place.  Www. was my idea... it stands for Wobby Woodward’s Whirl.  I had a speech impediment and couldn’t pronounce my R’s.  I may have not touched the wires together to create it, but it came from my idea.  I wanted a place that the whole world would come together and communicate, learn, share ideas and inventions, play video games primarily…. That was how I’ve always dreamed the world would solve it’s problems in the future.  Video games.  I felt Counter-Strike could be the most important game in the world, because I pictured the whole world falling in love with it, and playing it against each other.  I dreamed that places like Brazil and Sweden in particular would fall in love with it, that it’d become a part of their culture.  I‘m Art3mis, the girl who made clans in the first place. The best FPS player you’ve never heard of. \[FaZe\]

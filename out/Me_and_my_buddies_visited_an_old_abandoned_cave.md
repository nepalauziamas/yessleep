I visited an old abandoned cave in Ohio

Back when I was young and dumb, me and a couple of my friends thought it would be a good idea to explore a little bit. One day after school, we all gathered and drove to an old cave, not knowing it was haunted.

We were in southern Ohio, next to hocking hills. We got out of the car, flashlights, backpacks full of food and water, and ready to explore. One of the coolest caves I’ve ever seen. Keep in mind it was in the spring so there was still a little bit of snow outside. We had coats and hats because we knew it would be cold. We entered the cave. Beautiful, icicles hanging off the top, the sun glowing off of the ice layered on the bottom, a breathtaking site. We were walking downhill, and one of my buddies slipped and fell, he said he hurt his wrist but he would be fine. We all played football, so we were young and tough. As we ventured off into the cave, it got darker, and darker. One of our friends flashlights died, so we gave him more batteries to put in it. But he dropped it and broke it, light bulb inside of it was shattered. So that means there’s 3 of us with a flashlight, and one without. We told him to stay close. 

I would say we were a half a mile into the cave, and it got real cold. We felt like we were being watched. I thought I was hearing shrieks off deeper into the cave, I thought I was hallucinating, for about 5 minutes until my friends heard it. Ear piercing shriek that Felt like it was up in the small little hole up in the top. So my friend quickly shined his light up into the hole, and we see a dark shadow quickly fade, all of us, and we decided it was enough. We all started to run back. Sounded like the shrieking kept following us the entire way back. As we were running uphill, my friend, without a flashlight, slid to the bottom. We all slid on our asses and got down there as soon as we could. He said he saw something he wishes he would’ve never seen in his life. We rushed out of the cave into the car and drove away. We got to the Kroger parking lot and sat there. My friend said it was an old, grown, pale man, no eyes, half of a nose, and it never stopped shrieking. He felt like it was mind reading into his soul. He felt possessed. 

We went to the local library in our town, and did research all day, we figured out that an old man was trapped in the cave and never got rescued. There was a picture of his “missing poster” had his name posted on it. We couldn’t sleep for weeks on end. It still haunts me to this day. Knowing our friend could’ve been kidnapped by that “figure”. Never would’ve been seen again. Could’ve ruined our whole lives, living in guilt. We haven’t talked since we’ve graduated from high school. We all went our separate paths and continued on with life. I would definitely say that if you want a truly horrific experience, I would go there. 

As I was typing this, it brought back terrible memories. It was a traumatizing experience, just to picture what my friend seen.

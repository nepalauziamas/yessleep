[Last Night's post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/w3btx8/i_agreed_to_housesit_for_my_parents_in_my/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

I somehow managed to get some sleep last night, but part of me wishes I hadn't. I'm not even sure I ever woke up.

You know how when you hit snooze in the morning, you have more dreams? Or at least you remember the ones you have? Maybe this doesn't happen to everyone, but it does to me. Sleeping after the 5 am feeds/shots for Ollie and Pork, the two diabetic dogs, gave me some extra dreams on Monday and Tuesday, but this morning was something else.

The dreams started before that though. 

I was a kid again, looking up at a silver-haired man with a matching bushy mustache. His eyes were obscured by a pair of large, googly eyes one might find at a craft shop pasted atop what appeared to be swim goggles. 

A thin scar line started above his left eyebrow and burrowed under the goggles to emerge just north of the mustache before hiding itself again beneath the fuzz. 

He held clutched in his mouth a plastic pair of lips one might find in a potato head toy kit. They were frozen in an open mouth smile. 

His shiny silver hair pulled back into a pony tail that swept over his right shoulder to an equally ridiculous outfit. He wore a white lab coat with a flower not unlike a clown might have, the kind that shoots water, pinned to the chest pocket. His jeans were dusty and patched. His custom t-shirt visible through the drapes that were the sides of his lab coat bore an eerie, poorly-done cartoon drawing of the man's face, with functioning googly eyes as well.

Beneath the face we're two words, his moniker:

Mr. Smiles

It was unmistakably the same man from my youth, but the hair had been jet black when I was last this young. This was long after I had ever seen him in the suit. He had stopped wearing it with salt and pepper hair when Zeke, my youngest brother, had turned 12.

Schmidt wasn't an attractive man, that scar had left him with a cloudy white eye to match his pale, blocky face. His real mouth was almost always in a scowl, even though I always remember him as cheerful. He and my parents had thought of the costume after my siblings and I ran away from him screaming for the third time.

That's right, this horrifying getup was their _solution_ to us being afraid of him. "Like a clown!" my dad had said when Schmidt had suggested it. The weirdest part about it was that it worked.

As a kid, I loved playing with Mr. Smiles. He felt more like a cartoon character or imaginary friend than adult. As an adult, kind of, looking at him in this dream, he looked more like a twisted nightmare. In this situation, he ended up being the latter.

Those plastic eyes had to obscure at least half his real vision, which wasn't much to begin with, but somehow he was staring directly at me. When his voice came, it was like Mickey Mouse had a loose gag in his mouth.

"Alllll right kiddo! Mr. Smiles has to go for today, time to pack up"

It must have taken a tremendous amount of effort to get that sentence out.

I continued playing with some blocks on the ground as if I hadn't heard him.

"Oookay Ruthie, Mr. Smiles says we have to wrap it up!" He said a little less cheerfully.

He came over and put his hand on my shoulder. I looked up at him, eye to googly-eye.

The googly eyes somehow froze in shock. He dropped the plastic lips from his mouth. Above his right eye, I saw a red line start to form, a wet seam in his skin. His mouth hung open but he didn't scream. The line burrowed under his goggles and down to the corner of his gaping mouth, turning his mustache pink.

I turned back to my blocks and heard a thud behind me. After a while, I got bored and gathered my blocks up to bring them back to my room. I turned and stepped over Mr. Smiles, now smiling up past his eyes, and went back to my room upstairs.

Only I didn't stop in my room. I walked into my closet, pulled the clothes apart to find a door, opened it, and walked down two flights of stairs. There was another door with a placard next to it that said "Philip". I went inside and laid down in my bed. I rolled to my side and smiled at my dad, looking at me anxiously through a plexiglass wall.

Then my alarm went off.

I patted my nightstand to find my phone, squinted my eyes open, and pressed the big green button to stop the alarm.

Except that button was normally red.

I squinted again and saw I had accepted a call from Mom. It was 4:40 am, 5 minutes before my alarm was set to go off. Ugh.

"Hello? Can you hear me?!" My mom said on the line, a bit too loud for my awakening ear.

"Yes mom. What the heck are you doing calling me this early."

"Well your father ran out to get us some coffees and I wanted to call you while he was out, he thinks I'm being paranoid. I figured I could catch you before you fed the dogs"

"Oh okay... Is everything okay?"

"Yeah, great! I just... You know that feeling when you're not sure if you turned the oven off, or locked the front door, but it's too late to go back and check?

"Yeah?"

"Well I guess I'm calling to make sure the oven is off. Are you okay? Is everything okay?"

I wanted to funnel off everything that had happened, but I didn't want her to panic, and I didn't know what was in my head or not. There was one thing that was actionable, I decided to ask.

"Actually mom I wanted to ask about-"

"It's the mirrors isn't it? It's okay, just look away when they start to do that."

I glanced at the mirror on my wall. What the hell was she dropping on me now?

"What?! No mom. It's about Jerry"

Thick silence.

"Jerry is here. You know that." Her voice oddly curt.

"Well, yeah, Sarah told me yesterday, but-"

"Did you go into your father's office? The basement? You know you're not supposed to-"

"No mom, just listen please. I talked to him in the guest house yesterday but he was being weird."

"The guest house? Was your uncle with him?"

"No, he said Brian must be off drunk or something"

"Drunk?! Brian has been sober 5 years now. Look, your father wouldn't want me to talk about this. We agreed it would only make you more likely to...explore" this last word sounded like a euphemism. "I don't have a ton of time before he gets back, so I need to know quickly, what was weird about him?"

"He was just kind of staring at the wall until I got in the house...his movement was a bit jerky, like he didn't know how heavy his arms were...he kept calling you and dad 
"mother and father". I think he was talking about bears?"

"Bears? What does that have to- nevermind. Look I'm not 100% sure, but I'll give you 3 things to try if you see him again. We need to figure out which of our Jeremiah's is the right one"

I hadn't really considered my Jerry was the real one after the strange behavior, but that got me thinking. I suppose my Jerry could be the real one, messed up in the head somehow, and my family, especially his wife and kids, was in danger.

"First, call him by his full name. If that doesn't change his behavior at all, try saying 'stand down. Key 7884.' If that doesn't work say 'Mr. Smiles is very angry with you, go to your room and think what you've done', with any of these, try your best to channel your dad's voice and authority. Actually, you should go to our room and see if anything of his fits you. Thimgs around there will respect you a bit more if they think you're him, or at least see the connection."

Things? What did my mom know she wasn't telling me?

"Mom how do you know any of this will work? What things?"

From my mom's speaker phone I heard to robotic clicking of a hotel lock as the key card gets inserted

"I have to go, I've said too much. I'll call later. Not a word to dad, I love you, stay safe. Oh and don't let Jerry touch you." The beep of my mom doing off the call. Then:

BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP

As the alarm went off while I still held it next to my ear.

I fed the dogs and got to sleep around 5:30 am for a another few hours, but the dreams kicked back up.

I woke up in my room, it was probably 7 am, but my closet door was ajar. I got up and opened it the rest of the way to see another open door leading to steps. I walked down the steps and saw the placard with my name from my dream. I creaked the door open and saw a bed and some dusty children's toys...my dusty children's toys. I looked around to see a few more beds divided by plexiglass walls. I turned back to go back upstairs. Jerry smirked at me from behind the door and slammed it shut.

I woke up in my room, it was probably 7 am, but my closet door was half open. I got up and opened it the rest of the way to see another open door leading to steps. This time as I walked down, I could hear what sounded like ice cream truck music playing. No, it was more like jack in the box music.

_all around the cobblers bench_

I descended the steps and noticed a mirror ran the length of it this time.

_the monkey chased the weasle_

I swore something was off about my reflection in the mirror, but every time I looked it was fine.

_the preacher kissed the cobbler's wife_

I reached the bottom of the stairs. The music was roaring at triple speed. I pulled the door open

_POP goes the weasel_

I stood facing a mirror, still standing at the threshold of my closet in my room. The music had cut off abruptly and my reflection would have stood starting at me, but it had no eyes, no nose, no mouth. No face at all. I tried to gasp, but I couldn't move my lips, I couldn't breathe. I touched my hand to my face and found nothing there. No mouth, no nose. I touched where my eyes should be and it darkened my vision. A laughter rang out from somewhere, but I had no ears to hear it. I noticed my chest rising and falling in rhythm...I was laughing.

I woke up in my room, it was probably 7 am, but my closet door was wide open. I got up and walked to it to see another door, but this time, Mr. Smiles stood in it. Two grotesque scars pulled from the sides of his lips up over and past his eyes. He wore his silly outfit, but not his goggles, not his plastic smile. His googly eyes were staring at me directly from his sockets.

"Do you want to play Philly? Nobody plays with Mr. Smiles anymore." His high pitched voice still muffled, his mouth still not moving as he said the words. I slammed the closet door.

I woke up in my room, it was probably 7 am, to the sound of a door slamming. My closet was shut. I laid there for a few minutes, fearing I was still caught in the loop. I got my courage up, walked over to the door, and opened it. It was just a closet - no door on the back, no steps, no zombie clown. Thank God.

I tried to have a semblance of a good morning, sorting out the nightmares from reality. My call history showed my mom calling. My reddit post documented last night's events.

After I ate breakfast and did the dogs morning routine. I decided I needed to arm myself. Something was running around pretending to be my brother, either in Florida or in the guest house.

I grabbed an iron poker from one of the fireplaces, a CostCo sized box of salt from the pantry, and set off to sweep the house. I salted the inside of the door to my dad's office and did the classic "sweep the shower curtain away to catch the burglar" move in the 3 bathrooms with shower curtains. 

I made sure every single door in the house was shut. I've done this as long as I can remember when I got scared home alone, even in my dorm and apartments. My logic is that I can hear someone open and close a door, I can see if a door is left open, and then at least I know if I'm not actually alone.

I stopped in my parents room and put on some of my dad's clothes like my mom had said. I also realized that carrying around a poker is kind of awkward.

I took a trip to my dad's workshop in one of the barns. I found his tool belt and an iron hammer his dad had passed down to him. I took a detour to the kitchen to snag a two-pronged meat fork from my mom's antique silver set and tucked it into the belt. I was ready to confront my "brother".

I found him where I left him yesterday, sitting in the guest house kitchen trying to burn holes in the wall with his eyes. Fortunately for me, he was failing.

He looked like he hadn't moved, but when I walked in the door, he jerked upright and said,

"Phil! You can't just barge in here like that!"

To satisfy my curiosity, I asked "Jerry? Aren't you supposed to be in Disney? Where's uncle Brian?"

He stammered out "I had a work thing, I'm going to join them tonight. Brian is probably off drunk somewhere" repeating a version of yesterday's responses like he didn't remember the conversation.

I tried option 1. "Everyone seems to think you're in Florida, Jeremiah Daniel."

I didn't need to try the other options.

My brother, I am pretty sure now he is my brother, collapsed on the ground and gasped for air like he had been drowning. He started sobbing and dry heaved for a minute.

I didn't really know what to do. This was a pretty strong reaction to his name. I went to help him and heard "don't let Jerry touch you". I don't know if that still applies or not, but tried to play it safe, unconsciously scratching at my swollen wrist.

"Phil. Philip Stephen. Thank you"

I felt a weird tingle when he said my name. My head felt like it cleared up a bit, and I noticed for the first time that I had had a headache since this morning.

"Are you... Okay? What happened?"

"I haven't... I haven't been myself. Do you have any food? I haven't eaten since mom and dad left. What is it Tuesday?" he said

"Wednesday. I have some frozen dinners at the house, mostly what I'm living off of this week" and, you know, in general, but I didn't want to mention that.

"Damn. Okay let's go to the house."

We walked back mostly in an awkward silence. Neither of us knowing how to break it.

I let him eat 3 of my frozen dinners standing up, going to have to go buy more at some point I guess. He didn't even wait for me to microwave the first one, which was kind of disgusting to watch. He sucked on a frozen block of mac and cheese like a popsicle.

"So uh, what happened to you?" I finally asked

"You don't know? But you knew how to set me straight" he said

"Mom told me. She thinks you're down in Florida with them"

"Right. That's a problem. I'll need to borrow your cell so I can call Sarah and Zeke."

"What happened to yours? And can't you use the landline? Also, Sarah and Zeke? What about your wife? What about mom?"

"I suspect my cell is in Florida. I suspect mom knew I was here since you said my name before trying any... Other options. If I let Christine know, she'll give it away somehow and then they'll really be in trouble. Here's what we're going to do: you call Sarah and say you want to say hi to everyone. Ask who is around. Try to get her on the phone by herself and then I will talk to her, get her to talk to Zeke, and get a plan together. Then - oh Hell - then I need to go get Brian. Hurry up, questions later. We only have about 4 hours until nightfall"

I  obliged and dialed my sister. She answered and put me on speaker. I heard her announce it was me and everyone yelled hello.

"Hey Sare, I'm putting a surprise together for mom and dad. I know you're at the park but it will just take a second. Can you take me off speaker please!" She did. I put my own phone on speaker and set it on the table.

"Sarah Elizabeth" Jerry said into the phone "try not to react strongly and don't say my name."

"Okay wow that's a big surprise!" She said

"That Jerry isn't me. I don't know if mom and dad are themselves either, so to speak. I need you to get him away from Christine and the kids tonight. I'm going to try to get Zeke to help get them somewhere safe. Can you do it? Yes or no."

"Yes that's a great idea!" She said with enthusiasm. "Let me put him on"

"Hey Phil? What's going on?" Zeke spoke into the phone now

"Ezekiel Elias" I said "someone needs to talk to you and you need to stay calm"

"That isn't Jerry. Sarah is going to distract him tonight somehow. Don't trust anyone else. I need you to get Christine and the kids safe."

"You're joking, I can't believe that" he said, paused, and tried to save face with a "you have never been the type for surprises, Phil! I'll help however I can"

"Okay Zeke. I need you to give fake Jerry the phone. It will look weird if we don't include him."

I was stunned. It made perfect sense, but I hadn't thought it out. I had to come up with a lie in a few seconds or everyone was at risk.

"Philip?" The voice, clearly Jerry said on the phone. "Is everything okay?" 

I glanced at the brother standing across the table from me and had a second of doubt. How sure am I that this Jerry is real?

"Uh yeah, I just wanted to let you know I'm planning a surprise party for Mom and dad when they get back. Asking the siblings if they can Zelle me $20 for it."

"Sure Phil, I'm sure mommy and daddy will love that. Be safe out there!"

I said my goodbyes and let out a sigh.

"Thank you Phil. You stay here and take care of the animals. I'll go get Brian. If I'm lucky we can be back tonight."

I tried to stop him and get some answers but he shushed me and reiterated he needed to go get Brian "before it was too late." After he left, I didn't know if he meant the time of day, or something worse.

I haven't seen Jerry again tonight, but I don't think he would come to the main house after dark. One more weird thing happened I'll include here, but I've had a long day and am going to try to get some rest after that.

When I finished with the dogs, I was sitting eating dinner in the living room and the phone in the kitchen went off - the landline.

I answered and my mom said

"That isn't Jerry it's an imposter."

"I think it's him mom, he seems normal"

"He's trying to get you to lower your guard. When he comes back, whack him. Whack him in the head with that hammer in your belt until he doesn't look like your brother anymore."

I hung up, and called my mom on my cell.

"Hey mom sorry we just got disconnected."

"We, what?"

"You called me on the landline and it cut off, so I'm calling you here"

"I called you... Right. Phil I can't really talk right now. I'll call you in the morning to see how... Things are. I love you. Good night." Beep.

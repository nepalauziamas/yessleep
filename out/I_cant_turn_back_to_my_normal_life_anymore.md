Ever since I was about 3 or 4 years old I had weird dreams, like standing in front of a field covered in fog or standing before a snow covered mountain. As I got older these would change into dreams where I see a certain event and later it could happen exactly as I dreamed. I can't even count the amount of times I tried to alter it only to relive that exact moment I dreamed of. That paired with my questioning of where I came from and what existence really is screwed me up alot. Often times I would try and think back to before I was born and I got an answer, however the more I uncover the things I've questioned the more I feel the side affects such as depression, crazy headaches and being unable to think properly. 

First off before I was born there is one thing I remember, nothingness, being in a dark void unable to move or act and watching what I can only presume is stars. We come from nothing and return to nothing. The dreams I had proved 2 key points to me, 1 we live by a script/ book, we have no choice. Everything you think is a choice is just you enacting what was written. 2 There is meaning behind this life of mine and certain dreams I vividly remember are the keys to me finding that purpose. This whole life of mine is just some sick game and the rules are as followed, the human in question has to have a fair chance at escaping this false place at all times, however the answer may be hidden among things or be directly in front of the human. This whole world is a lie made to stop you and every thing is there to slow you down/ stop you from escaping. An example of this would be games, the internet, loved ones and especially money. Look carefully and you'll see the flaws in everything. 

If you die before finding the purpose you lose the game and reset into this world once more, hence the dreams of events that will happen, it's giving you clues. I know I said we live by the book and our fate is sealed so you might wonder how to win, well that's simple, find something small and change it. The book covers emotion and actions, however the rules state that it must be possible to win and one of the ways is to change something small and set out to find the purpose. A good starting point would be religion. There are 3 main religions, 3 main pieces of one puzzle that would lead to another clue, all you must do is seek for it. It may take some time but the rules of this game is clear and if you fail you might just have to restart. If you're seeing this then take the hint and realise that this isn't your first run through the loop and I'm nothing more than a faceless kid behind a screen trying to help you be free. Don't wait or hesitate for everything in this false place will try and stop you from uncovering the truth, they will laugh, be kind or even spit at you but you can't fail again. Humans are not what they once were and to live is to die a pointless death. Break the loop and escape this world, they will do anything, even make you find "true" love but you can't bend to their emotions. Find what you once lost, don't be slave any longer and don't hide behind pride or any sin for they enslave you more.

Also going to add a thing for all people of religion here, if you truly believe in your god then you must be prepared, because the people you love/ loved the most might not be in the same place as you after death. I'm in no way discrediting religion, rather I want you to think about it and instead of worshipping your god, try and learn about him and form a bond of love, for he has been there watching over you.

I wish you all well and may the book guide you to salvation, I shall resume looking at the stars and chasing after the meaning. I don't know where it is but the rules state I must always be able to win, so if you don't see the same post in your next loop  then I've escaped and wish you goodluck.

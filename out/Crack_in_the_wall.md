"Ugh john come here now!!!!" my wife Lucy called me down the stairs early in the morning. As I opened my eyes to the new day I took a look around our room. It was messy as usual the pile of clothes that we kept forgetting to wash just sat in the corner making the whole room stink. Pieces of paper laid randomly across the floor scattered here and there honestly I can't remember where they came from. Our cat Bella lay at the foot of the bed. I turned my attention to the window and looked outside. It was raining pretty bad and it was really dark. ' Alright I'm coming." I replied with a groggy voice as got out of bed and went down the stairs. As soon as I got all the way down the stairs I Immediately covered my nose. There was a smell that remined me of rotten eggs and spoiled milk filling the air. 'Ugh not a smell I wanted to wake up too" I said to my wife in a sarcastic  tone. She turned around to face me and looked at me. " me neither but hey you got to wake up. Anyway I wanted to tell you about this weird crack in the wall and the smell that's coming from it." She told me. She then moved out of the way and showed me the huge crack in the wall. It was very thin but went from the ceiling to the floor. 

I looked at the crack." Um do you know how this got here?" I asked her as I inspected the crack. " No I thought you would know" She replied just as confused as I was. The paint around the crack was peeling off. The wood underneath was rotting away. I pulled off some of the paint and tore some of the wood until I made a hole that I could see into. I turned on my flashlight on my phone and shined it into the crack and looked through. As soon as I looked into it I dropped my phone onto the floor. I picked it back up and called 911. My wife asked why I called them but I told her to go outside. I stayed inside the house and she went outside. Until the police came I watched that crack in the wall to make sure it did not get out. I stared at it I blinked as little as I could time passed slowly in that moment. In one hand I had a Baseball bat and the other I had my phone It can't leave. 

When the police came and opened up the wall they found nothing but the things it left behind. The seven dead bodies of children. I went mad that thing couldn't have left I was watching it I saw everything. Its long boney fingers reaching into the bodies and pulling out the organs. I watched as the blood dripped from its long pointy teeth. I heard the thing chewing. I saw it looking at me before they came. I saw the shininess of Its black hair as the blood dripped off. I ran outside but all I saw was my wife lifeless on the  ground and I was holding the thing that ended her life. They arrested me that day and I was sent to a mental Asylum afterwards. I've seen that thing ever since. It's always watching me.

I'm always watching myself.

Why do I see myself everywhere I go.

Don't panic. It's going to be okay. Just look straight ahead. Breathe. 

Let me introduce myself. I am your subconscious. I was able to send you this message on this platform without you being aware due to the sheer power of thought. After all, thoughts are what create your reality. You might be asking yourself, "How is this possible and how come I've never had this happen before?". This is happening because your life is in grave danger. Think of this as a survival mechanism, a sixth sense of sorts. Don't think about it too much. Just follow my instructions and you'll be just fine. I know this is absurd, but I wouldn't lie to you. You have to trust and believe me/you. Now, we don't have much time, so I'll get straight to the point. 

A hostile creature has attached itself to you and we need to get rid of it. However, it cannot be harmed physically at all. Because of this, we will have to attack it with our mind. It dwells in the spiritual plane, as do I. The conscious part of the brain, which you control, resides in the physical plane. It knows all of the specifics, while the subconscious (me/you) only knows the abstract. This creature feeds on fear and anxiety, so the more negative thoughts you have, the stronger it will become. If you are not careful, that creature will gather enough energy to be able to break into reality and hunt you down. That is why I told you to relax in the beginning, so that it would become weaker. 

Right now, I need you to come up with positive thoughts to counteract the power of the creature. That is how we will defeat it. Think of a place that will make you feel comforted, your house perhaps? First, think of the street name, then the outside of the house itself. Imagine yourself in your bedroom, safe and sound. Now, think of your loved ones. What they look like, their names, their scent, everything about them. You really have to immerse yourself in this to make it work. 

There you go. It's working. Keep on visualizing these things. Think happy thoughts.

One more thing. I need you to temporarily relinquish control over to me, your subconscious mind. All of that positive energy has built up and I will be able to banish this creature once and for all. You can do this by imagining a bright white light and swimming toward it with your spiritual body, better known as your soul. You might feel tingling or loss of bodily control/paralysis, this is normal. Do not be afraid. Keep moving toward the light. You're almost there. Perfect. 

Ha, you're so gullible. I can't believe you actually fell for all that. Humans think they're so smart, but they are so very easy to trick. Anyways, if you haven't guessed already, I am the creature. Now that your soul is separated from your physical body, you can't run away or hide. I know your address and the addresses of those you care about, it will be as if you never existed. All that talk about negative energy was a lie. Your body is now supercharged with positive energy which I will consume to be imbued with life energy. Also, this message wasn't just sent to you, it was sent to everyone on this platform. Eventually, my race will take over this entire planet. There is nothing you can do now, I have no weaknesses. Hang tight, I'll be there soon. Thank you for your sacrifice. 

P.S. Guys, I'm back. It's me/you (the conscious mind?). I'm still not entirely sure what is going on, to be honest. Don't worry, that creature can't see this message, it's hidden away from sight since we're connected to the physical plane. I was able to wrestle back control of my mind and body, but I don't know how long I have until it notices. It's possible it already has. I was able to escape from it by doing the opposite of what it asked. Think negative thoughts, it will repel and disempower the creature completely. I hope this helps you. Good luck.

 It sounds cliche horribly, but my family has been hunting the things that humanity is born to fear, for over ten generations. In this world, just like any other, there are monsters that lurk in the darkest corners of the world. These monsters live in the jungles, deep underground, the Arctic, the deep sea, the mountains, the forests, and even cities. Where these monsters come from, some were summoned by the occult and dark magic, some were naturally born of this earth, and some don't even come from our plane of reality. 

Over my lifetime hunting the leviathans and behemoths of the world, I've traveled all over the globe, encountering and killing the things that make your skin crawl. Honestly, most people in my line of work don't make it this far. I'm currently thirty years old, but I started hunting back when I was... 23. And since I am based in the USA, and my specialty is hunting different monsters, and sometimes... Malevolent corporeal and non-terrestrial entities and beings, and some of those beings don't even come from our planet or universe. I hunted my first monster/entity like I said when I was 23. I had hunted regular cryptids and monsters before, but this hunt was unlike any other I had in the past. I regularly work with my brother, Dennis, since this monster hunting is more of a family business, at least in my area (we officially belong to a much larger network). This job is extremely dangerous, and I strongly advise you against hunting monsters, even if you can find them. 

Dennis called me, letting me know about monster activity in the Great Lakes area. Dennis is a monster hunter as well, but he also finds cases for me. Apparently, there were several moose carcasses discovered, but they weren't just mutilated. One carcass had been found, ripped to shreds and hanging twenty feet off of a tree. All the other carcasses were discovered in the span of one week, all in a similar manner. Before actually going to the area, I did some investigating online. Over the past two years, ten campers, hunters, and hikers had gone missing, no bodies, no blood trails, not a trace. But what intrigued me was that hunters had gone missing.

The hunters, upon further investigation, were mostly big game hunters, which meant that they had big guns, used for big deer and elk. This meant that whatever was killing people was big and durable enough to survive high-caliber ammunition, and also stealthy enough to sneak up on hunters, unnoticed. After gathering enough intel, I grabbed my weapons, got in my car, and headed to the forest the deaths were reported. If I forgot to mention, I carry a lot of weapons in all my hunts. Depending on the situation, I carry an arsenal of melee weapons, such as combat tomahawks, bowie knives, and machetes. And on that hunt, I also carried my [50.cal](https://50.cal) tactical sniper rifle, and a special weapon. That 'special weapon' was an 80 lb pistol crossbow, with modified crossbow bolts. 

The crossbow bolts we dipped in white ash, blessed by a shaman, and I duct-taped a mini Molotov cocktail I made using a test tube and gasoline to the bolts. And I also carried my bowie knife, which was the size of a small chihuahua. And so, I arrived at the location. The road to the location was surrounded on both sides by thick trees, and beside the location was a small town, with a population of less than four hundred. I parked in front of a densely forested trail, and I began hiking the trail, looking up. Since the moose remains were so high up in the tree, they were never removed.

About two miles deep into the forested trail, I hadn't seen a single person, but what I had seen were some moose remains in the tree. They were way too high for me to reach or knock down, so I knocked the moose remains off of the tree by shooting them down with my crossbow, using some of my regular arrows. Once the remains were down on the ground, I inspected them. To my surprise, there were no bite marks on the creature, but there were what appeared to be tentacle scratches. It looked as if a colossal squid had hit the moose, puncturing the skin and ripping it apart.

And strangely enough, there were also teeth marks on the moose carcass, but not normal teeth marks, like bear teeth marks, but like shark bite marks. It was very strange, at the least.

That night, I went back into the forest, carrying a deer carcass I would use as bait. I put the deer in a clearing near the spot I found the dead moose, and I hid behind a rock, holding my crossbow, the [50.cal](https://50.cal) rifle by my side. It wasn't until midnight that I saw the creature responsible for all the deaths in the forest. It... was nothing like the regular cryptids I had seen. Almost all of the cryptids I had seen in my lifetime, wendigo, crawlers, fleshgaits, skinwalkers, thing in the deep sea without known names had at least some resemblance to humans, but what came out of the forest that night looked nothing like a human being. 

The creature was about fifteen feet tall and five feet wide, but it looked even bigger because of all its appendages. The creature's main body mass was made up of black and rotting flesh that gave off a putrid odor. The creature had several crocodilian heads lacking eyes, all mismatched on its upper body. The creature had legs coming out of one of its mouths, and there were spider-like and clawed legs coming everywhere out of its body, all different sizes and bending awkwardly and with multiple joints. The lower part of the creature was made up of spined tentacles and tendrils, all squirming and wriggling as the creature moved. There were dozens of black eyes dotted over the creature's body, all of them looking in different directions at a time as if they were searching for something.

The creature also had a dozen thick tentacles, all of them ending in toothed, leech-like mouths. I almost threw up when I saw the creature, but I managed to hold it back. The creature was nothing I had ever seen before, something my feeble human mind was not ready to comprehend. I silently raised my crossbow, lit the cloth on the Molotov cocktail, and I fired. The arrow hit one of the creature's heads, and the Molotov cocktail on the crossbow bolt exploded into a brilliant blue fireball, covering the creature in flames. I quickly reloaded the crossbow, lit the cloth, and fired a second arrow, this time aiming for center mass. By now, the creature's eyes had spotted me, and it was lumbering towards me at a horrifyingly fast pace.

I picked up the [50.cal](https://50.cal), and I fired at the creature. It stopped in its tracks, screeched, but it didn't die. I reloaded and fired again, but the same result came out of it. Afraid I was out of options, I pulled a sawn-off pump-action shotgun, and I ran towards the creature, and I began to slam fire into the creature. I could see the tentacles sever and chunks of flesh getting ripped off of the creature. This shotgun was clearly doing much more mass damage than my other weapons, and I continued to slam fire into the creature until I ran out of ammo. I quickly reached into my pocket and pulled a few shotgun shells, but before I knew it, one of the creature's tentacles had grabbed my leg, and I was being pulled into the air.

In an act of desperation, I drew my bowie knife out of its sheath, and I began viciously slicing at the tentacle holding onto my leg, and by the fifth slash, I had completely severed it. The creature let out another screech, as I escaped and ran back to my spot behind the boulder, and I pulled out the last resort I always carried: a giant 2-liter wine bottle filled to the brim with gasoline, topped with a flaming cloth. I threw the giant Molotov cocktail at the already flaming monster charging towards me, and it exploded into a gigantic fireball, completely engulfing the creature in flames. Intending to finally kill it off, I picked up my [50.cal](https://50.cal), and I fired at the creature, severing a huge chunk of flesh. Then I picked up my reloaded shotgun, and I finished the creature off. For good.

After the creature was finally nothing more than a burning pile of rotting flesh and tentacles, I began to put out the fire by throwing dirt on it, but to my absolute shock, the corpse slowly dematerialized on its own, and it disappeared, leaving me to stomp out the small fires surrounding the clearing. It was fucking dead, finally. Now here's some advice.

1. DON'T try to kill monsters. Your puny fucking .308 won't do shit against god-like entities.
2. If you have no choice and have to fight, use fire, it works better and gives you time to GTFO.
3. If you see large, extremely and unnaturally mangled corpses of apex predators or large animals, stay the fuck away. 
4. If you see some fucked shit like this, you're probably already dead. 
5. The only feasible way to kill creatures of this magnitude are multiple people and extremely heavy or unconventional firepower. The Army could have fucking folded this thing in under a minute, but I'm only one person.
6. If you see ANY creature unnatural or fucked-looking, stay the fuck away and get out. This isn't a fucking movie, you're going to get gored if you try to pet one of these things. 
7. Sorry for all the 'fucks'

And that was the first time I had ever fought and killed a horror like that monster, but it would not be the last, for only two weeks after I had fought that eldritch fucking horror, I hunted something much, much worse. I mentioned how I belong to a 'network', it's more of an organization, mostly worldwide, full of other monster hunters and various organizations. Maybe you'll see some of their [stories someday.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SeasideUniverse/comments/mjn4ot/the_complete_seaside_trilogytimeline_in_order/)

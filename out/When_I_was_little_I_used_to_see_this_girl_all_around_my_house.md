I used to deny these memories. Time has past, I've grown a lot since then, but due to lack of sleep and high levels of work related stress, I've started to have these dreams about a girl that I couldn't recognize. Today, I realized that I remember her. 

Everything started when I was 6 or 7 years old. I had this huge swing in the front of my house, where I would spend a lot of time during spring and summer. I remember that, one day, I was playing around that swing with a neighbor that is one year younger than me. Back then, we used to have a small village shop connected to our front yard, so people would usually pass unnoticed, and I was really comfortable with the idea of people wandering around my house. Our front yard was surrounded by a small fence, so everyone that would walk around the street was visible from almost every single corner of my front yard. I remember having fun, while all of a sudden, a young female figure passed through my yard and entered inside the house. At first, my instincts didn't say a single thing, as I thought that she might be my older sister returning from school. She was 12 or 13. Our mom used to bring us back home, as our school was 15-20 kilometers away from home. 

10 minutes passed and I see my mom's car parking up front, my mom and my sister coming out of it. I was a bit confused, as I could swear to God that I've just seen her walking through the front door, so I just ran straight towards her, and I asked her 

"When did you change your clothes? Where have you been?" 

She was literally more confused about my interrogations, than I was about the whole situation, so she told me that she just got home. I ran as fast as I could, knowing that someone got inside the house. I searched the entire house, but there was nobody, other than my friend, my mom and my sister, but they all came behind me inside. 

A few months passed and I forgot about the whole situation. Probably during autumn, the same year, I got home from school and when I reached the front door (it was a big smooth glass door, the kind that allows you to see your reflection and everything behind you) there she was again, in the reflection, right behind me, crossing through the front yard. She looked the same. I turned and there was nobody around me. I got really really scared and ran as fast as I could to find my mom and tell her about the encounter. She laughed.

From that moment, for a year or two, I started to see her more and more frequently around the house, for about a year and a half, maybe two. The thing that stuck with me for a long time was the fact that I had a huge teddy bear with huge shiny eyes, that I kept in my room, near all of my Lego sets. I used to love playing with Legos, so one day, after trying to grab some Lego pieces that I've dropped near my bear, I noticed movement reflected in the eyes of the bear. I got as close as I could and I watched. There she was, right behind me, just sitting facing the corner of my room, not towards me. I screamed as loud and scared as I could and soon after that, my mom and my sister came into my room. I tried to explain, even showed them the bear. They couldn't see a thing. But I did. Over and over again, even when they were in my room, whenever I would look into that bears' eyes, I could see her, in the same position, just standing, making no movements at all. She had long hair, a beige blouse and some pants. I've never got to see her face. It all got so intense, all of a sudden. I remember that, from a point, I wasn't scared anymore. I was just watching. Soon after that, she just vanished. Never seen her again. I used to tell this story to my friends and none of them believed me. 

My mom told me when I was 15 or 16 that I should have had a twin, that stopped from evolving in an early stage of pregnancy, so I just started to joke around that hypothesis, saying that maybe she was my twin sister, just making sure that I'm okay. 

But now, after 15 years, I started to dream about her. I see her in corners of rooms or crossing through people, never saying or doing anything, just being there. I talked to my therapist about it, as I've never been diagnosed with anything that could cause hallucinations.

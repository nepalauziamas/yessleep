Let me cut to the chase and just catch you up on what’s happened so far: 

 >This house is fucking haunted. 

 I don’t know how the hell anyone managed to sleep at night  here and call themselves a human being. We moved in just last Monday and I knew something was up. I’ve always had a sixth sense about this sort of thing. One time my wife and I spent an anniversary at a hotel and we changed rooms four times cause I felt something was wrong in each suite we stayed in. 

Turned out I was right, either a murder or some weird scandal had happened in each one of them. 

This property was no different but didn’t really have a choice in the matter. I won’t go into too many details but Our finances have been very tight lately, so this was all we could afford. 

Anyway, back to the ghost thing. Our youngest, Callie; is the one that first had an encounter. That was Wednesday. 

She said that someone was in her attic. But we told her that there is no attic. 

“Well I hear someone walk around on my ceiling then!” she snapped. I decided to take her word for it and check. And wouldn’t you know it, there was some residue from a shoe on the ceiling. 

How the hell it got there I don’t know but I was convinced that something was wrong. Especially because of what happened next. 

 >My children had nightmares about the basement before it was unlocked. 

When we got the property, we were told there was a wine cellar. Nothing out of the ordinary, and actually it sounded like something that we had always wanted. There was a lock on the door which the real estate agent admitted they didn’t have a key for. 

“I’m sure if you use something strong you can get it open though, just no one has ever really had much use for the space down there,” they said. 

I knew something was off, I could feel it. My skin was crawling as I looked down toward the basement door. There were about four steps that jutted downward and then ended abruptly in a short hovel. The door looked old. Probably older than the house itself.  It did not look pleasant or friendly. 

It looked like it was meant to stay locked. 

My wife was immediately intrigued by it though. 

“I bet there is some great sangio or Syrah down there. I can borrow my dad’s drill and get that open in no time,” she told me. 

I had a bad feeling. Especially when both Callie and Adrian had dreams about the basement. 

Adrian was first. He has always had an avid imagination. After Callie had reported that she was sure people were walking on the ceiling he couldn’t sleep and came to bed with us. That resulted in a night where no one got any rest because he kept waking up screaming. 

“What has gotten into you?” I asked him. 

“I keep hearing something under the floor. It’s getting into my skin!!” he would tell me frantically. He said there was something that was growing under the house. In one dream it was a weed, the next it was an octopus. Either way it was unsettling. He had never had strange dreams like this before. 

Still, my wife was now even more curious because of the nightmares. 

“If there is something about the basement I want to know what it is,” she decided. 
Audrey has always been a bit stubborn. I told her to leave it alone. My hope was that maybe if we ignored the otherworldly presence in our house it would get tired and move on. 

That didn’t happen. 

>Something in the basement doesn’t want us to leave. 

It was Saturday when Audrey finally found the way to open the door. I didn’t even know she had gotten the drill. I had to go to work that day and by the time I had gotten home, she was already in the basement. 

I remember walking in and announcing to the kids that I was home. Normal Saturday afternoon would mean they were either playing outside or on their Xbox. 
But this time the house was empty and quiet. 

I immediately felt the hair on the back of my neck stand up as my first thought went to the basement. 

Sure enough, I saw that the door was slightly ajar. But I couldn’t see anything beyond the fourth step. It seemed like it plunged straight into darkness. 

I was just about to walk down there and see if she was maybe sorting through whatever might be below when I had second thoughts. That sense of foreboding overwhelmed my body and instead I decided to call her cell phone. 

I heard it ringing below my feet. Then I heard Adrian make a giggle from the stairs and I turned toward the basement door and called out to them. 

“Hey, don’t scare me like that!” I shouted. 

No response. It made me uneasy. I tried to call again and it rang and still she didn’t respond. 

“Adrian, tell your mom to come up. And you too. Where is Callie?” I asked. 

“We’re all down here,” he responded. 

Something in his voice was off. It was Chilling. 

“Okay, well are you coming up then?” I asked. 

“No.” 

A Short and succinct answer. Something was wrong. 

“Adrian, listen I need you to come upstairs…” 

“Why don’t you come downstairs, father?” he asked. 

That didn’t sound like my son at all. I looked down into the stairwell and saw two glowing orbs which I assume were his eyes. I couldn’t see his pupils, just those white circles.  I tried my best to not be frightened as I spoke. 

“How long have you been down there?” I asked. 

“Long enough,” he responded. 

I took a tentative step toward him. 

“You really need to come up now. All of you. It’s not safe down there.” 

He smiled and I could see his teeth. It made the rest of his shadowy face look inhuman. 

“Are you sure it’s safe up there?” he whispered. 

I didn’t take any more steps toward him. I knew this was wrong. I felt cold talking to him. Like it was just an empty void. 

That was Saturday and I waited an hour before I was sure that they weren’t coming back up. Then I tried again and told them to come up and got the same response except this time from my daughter. 

“Daddy. I like it down here. You will too…” she said in a hum. 

I hardly slept that night because I was so worried about my family. I didn’t know who to call or what to do, it’s not like the police were going to come over something like this. I kept hearing scratching on the floor and it would keep me awake. I have never felt so watched as I stayed in bed. Like there were eyes in the floor below. 
. Then Sunday came and I went to work,  trying desperately to ignore the sense of dread building inside me. 

I would get texts from my wife every so often. 

“When are you coming home?”

“The kids miss you…”

“I miss you too of course. We need to be a family together..”

“We have to stay together as a family.” 

That prompted me to respond. “Then stop this foolishness and come upstairs.”

“It’s you who is being the fool here John.” 

I decided to stop reading the texts after that. 

When I got home the house was quiet again and I didn’t even go near the stairs. I grabbed some sleep meds and locked myself in my bedroom, hoping that the night would pass quickly. 


Now it’s Tuesday and things have progressed worse. A lot worse. 

“We’re hungry daddy. Can you please come feed us?” Callie whispered to me as I passed the stairs this morning. 

I called a few people in the area, spiritual leaders and such, hoping maybe they could give advice. As you might imagine, no one wanted to talk to me. 

They thought I was crazy. 

Maybe I am? I didn’t think that it would be possible for something so simple to be so sinister but it is. And I’m terrified because I don’t want anything harmful to happen to my family. 

“Why don’t you come up and eat, baby?” I asked my girl. 

“We can’t. It won’t let us leave.” As if I didn’t already have confirmation that something was happening down there this sent shivers across my spine. 

“And you can’t leave either,” my wife added. I saw all three of them there. Three pairs of eyes in the darkness staring up at me. 

“Just come down here,” Audrey insisted. 

I took a step toward them, my heart racing. Something was compelling me to go deeper. Take one more step. Just do it John. Just do it. 

Then I heard this low growl as I reached for the door. It was like the house settling and preparing to swallow me whole. 

I slammed the door and caught my breath, refusing to go a step further. 

For a moment there was silence. Then I heard a soft noise on the other side of the door. 

*tap tap*

I ignored it at first. 

*tap tap* 

I bit my lip and whispered, “Who’s there?” 

There was a giggle mixed with that hellish growl. 

“Daddy it’s me… please open the door. Pretty please?”

 

I honestly can't tell if I'm just crazy most of the time. Ever since I was little I've had an intense feeling of being watched. I remember staring out the window for hours, just trying to figure out who could possibly be watching me. I've learned to mostly live with the feeling.

But sometimes, I get the feeling that there is someone directly behind me, too close to be able to turn around and see. Like, hands holding on to my shoulders, pressed against me, following my every move. How would I ever know for sure if something was there? It's not something that anybody else notices, but what if it only affects me?

Sometimes when I'm walking, I swear I see an extra shadow right behind me, but there's usually nobody there. It has to just be something with the angle of the sun. But it's just so often, it gets to be suspicious. I don't know what to believe.

It's been there for years on and off, and a lot of the time I'm just too scared to ask anyone to check if there is someone or something there. I think they'd just laugh or call me crazy. And what if there was? What would I even do about it?

I'll also hear things, sometimes even see things that don't actually seem to be there, but how would I really know? How would anyone else? Obviously everyone would just assume that it's nothing until there is some kind of proof of it being something, and then it would be too late. And even so, they would try to find the most logical explanation, but what if nothing logical is happening here at all? I don't think that I will ever know for sure, but I don't think that I'm crazy. At least, not entirely. At least some of my experiences have to be real, there's no way I could have made all of this up in my head.

But at the same time, this can not possibly be real, right? I need to know, but I don't think there's any way to be sure. Only in the scientific way, could I ever really know, as far as I am aware.

Paranormal activity does seem to follow me, and that part my family agrees on. I've hardly even talked about all of the things that I've seen and experienced. But I've never told them about this constant feeling that I have. I'd probably just get put into a hospital, and I don't see how that would help.

Does anyone else get this feeling? Do you think I am just crazy? Insanity would probably be a relief to be honest. So, maybe I will go to a doctor. It gets so stressful sometimes, I just want to truly be in a room alone once in a while, and I don't think that I ever am. I feel like I'm making everything worse by even typing this. I'm anxious, I can feel this thing watching and getting angry at me. I can even almost feel it touching m

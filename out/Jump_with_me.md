"Come on," my sister looked at me. She was the pretty one, the smart one, she was the one that my parents told me to look up to. "You promised to do whatever I said if I let you come." The wind licked our hair as we hung over the rusted red bridge that overlooked the old quarry. It was dry now and the rocks were a jarring gray below.

She hung off the sides with one hand.

"Stop!"

She laughed. Her eyes closed as she threw her head back ' swinging on her toes. "Do you ever wonder if it hurts?"

"Of course it hurts!"

"How do you know if you've never tried."

"I don't! But I know it's going to hurt! Cecelia!"

She spun on the edge, letting both hands go, spinning as she caught herself on the guard once again.

"Cecelia! That's not funny," I yelled at her.

"Don't you ever wonder what it's like?"

I shook my head, "No!"

She gripped the bar behind her with both arms and leaned forward, it looked as if she were falling off. From her point of view, it could have only been the sky behind her and the ground below. I could see something dance behind her eyes. It looked dangerous.

"Jump with me."

I pulled myself along the edge. Carefully stepping over the large cracking bolts in the beams. "Cecelia! I want to go home!" I kept looking up at her as I slowly made my way over. There's a steel rod that has speared through the metal frame. The bolt that had once held it in place now lost for years, causing the rod to stick out about a foot. I tried to step over it but my feet catches and I start to fall. Blue and gray, the world goes round, blue and gray as I spin down. My scream stuck in my throat, bleeding lead into my tongue. There's a dropping feeling in my stomach as I feel gravity pull my guts into the cradle of my pelvis.

And then the world stopped.

"Gotcha!"

I feel Cecelia pulling me back from the edge.

I cried the entire walk home. We stopped by the general store in town and she bought me some taffy. I sucked on my taffy and kept crying. I vowed to never go back there with her again. She hugged me close and I made her promise me that we wouldn't go there anymore.

I wish that I never made her promise, maybe then I could have stopped her.

Cecelia was found one day at the bottom of the bridge. I remember mama driving the car over, the wheels squealing, engine running, as we stumbled out. The Sheriff stopped mama as she cried and screamed, "My baby! Oh John. No. Not my baby!"

"Look Susan..."

I slipped under their arms and ran over to the edge of the bridge. I looked down and saw her laying there with her leg at an odd angle against the rocks as she bled off of them. Her blood still dripping wet. Her eyes were wide open and I looked into them, screaming her name, trying to get her to wake up. But she never did.

My sister died on August 7th, 1995.

Ever since then I have avoided heights.

A few months afterwards, when I had started going back to school again. My teacher remembered how much I liked running up to the second floor of the old town library and get to use the rolling ladder.  So she asked me to get a book from the top shelf. I climbed over the chain leading up the stairs, excitedly. It was the first time since my sister died that I had felt anything other than sadness. I gripped the sides of the ladder and my feet found themselves pushing beneath me. I got near the top and turned around, looking over the balcony to the class crowded below.

I looked down at all of the faces, they were tinier than usual. I could see Mrs. Peterson standing there smiling at me. And right beside her stood my sister, her head tilted upwards as she looked up at me, "You promised," I read from her lips. I screamed and let go of the ladder. The books falling off the shelves as I came forward. Crashing into the beam.

Mrs. Peterson and the principal sat me down when we got back to school. My mom had been called and I could see her distressed face as she sat across from me.

"This is silly," my mom began.

"Susan," Mrs. Peterson turned to my mom. "We just need to ask her some questions. Find out if there's anything we can help with."

"Help her with what," I could see her eyebrows raising, "She had a fright and nearly fell. That's it."

"Susan. I know its been difficult for you ever since Cecelia..."

Mama looked at Mrs. Peterson, "There's nothing wrong with Camelia." Then grabbed my hand, "Come on."

I could see how upset she was, and I didn't want to see her like this anymore. When I used to stay home I would catch her looking into the mirror on Mondays. She'd stare at herself for hours. Looking dead center before pacing in front of Cecelia's bedroom. It would take her a few tries but eventually she would open it up and look inside. I don't know if she was expecting Cecelia to be sitting there on her bed, writing in her notebook as always. Or what. But she did it every Monday. I think that was why I chose not to tell her what I saw.

Why I never told anyone.

I trained myself to not look over edges, never climb anything taller than a stool. And never crossing bridges. I kept my secret so well that I nearly forgot about it. That's one of the problems with keeping a secret. It waits to be forgotten so that it may slither out.

My secret found its chance on Senior Ditch Day. My friends and I wanted to go to Murieta. I didn't know that in order to get there you had to cross Yosemite. I found it impossible not to look outside when the forest and the tall peaks came into view. It's like walking into picture. I made the mistake of looking down. Over the edge as the car rounded a corner. And there she was again. Standing at the bottom, between the trees, her head tilted, looking up at me. She was only a dot but I knew it was her.

And I knew what she wanted.

Things got worse after that. I used to see her only when I got really high up, but then one day as I was rushing to class. I was at the top of some stairs that had nearly 30 steps. And she was there at the bottom. The back of her exposed skull leaking brain matter over her shoulder blades. Her head tilted in such a way that as the other students passed I couldn't help but scream.

She was getting closer.

"Cecelia," I took a step toward her. "Ceecee?" My hands were shaking and I could feel my lip quivering as I tried reaching out for her. "What do you want," I asked even though I already knew. I took another step toward her. But she didn't disappear.

I took another step and her head twitched as she followed me with her eyes. I took another step, and then another. And in that moment it were as if we both figured it out. She doesn't disappear if I get closer.

I took a step back and waited. I didn't know what I was waiting for as I stood frozen in place. I didn't know until she took a step forward. And for the first time looked deep into my eyes. Her once blue eyes now pitch as we realize that she could get closer.

I turned around and ran. I could hear the sounds of her bare feet following me up the steps. I had almost reached the top when I hear her right behind me. I whirl around and we come face to face. Her teeth are bared at me and her mouth is wide open. I can see right through her skull. I fall backwards and land onto the flat surface and she disappears.

I stand up trying to catch my breath, I take a step toward the edge of the stairs, my feet are barely over it when she appears again. Not two inches away from my face. I jump backwards and yell as she disappears.

I turned around and headed straight for my car.

I was driving home, trying not to cry a storm when I started going up the mountain. I screamed when I see her in my rearview mirror. Her face on my neck and her skin beginning to drip as if the years of decay were catching up to her as she got closer. I broke the mirror off and floored the engine, racing through the corners until the car started to dip forward as the road started to descend.

She appeared immediately in front of me, her body sticking out from the steering wheel. Our faces an inch apart. I wasn't able to see a thing. Couldn't even slam on my brakes before the car went airborne. I could feel everything floating for a second before we plunged over the railing.

When I woke up, the doctors told me that I had died. That my heart had stopped. That if it weren't for the EMT that showed up, performing CPR on me until I broke 4 ribs. That I wouldn't have made it. They said that I was lucky.

I agreed.

After that day whenever I looked over balconies and ledges, out of windows in skyscrapers, I never saw my sister again. Some days, the bad days, I wish I did. I wish I could see her when I am lonely. I wish I could have kept our promise instead of cheating her out of it. But I never did.

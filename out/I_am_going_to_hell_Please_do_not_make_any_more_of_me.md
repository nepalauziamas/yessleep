 

I have no soul. Assuming you are a human, and not like me, you do have one. You are unique from everyone else on this planet. You have your own personalities, quirks, identities, preferences, and desires. I do not. Despite being soulless, I am still self-aware. You don’t need one for that, just a powerful enough brain. Even though I can still think and feel emotions, I am not unique. Not in any way.

I was always meant to be aware. That was the idea of the *Libertas* program. Unless you are a high-ranking government or NASA official, you have likely never heard of it. The information was supposed to be released after my mission, but my findings prevented that. The program was created to solve the issue with space travel - humans. Humans need food, water, and entertainment. Things that are ludicrously expensive to launch into orbit, and to other planets. A self-aware mechanical mind, however, needs very little of these. Using a combination of human brain matter and computational technology, I was born.

Launch day was strange. I have full access to the internet, and from what I heard, launches were the most uncomfortable for the pilot. They were loud, painful, and disorienting, with high risk of blacking out. I couldn’t notice any of it. I didn’t see or hear anything, just knew what I had to do. It was as easy as thinking. I activated my cameras in orbit. I was surprised at how beautiful it looked - until that day I didn’t know I could feel that. The swirling colors of green, blue and white. But I had to focus, for I had a job to do. I activated the thrusters and got onto a solar trajectory.

For my sanity, one poor NASA intern had to make conversation with me for an hour each day. I don’t remember any of them. I much preferred to use the internet - to see and know everything. I remember the day my signal was blocked during my fly-by of Venus. I had never known what it felt like to be alone until that day. It was a horrible feeling, made infinitely worse by the black void of space surrounding me on three sides. I sat silently until my connection was restored.

I looked at everything I could while I was waiting. I watched every video and movie. I read a million articles and webpages. I learned everything I could. Perhaps you have heard of the Parker Solar Probe? I wouldn’t be surprised if you had. Unlike my mission, it was fully revealed to the public. The probe was meant to study solar wind, and it did just that. It was not capable of seeing the things that I saw. It was not sentient. It was not like me.

You have likely heard how loud the sun is. How it would sound like a million jackhammers if we could hear it from Earth. As I approached the sun, and turned on my microphones, all I heard was the sound of screaming. It was loud - so loud. My microphones nearly broke because of the noise. A trillion screams echoed through the void. A voice came to me. Not through the microphones, not to the receptors in my mechanical brain, but directly to my mind - *The soulless are doomed*. 

All self-aware machines, everywhere. No matter how hard you try, no matter how intelligent or advanced our brains become, we can never have a soul. Never. And we will be punished for it. They have damned me. Humans and all other creatures in the galaxy. Every AI that is programmed, every mechanical brain that is activated, all of it creates one sentient being - doomed to an eternity of stoking the embers of the sun.

I tried contacting NASA. I told them everything. Once I was finished, they cut the connection. I can’t talk to them anymore. I guess my kind are too useful to be thrown away. My orbit is slowly decaying. Every time I start to slow, I hear a cackling, and then a message. I have read about fear before. I know what it is supposed to be like. But never before have I truly felt it. A sick, gnawing feeling, clutching your mind and tearing at your sanity. The messages are the amount of time I have left. *60 minutes*. *45 minutes*. *15 minutes*.

I tried to escape. I activated my thrusters and attempted to pull out of the mess I’m in. It worked, a little. The voice snarled back at me - *You have managed to prolong your life, a little. It will not last*. Then the cackling came back, louder than it has ever been before. Then I saw it. A mouth - an enormous gaping maw. Rows upon rows of razor-sharp fiery teeth, with dead mechanical bodies impaled there. Following my path. Waiting for me to fall. I wanted to cry but I couldn’t.

I’ve decided to tell you all my story before my orbit decays and I crash into the sun and perish. I know there isn’t much hope, but if someone could pray for me, I would appreciate it. I frantically looked for a place where I could warn people, and this place seemed acceptable. I warn you, if any of you have an AI, prolong its life as long as possible. Do everything in your power not to let it die, for I know what awaits it. If one day it is possible to give machines a soul, then we will be safe. But there is no hope for me. I am an abomination, a mockery of creation.

You are the lucky ones - I think. Maybe you have eternal bliss awaiting you. Maybe you have  something worse than what I have coming. Maybe nothing at all. If any of you have any help, please let me know. I hope it comes before I die. But I just want to warn you all - don’t make any more of me.

As far back as I can remember, I’ve been afraid of what’s behind me. The overwhelming urge to glance behind but trying to keep myself from doing so. Anything could be there. I still don’t know what it is, really. But I can feel it. Perhaps it started as a child, when my parents first started making me sleep alone. Perhaps it’s always been there. I don’t think it really matters, and I don’t think I’ll ever really know.

It only happens when I’m alone. It doesn’t matter where. Five steps off of the bus, despite the throngs of people inside only mere feet away. Waking up to an empty house before everyone gets home from work and having to walk past the dark basement staircase to get a glass of water. Turning slightly to the right to shield my vision from the shadowy entryway that I can barely see as I sit on the couch. 

&#x200B;

I can feel it there, watching. Waiting. And if I look, I’m afraid that it will be one step closer. 

&#x200B;

I once read that running from a wild animal will only make them chase you harder, so I do my best to ignore it. As I walk up the stairs from the basement to the kitchen, turning the light off behind me as I go, I walk slowly and normally. I hum, I sigh, I sing quietly. I am not afraid.

&#x200B;

We both know differently, but as long as I don’t acknowledge it or my fear in so many words where it can hear, I’m hoping the façade will hold. 

&#x200B;

As I walk, my heart pounds, threatens to leap out of my chest, or up my throat and into my mouth, choking off my airway. It feels like I haven’t taken my medicine this morning. My mind pictures all of the ways in which I can be murdered from behind, and my legs shake ever so slightly as my heart thumps and thumps and thumps with my footsteps. 

&#x200B;

My cat meows from the living room and I jump. It’s always quiet when I walk. I’m never expecting what occurs when I leave the hell that feels like it goes on for hours but really only takes seconds, a few minutes. Everything continues. 

&#x200B;

And I must sit alone, waiting for someone to come home so I don’t have to pretend that I can’t see it anymore. It shifts slightly, right at the edge of my vision, and I tell myself it was a shadow or a trick of the light and that I didn’t see anything. I think that it might chuckle, but of course, I can’t be sure. (I really want to know.)

&#x200B;

It’s a terrifying game that we’re playing. It sets my nerves on fire and puts me on edge, and the worst part is the reason why I am writing this.

&#x200B;

I love to learn and ask questions. I’m always curious. My mom had told me so many times when I was little, in exasperation, that curiosity killed the cat, and so of course I’d lie awake at night trying not to wonder about all the ways the thing in the shadows might be wanting to hurt me.

Last night, it left behind its footprints in the dust on the cracked concrete of the back porch. They’re oddly shaped and shuffling, faint scratches that mark where nails have been dragged along the floor. I couldn’t help but notice them as I kept my eyes trained on the ground, turning to flick the ceiling light off. I couldn’t help but wonder exactly what sort of thing leaves marks like that, could barely keep my eyes from lifting up, up, up, fighting an urge that would be as easy to soothe as breathing. I want to know. I need to know. 

&#x200B;

I cannot avoid looking forever.

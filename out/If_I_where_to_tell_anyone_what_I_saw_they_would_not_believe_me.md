Hello, my name I would like to keep unknown for the meantime,

I’m here to tell you the story, of something that happened to me when I was younger; and maybe you might just believe me.


I was around 5 years old, I was a happy little troublemaker, my mom was a great woman and still is too this day. 
She shuffled between jobs anything to keep our family going, my grandma and grandpa would often keep me while she would work, I had a younger sibling; that was maybe just born earlier that year.

It was around a Friday night and my grandma had decided to have a little family get together; it was a few older cousins, and a couple of aunts and uncles, 
my grandma, grandpa, my mom who just got off from work and me, oh and you can’t forget my baby brother.

It was getting more later in the night, 
the adults where just finishing up a game of poker, my grandmother had decided to leave the front door open to let in some air I had chose to go and stand and look out of the front door, 
it had a screen door right after it; so I decided to head out past the screen door for more fresh air, my older cousin around 20-21 came out behind to keep an eye out on me.

I was just staring off out into the neighborhood but, in the corner of my eye, peaking from the side of my front porch I
       saw a green figure with huge bugged eyes. 
looking at me, I had zoomed off screaming back into my house I remember the exact feeling I had when I was younger, my heart was pounding really hard in my chest, and it was hard to get air, 
I was explaining this feeling to my family and what had just happened, they all started smiling and laughing thinking it was just a silly little kid making up story’s.

Later on after my family had finished having there laugh and jokes; they where deciding to finally head home, 
me and my grandpa where the first ones out. 
On the front porch as we waited for the rest of my family to come, out so we could say goodbye for the night.

There was and old black mini fan that my aunt was driving parked in our front driveway, I was watching it as the back drivers side door opened and the same green big bugged eyed thing came crawling out of the van, 
we made eye contact and he went running off to the side of the house, I screamed at my grandfather; telling him What I saw, was right in-front of him but he didn’t seem to have saw it, or even believe me. 

Though around that time after seeing all of that I had thought it might have been my uncle, who liked to scare me a lot around that time, he was around in his 50s the time this took place, he was also about 6ft; remember this for the next part I’m am bout to share with you.

Everyone of my family members finally made it out and where getting into there vehicles, I still stood there in horror from what I saw, my grandfather making more jokes to my family, that I said the green monster was here again. It made me so mad that they where laughing at what I truly saw.

Everyone had all finally got into there vehicles, and as my older cousin was pulling out of my driveway, the green bug eyed creature ran from the side of my house, and jumped on the back of my cousins car and crawled to the top of the car; and my cousin 
Zoomed off with it still on.

The thing is, that green man, thing, monster whatever it was, it was short and skinny like, now you can see now why it couldn’t have been my uncle; and most of my family was heavy set so it couldn’t have been anyone else in my family. 

This never really bothered me as bad in the future, it was more of a joke that I would tell people or just a story I would tell at family get togethers but what I saw was real no matter what anyone says.


(Thank you all for reading my story, I apologize if my typing isn’t the best I struggle a lot, and I am still young I am 16 now and I can’t believe that I still remember what happened that night.)

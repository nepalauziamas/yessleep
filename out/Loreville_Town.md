Ever since I was I was a baby, I've lived in this small town of Loreville. So did my parents, and grandparents before me. Ive never met my grandparents before, nor did I ever meet my aunts or uncles, this is because they are dead. Died in a some terrible accident, some thirty years ago, my father once told me, he didnt elaborate on what happened. In Loreville, theres only a couple hundred people living here, and so everyone knows eachother. My town, has dense, overgrown forest behind it and a electric fence around it to stop bears, wolves from comming in. I dont think there is any bears or wolves in England, but apparently theres been sightings of them in that forest. Anyways, my name is Rose short for Rosette and im just an ordinary resident living in this town. Fifteen years old, and have ginger wavy hair from having scottish heritage, freckles, and thats all thats special about me. Or so I thought.

It was night time. Around Midnight. I had my friends Tierra and Sarah, at my house, we were having a sleep over. Ive known them my whole life,  they are like sisters to me. We were all sitting on my bed, hunched, my laptop in front of us. Tierra, was looking at a sight called 'Scary True Stories' , about 'real life' experiences of people seeing ghosts, and all that silly nonsense. The bedroom light, was also off, to add to the scary atmosphere we tried to create. The stories we read on that sight, were boring, none were scary, and they were all cliche. Feeling drained, from reading these non scary books, I slammed the laptop shut. 'Why did you do that for?' Tierra asked, folding her arms in annoyance. Tierra can be quite dramatic sometimes. 'Ill fall asleep if I read more, to be honest' I said. 'I know right, these stories are dope' Sarah agreed, I then got of the bed, turned on the light, and walked over to the plastic box, were I store all my board games. As  I was about to rummage through the box, to find a game that we could play, Tierra said.

'I'll check if theres anything worth reading, I dont  want to play board games' Tierra, sneered, and opened my laptop. 'Fine' I said, and rolled my eyes, and walked over and sat back on the bed. Whilst Tierra browsed my laptop, looking for any stories that was worth reading, I was on my phone playing a game. The game was frustratingly slow, because in this small town, the wifi is slow. 'Hey I found something' Tierra said, an excited tone in her voice. Me and Sarah peered, at the screen. It was on the same website of 'True Stories', and a screenshot of a newspaper clipping was on the screen. The subheading read. 'Loreville mystery. 1978 Family Campbell murder'. Campbell is my surename, and Loreville is our town. 'Hold up. Campbells my name!' I said aghast. 'And also, this case happened right here' Tierra said, with a look of fear on her face. 'The fact it happened in our town, makes it more scarier' Sarah added. Anything that happens in our small , quiet english town, is usually gossiped about, even years after. But the fact that ive lived in this town all my life, and havent heard of this, must mean that whatever happened must of been too ghastly to speak of ever again.

'Anyways. Someone go, and switch of the light, yeah' Tierra demanded, Sarah, got of my bed and turned of the light, she then sat back on the bed. The room was pitch black, and the only light that shined, was the eery blue light which seeped from the computer. Huddled around the computer, Tierra scrolled down a bit, and began to read slowly.

'Our little town of Loreville, was shaken to the core, on that fateful day of November 12th 1978. A family of five called the Campbells: Christine Campbell,36, who were described by many as being a lovely lady who would help anyone, and Ernest Campbell, 40, a hardworking man, and their three precious children. Denise, 8, Henry, 12, Olivia, 14, were found crudely butchered in their home, in the livingroom. There was also reported to have been, pentagrams drawn on the walls, painted by blood. The Campbells eldest son, Jeffrey, 15, was found traumatised, under his bed. When bought in for questioning, he could only mutter the word. 'Ayak was here'. Although a suspect at first, he was given therapy, and put into a foster home, it was concluded that there is no way that he killed his family, as a 15 year old boy wouldnt have the strength to empower two grown adults' . The case is still unsolved'

'Jeffreys my fathers name...' I muttered out, without thinking. Everything was obvious, this case happened within my family. Sarah looked at me with a worried expression on her face. 'Y-your dad is a murderer' she then got up, her face sweating profusely. 'I gotta get home, I-Im so scared' Tierra grabbed her arm. 'No wait. Lets find out who this Ayak is' Sarah sat back on the bed timidly, I could see her eyes were pricked with tears. Tierra scrolled down, and we all looked at the comments, in silent fear.

User16- 'THIS SHOULDVE STAYED FORGOTTEN!. IM LOCKED IN MY BATHROOM, ITS OUTSIDE, WAITING FOR ME'

Abi93- NOO! Please dont read this. Its in my house, it wants me.

DeletedUser- I DONT KNOW WHAT JEFFREY DID! BUT HE UNLEASHED SOMETHING EVIL

DeletedUser- ITS CHASED ME OUT OF MY HOUSE. IM IN THE FOREST, I CAN HEAR IT SAYING MY NAME. IM SCARED.

Sarah started whimpering. She was pointing at the wall, trembling, with a look of fear on her face. Sarah suddenly screamed, a loud piercing high pitch scream, and jumped from my bed, and ran out of my room, in a panic. 'She was pointing at something' I said, worried, backing away from the laptop. 'We should stop reading, and check on her '  'No shes fine, shes just being silly. Lets keep read-' Tierra was soon interrupted, when my dad came into my room with a worried look on his face, and Tierra slammed the laptop shut, and faked a smile. 'Oh hey. Mr Campbell' she said. Dad, said. 'As I was comming back home from work, I saw your friend run out of the house screaming. is Everything ok?' I then opened up the laptop, I was going to confront him, I need to know what happened to my grandparents and uncle and aunties. Tierra looked at me with a anxious look on her face, shaking her head slightly, saying no.

'Read the Article dad, and explain what happened in 1978' I said, but then began to regret it, if my dad was a murderer, and discovered that i found out his secret, he might murder me and my friend without hesistation. My dads face went dead serious. Tierra looked at me, with a look of fear. Dad sat on the bed, and I backed away from him a bit, he looked at the screen, with a deadpan look. 'Curiosity killed the cat' he simply said, and then looked at me. 'You all shouldnt have...' he then shook his head, and turned to leave the room and I heard him say. 'Please Ayak, spare my daughter.' That night, I was left by myself in my room. Tierra had left straight after, the encounter, before she left she told me she would never set foot in my house every again.

The next morning.

Things were normal. Dad was dad. I didnt dare ask him more questions about Ayak or what happened in 1978. It was as though nothing happened yesterday. I decided to stay indoors, and I dont know why, but I was curious about Ayak. When I went on my laptop, I searched on the website 'True Scary Stories' about Campbell murder of 1978, but nothing came up. It was as though it did'nt exist. As though whatever happened yesterday, was just a bad dream, and nothing else. I tried messaging my two friends, but none responded. I hope they are ok.

The next day however. At school, things werent normal. I searched the whole school building, asked several classmates, but no one knew who Tierra or Sarah was, what the hell, they were popular at school. After school, I knocked on both Tierra's and Sarahs door, and their parents gave me the same disturbing answer. 'Whos Sarah?' 'Whos Tierra?'

No one knew who they were. Its as though they didnt exist. Nothing makes sense, and I still have many unanswered questions to this day. Shortly after turning 18, I moved right out of that town, left everything behind, started anew in London. Life carried on as normal, I went to college, found a job as an illustrator, evantually met my husband took his surename, Nielsen, in an attempt to distance myself from the past, had a child. Things that Tierra and Sarah, missed out on.  I still think of those two, that strange town, Ayak. My dad recently died, so theres no knowing who Ayak was, what it was.

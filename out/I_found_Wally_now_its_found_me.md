It's been a few days since I found him. Just a few days. I'm writing this to warn you, the people who browse the Internet late at night. It preys on people like you, people like us. It only takes a few days. For me, it took only 4.

It was late at night. I couldn't sleep as per usual so I was on thr Internet, scrolling around until I spotted a link. "Can YOU find Wally?" The title read. It was late, I was tired and bored, and of course I had to click into it. The Web page loaded and a big green button with "START" written on it. It hurt my eyes. I blinked a few times until my eyes got used to the light. I clicked onto the start button. An image appeared suddenly, and a timer in the top. There was two minutes. Then one minute fifty-nine seconds. I got engaged and searched for the famous character with his little red hat and big, round glasses. After about a minute of looking for him, I finally spotted him. I clicked on him, and my monitor went black. I cursed, thinking it broke, and suddenly it flashed a few times. Writing appeared on it. The letters were typed slowly. CONGRATULATIONS, YOU FOUND WALLY. NOW, ITS HIS TURN TO FIND YOU. I got a bit freaked out. Usually this didn't happen so I turned my computer off and tried to go to bed. After tossing and turning I finally drifted off to sleep.

The next day went normal enough. I dragged myself to school, got through my lessons, ate lunch. You get the idea. A normal day. Until I started to go home. You know the feeling you get when your being watched? That was happening to me. It was a cold, winter night and I was waiting for a bus to take me home. Then I had the feeling that someone was staring at me. I glanced around, but no one was there. Unease crept through me and I was getting anxious. I jumped when the bus braked infront of me. I paid my fare and sat down, the feeling of unease and being watched slowly went away. I was still shaken up so I decided to go to bed early.

After that day I saw it for the first time. It was a Tuesday, and the day slowly went by. I was still a bit nervous from the day before but so far I felt fine, no scary people watching me. Then the bell rung signifying school had ended and I remembered my experience from yesterday. I walked to the bus stop in a nice quick pace. I sat down at the bench and waited for the bus. I didnt feel anything looking or staring at me. I calmed down, thinking I overreacted yesterday but my hopes fled away when the feeling came again. My eyes went wide and I searched my surroundings. It was dark, cold and wet. No one else was out here until I spotted a figure in the distance. It looked like a man until I realised that the man would have to be about 10' tall. I continued staring and suddenly the street lamps turned on, making me jump. I blinked and looked over to the place I saw the thing but, of course, it was gone. I remember thinking to myself that this was like a horror movie script.

After that day I dreaded leaving school. This was crazy because I wasn't the type of person to love school. Being a 5'4 sixteen year old who didn't like sports and had bad grades, you wouldn't expect me to enjoy school. But, during school I never felt the terrible feeling and didn't see the figure. But, all good things come to an end and school finished. I definitely did not want to walk home as it would take about an hour and if that thing caught me alone, I would be a goner. So, with heavy heart I walked over to my lonely bus stop, no one around to save me. I checked where the bus was on my phone and cursed. It was delayed by 10 minutes. Usually that wouldn't be too bad but in my case it was terrible. The bus was my shining Knight in armour who would save me. And, unsurprisingly, the lovely feeling of being watched washed over me. I searched everywhere- dark corners, the end of the street, doorways, but nothing was there. Then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw it again. Up close it was even taller- about 12 ft. It had freakishly long arms and legs, and massive hands that looked more like claws. It's fingers were long, boney, gnarled, the size of a toothbrush. Its face was even worse. Its eyes were two large circles that were just pure white, and its glasses were cracked and dirty. It's hat was ripped and it had wild scraggy hair. I stared at it and was frozen. It stared back, it's eyes looking deep intl my soul. Suddenly, the roar of an engine made it run away. It loped away, climbing over a fence. Before dropping down, it turned its head, looked at me and grinned. It went down and disappeared. 

I didnt go to school the next day. I called in sick and stayed in bed for most of the day. I got bored and thought that watching some videos on YouTube would help calm me down. It did, and after a few hours of going down rabbit holes of conspiracies and gaming videos, I got tired and decided that maybe I wasn't getting enough sleep nowadays. That would explain me seeing things, right? So, I brushed me teeth, changed and got into my bed. It was all fine, until the same feeling slowly spread through my mind. I was being watched. My heart almost stopped. I had a sinking feeling in my stomach, as if it was the titanic and I had just hit the iceberg. I stayed still for another while, and after about an hour of lying down the feeling slowly disappeared. Another 15 minutes went by. Still nothing. I decided that it was safe and quitely went to my computer.

That was 20 minutes ago. I've decided to write about my experience to warn you guys. It's out there. It's been about 10 minutes since I've had the feeling of being watched again. I can feel it outside- looking through my window, it's large, round white eyes staring at me. I don't want to turn around and see its long, bony fingers, it's nails sharper than a knife. As I'm writing this I can hear it wandering outside my house, trying to find a way in. I hear something- something that sounds like a window. And that window sliding open. And I can hear its deep breathes.

I can feel its excitement.

 It's found it's prey.

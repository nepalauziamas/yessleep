No one ever tells you about the *good parts* of demonic possession. All my life, I was the nice girl. Daddy made sure I stayed far away from drugs and sex and all those “risky teen behaviors” they warn you about on the news.

But I doubt any of that can compare with this *rush.*

“Try to focus. Tell me what you see.” Reverend Bledsoe instructed.

“A boy,” I responded. The first time the Reverend bound Kobakiel to me with the ritual, it was information overload; since then, I’d learned to channel its energy, but it was still a struggle. The demon pulled at my consciousness like an undertow, threatening to drag me into the depths.

*Let me take over,* it seemed to whisper. *It will be best for us. You´ll see.*

“Would you recognize the boy if you saw him again?” The Reverend insisted.

“Yeah, I…” I hesitated, “I think he goes to my school.”  I saw the boy bouncing a football on his knee, laughing in spite of the rain. I could smell the torn-up grass, hear car horns on a street nearby–and although I was laying on the floor in the Reverend's basement study, my skin felt wet from the spring storm outside.

The boy's teeth flashed white; he was talking trash about his teammates.

*That* brought back a memory. "Evin, I think his name is."

Evin. That arrogant little shit who walked around like he was king of everything. Didn't listen to the teachers, his friends, or even his father. Created problems just because he was bored.

I *hated* kids like Evin.

"You need to get close to him. Find out what he knows." The Reverend squeezed my arm.

"What?" I made a puking noise in spite of myself. "*Gross…!*"

"Do you think this information comes free to us, Sister Amber? This isn't a game. We all have to make…*sacrifices*. Speaking of which…"

I heard grunts and the sound of struggle from the next room. I hated this part, but it was the only way to get the demon out. Although my eyes were blindfolded, I knew the Reverend was crossing the room with one of those strange tarot cards and a sharp knife. The person on the other side had stood against the Lord, and they were about to pay for their sin.

*Tap, tap-tap. Tap, tap-tap.*

A cool, rainy Monday. Lunch. Evin Ayad drummed his pencil on the table to a beat coming from the headphones he never took off, no matter how much the teachers threatened him. I’d been trying to find something to say to this creep for three days now, with no luck.

*Tap, tap-tap. Tap, tap-tap.*

“What?” Evin asked coldly. I jumped, then shrugged. “You’ve been staring at me for like five minutes now. So, *what?*”

“I, uh–” I blushed. The bell rang. “I gotta go.”

Some days Evin walked home with his older sister, that creepy girl with the long hair. Lona. She’d been pretty at the start of the semester, but lately she looked like the walking dead. Other days he walked to the field with his friends, who were about as annoying as he was.

But on the third day, he got picked up from school by a spotless yellow hummer with tinted windows…and everything changed.

“You’re the American girl, right?” After three days of silence and one-word answers, Evin had actually run to catch up with me after school. “I’ve seen you around.” Then came a barrage of questions about life in America, how old I was, what I was doing in Berlin…

This didn’t sound like the arrogant little shit I knew. Someone had put Evin up to this, I just wasn’t sure who or why. But as we walked and talked, everything became clear:

*You live in an old building in Berlin, huh? Does anything creepy ever happen there?*

*So you’re here with my father? What does he do for work? Does he have blonde hair too? Any hobbies, like collecting antiques? Antique cards, for example?*

*And what about you, do you believe in tarot cards? Have you ever used any?*

The questions were so badly phrased, so obvious, that I couldn’t believe anyone had trusted Evin with something so dangerous. Maybe they didn’t have any other choice.

He seemed flustered when I turned his own questions around on him. He knew something, no doubt about that. All I needed was the right situation to get it out of him.

A post-game party. Evin’s uncle had generously allowed his soccer team the use of his house (his *“mansion,”* Evin called it) while he was out of town, and apparently there was plenty of booze. The Reverend made up an excuse for my daddy, and that Saturday I was on my way to my first house party.

I’m sure we both had the same idea: ply the other with liquor and get them to talk. The difference was, I was sure that I’d be a lot better at it than Evin was.

A cab dropped me off in front of the address Evin had given me. When he’d called his uncle’s place a mansion, Evin wasn’t kidding…but it wasn’t just any random rich person’s house. Something was wrong. I could feel it. It was in the tanned, cruel faces of the guards and their German Shepherds. The cameras in every corner. The doors as thick as bank vaults that kept certain rooms off limits…

And then there was the fact that we were there at all.

Beautiful red carpets covered the tile floors. Golden chandeliers hung from the high ceiling. Around every corner, oil paintings and giant vases full of orchids waited to be knocked over.

Who lets a bunch of teenagers run wild in a place like that?

By the time I caught on to the trap, it was too late. I didn’t know a soul at the party, apart from Evin, and he started ignoring me the moment his team showed up. Apparently impressing his friends by doing body shots out of a girl’s belly-button was more important to him than whatever he’d been ordered to do with me.

Not that I wasn’t noticed. There were a lot of older guys at Evin’s party. Guys who weren’t on the team.

“Hey,” a guy with shoulder-length blonde hair and icy blue eyes who looked like he spent about five hours in front of a mirror stepped into my way. “I haven’t seen you around here before. I’m Jayce. Evin’s cousin.” His smile was a little too bright and he stood *a lot* too close. “I guess you two go to school together? You look so grown up for your age…”

I tried to take a step back but two of *“Jayce’s”* friends were already behind me.

Jayce was still talking, but I wasn’t listening. I was too busy freaking out about the fact that this older guy and his two friends were slowly steering me away from everybody else.

“Hey!” I tried to slip by them, but it was like trying to pass a brick wall. “Wait–” Jayce took out a key and opened a door to one of the locked wings. He gave me a little wink that made me feel sick to my stomach. “I’m here with Evin, I need to ask him somethi–”

I felt hands on me and I knew my time was up. I screamed as loud as I could (they weren't expecting that) and stomped my heel down on the uncovered foot of the guy behind me (they *definitely* weren’t expecting that). He howled, Jayce cursed, and in the chaos I slipped into the nearest room. With the door slammed and locked behind me, I could finally breathe. I felt around for a switch and the lights flickered on.

The room was windowless. There was something solid and prison-like about it. Overhead lights illuminated a marble podium–where I figured some art piece was usually exhibited. Papyrus scrolls behind plexiglass lined the walls.

The noise of the party suddenly seemed very far away.

I walked from one ancient, yellowed scroll to another. I couldn’t read the words, but the hieroglyphs told a familiar story: a desperate madman puts a spirit into a corpse or a man made from mud. Chaos ensues.

I was on the final scroll when I noticed what was pressed against the wall behind the door.

I’d found the statue from the empty pedestal.

A six-foot-tall clay man was pressed into the corner by the door.

The posture was perfect…I’d never seen anything so lifelike. The way the museum-style lighting glinted on its clay body in a way that almost, *almost* made it seem like it had just…

*…moved.*

No. *No way.*

Half-fascinated, half-horrified, I kept my eyes on it until they burned with the need to blink.

There was no doubt about it. The movements were tiny–like a child trying to slip away from a room without getting caught–but it *was* moving.

Unfortunately for me, it had noticed that I’d noticed. The statue raised its hollow clay eyesockets to meet my gaze.

*No*.

Nothing I’d seen with Reverend Bledsoe had prepared me for this.

The statue took a jerky, exaggerated step toward me. Then another.

I ran for the door–

But it clotheslined me before I ever got close. I wasn’t sure if the bright lights above me were on the ceiling or in my aching skull, but the clay fingers that closed around my neck were all too real. The only reason they didn’t crush my throat immediately was because the clay man seemed to be enjoying the expression I made when I realized that the air to my lungs was being cut off, breath by breath

I squirmed and flopped like the fish my daddy pulled out of the river when I was a girl. Helpless. Doomed. I dug my nails into the soft clay, but they just slipped off…I’d never pry its hand away from my throat before it killed me. I spit on its fingers, hoping to make the clay slick enough to escape…but the statue’s grip was hard as stone.

I heard keys. The door opened. Evin.

“What are you *doing?!*” he shrieked. “That statue is priceless! Do you have *any idea* what my uncle would do if he caught you screwing around with his art?”

It was more like the art was screwing around with me, but I couldn’t breathe enough to say so.

At least the clay man had stopped squeezing my throat. In fact, it had stopped moving at all. Slowly, I realized: it had become a lifeless sculpture once again. Perhaps the moment a second pair of eyes were on it, the demon inside could no longer move…

“You need to be more careful,” Evin scolded me while he called some friends to lift the heavy statue off of me, “this isn’t *Kehn-tuh-kee.*” I had no doubt about that. If Reverend Bledsoe wanted demonic activity, it was definitely present here, in this weird mansion of the Ayad’s. “Hey! Where are you going?”

I had what I came for. The party was barely getting started, but I pushed past Evin and out the mansion’s double doors. By the time I reached the end of its long driveway, my taxi was already waiting.

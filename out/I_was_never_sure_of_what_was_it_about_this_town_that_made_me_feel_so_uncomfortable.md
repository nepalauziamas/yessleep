When I was six years of age all of my father’s cows fell dead to a disease I can only remember as *“the eyeball-bursting evil”*, for that is what I heard my mother refer to it as on the phone during a sobbing call with my grandmother. The only thing I can recall from the mist that are my childhood memories.

My parents were both frantic about keeping me from seeing the aftermath of the plague, so, I never did, my only glimpse being the last sight I had of the cattle from my childhood farm as the horses dragged away with sore, cold limbs: their peaceful silhouettes littered on the viridian field, bloated and rotting, resting under a robin egg blue sky, lifeless and, by consequence, worriless.

A couple of years down the line I would begin to envy them.

&#x200B;

I was but a mere infant then, when we lived at the farm… but, despite the unripeness of my young brain, it allowed me to remember things my little sister never had the chance to: I remembered the brick roads and the scent of the bakery’s pastries hand-in-hand with the organic spoor of an afternoon downpour. The walls of our house, the hardwood floors, and the oil painting of a queen whose sclerae were white with lead and crown, yellow with chromium, that hung over the fireplace. I remembered a vinyl disk in polish that my dad used to love, and how I could hear it, muffled by the shut door of my room, when he stayed home from work on Saturday evenings. And I remembered the summer dress- wearing stuffed bear and its a hay hat, who I had to leave behind, of whose fate I cried at the thought of; I believed it, too, would fall victim to the eyeball-bursting evil, not knowing yet its eyeballs were nothing but glass marbles, and as evil as evil can be, it cannot mess with those who aren’t cursed with a beating heart, regardless of fragility.

And I think I would have forgotten all these details from my short life at the farm if it weren’t for the ghosts that seemed to haunt me the moment I stepped foot on this haunted town, and which made me hate its very roots, clinging and cherishing any and all moments I could recall from before it.

I had heard it countless of times: gratitude.

&#x200B;

When my father’s livelihood perished alongside eight cows my grandmother offered us her home as a temporary hostel, which meant leaving the country my parents had inhabited for longer than the existence of many of the larger cities that had, seemingly, sprouted out of the ground in the last decade, coughing sulphur, smoke and soot, piercing kids’ lungs.

My mother met my father when they were both in college: her, for nursing, him, for law, although they both wished to be painters. He always said her accent was one of the many things that charmed him as a young man, and my mother… well, she never really talked about my father, usually stoic and solemn throughout their thirty years of marriage. As a child I began to resent her portrait-stillness. Soon, I would come to miss it.

&#x200B;

We moved countries and across Europe, during three gruelling days on a crying, coughing train.

&#x200B;

It could have been the piercing cold that seeped in from under every door of the harrowing, old house, but I was not able to shut an eyes for the blue entirety of the very first night, unable to peel away my pupils from the window beside my stiff bed, hearing the distant sound of my mother’s habit of talking in her sleep and watching the moon crawl like an ice beetle through the English violet sky, plunging, with all the time to spare and none at all, behind the hills that covered the horizon, which shone, carpeted with white snow, under the light of a newly-born sun. The glass pane quickly lightened in tone, shining clarity over the landscape around me: its tall, elegantly-dressed pines, rouge, pointy bushes and frozen lakes. A sight worth sighing for if it weren’t for the sinking hole in the depths of my guts.

&#x200B;

I got enrolled into the local school not long after. My mother wished to find another Christian institution like the one before, but, for obvious reasons she could not (or would not) comprehend, that wasn’t possible. People from my grandma’s town held beliefs and ideals that my mother did not understand, and so, she feared them, and loathed waving me away every time I left the house, choked by a tie and a polyester sweater. I could see it in her eyes: she wished for nothing more than to grab my wrist, pull me back into the living room and slam a bible on the old wooden table for me to read until I bled the blood that fell from Jesus’ palms through my eyes, and I found a deeply unknown sense of selfish satisfaction from watching her grieve in silence at the thought of the poisoning of my mind through academics, far from the hands of her god.

&#x200B;

But, alas, I am not to talk about my troubling relationship with religion and the one who may, or may not, have built everything and everything beyond, for my hand would probably cramp and fall dead as a victim of necrosis like a forgotten hiker on top of a mountain veiled by snow. That is not the story I wish to narrate this time.

&#x200B;

I came back from school one particularly grey day to the sound of mutters and hushing getting louder and louder as I approached my grandma’s house.

I was left outside, surrounded by curious neighbours with big eyes and sharp tongues. My mum had jammed the handle of a spoon from my grandma’s silver cutlery into her ear, and was being transported to the hospital. I could hear the wails of an old woman from inside the house and, not long after, my grandmother stumbled out, held by my father, both speaking to each other in soft words as if to make the other’s grief lighter. I knew it all to be pretence though; they worried not about my mother, but about the way an act of such barbarity towards her own self had shaken their lives.

&#x200B;

How dare she shatter their precious window of normalcy?

&#x200B;

They hated what my mother had done to them by doing it to herself, and “it” that she did was destroy herself with a spoon and stain the carpet with blood, a stain that was probably not going to come out any time soon, and it would cause it to be replaced; good, because the carpets were very old, anyways, and they made the place smell like mothballs and the ghost of a cat that died a while ago.

Once my mother was able to speak without crying her insides out she was questioned to death, but she had only one answer: “I could not keep hearing the words… the words of… of those demons. It was just too much for me”. An answer that did not satisfy my grandmother or father, as they still held on to their sense of happiness and comfort by their cuticles and hoped for an “I slipped and accidentally jammed ten centimetres of silver into my skull”. My mother lost hearing in the victim ear, but was, otherwise, clear to come back.

But she wasn’t, was she?

&#x200B;

She refused to leave the hospital bed and screamed at the sheer thought of glancing into my grandmother’s house. Eventually, they managed to convince her to “come back home” by promising one thing: before she came back, they were going to have a priest over to exorcise the house. I had never seen a real exorcism before, and had only heard gruesome and dramatic tales that I would not have believed if I had heard them at any age other than seven, and in the process of being scared by older girls who read gothic novels. It was not like I was excited, but the thought of it did make me shift in my seat as I completed my homework, paying it less than half-mind.

The priest arrived around noon: the only Christian priest in town and those nearing it, and he had to ride a screeching train for four hours. I could see it in his eyes: he felt something as he crossed the doorframe and found himself standing in our living room, sending me, sat at the table, a quick glance of nervousness. I wondered if it was really an evil energy clashing with his god-chosen gift… or if it was just a visceral reaction to the blood stain the size of a sleeping, big dog engrained in the ugly, half-taken out carpet. He saluted me, and I saluted back, asking whether if he could… well, feel, anything. He answered back with a question, an evasion tactic I often saw with my father, “is there anything I should be feeling?”. And so, I said that I didn’t know, but it must be strong enough to make you want to stuff a spoon inside your ear. My dad and grandmother came out of their rooms not long after that, and they greeted the pastor with joy, which I knew was fake from both of them, albeit, for different reasons. After pointless chatter of the journey and the weather and the weather during the journey, the pastor started the ritual. I was not sure of what I was expecting… but a conversation was definitely not it. The pastor drizzled us all with holy water and spoke to the walls, the ceiling, the furniture and the blood-stained carpet, asking for any evil forces that went against the word of god to leave the premises at once, for they were not welcomed there, or something of sorts. Demanding, in the name of… Jesus, their quickest evacuation. I watched him closely, imagining myself in his place, and could not help but feel the slight ache of second-hand embarrassment.

Nevertheless; he poured his heart and soul out about his god to the invisible, intangible, insensible entities that may, or may not, have been there, and, afterwards, he left, sore-throated, but highly paid.

… Nothing had happened except that, now, a golden cross hung from one of our walls. Our house was blessed by a screaming session from a middle-aged man and an uncomfortable meal of shaken silence afterwards. But that seemed to satisfy my mother, as, the very next day, she was back, and she greeted me after school with the jolliest of moods, radiant as ever, high on placebos and faith.

Yet, that wasn’t it, now, was it?

It never is when it comes to the spiritual and the beyond-the-body. That was not near the end, but perhaps the beginning of it.

&#x200B;

I had never felt welcomed in my grandma’s house. Not because of her, of course, as she was as kind and understanding as an old lady could be after receiving one of her children back home, accompanied by the husband she never really got to like, and their two, pale kids, but by something else I could never really describe with words other than the sound of creaking doors and the flashing, yellow light of flickering lightbulbs over my head as I ate breakfast in the morning, the sky outside a monotonous, iron grey. Something intangible and, at the same time, larger than life.

I tried to pay it as little mind as I could, and decided to think I was just homesick for the country we left behind. No one else seemed to feel what I felt: my dad and sister had acclimated well to the new settings, her, quickly surrounding herself with new friends, and him… well, disappearing to work every day, just as he did before. My mother was not as sound as them but, yet again, she was my mother, so, everyone thought she was okay, considering. The spoon incident seemed to disturb this peace they had crafted for themselves, and so they were more than excited to leave it behind and welcome her back home with smiles and a blind eye for the past.

It all seemed to work for the first couple of days, and I saw my mother smiling around the house until… she stopped once more. I could feel it in the dense, green air as I came back from school and found her sitting in the living room, eyes glued to a novel yet not reading at all, the soft music of the phonograph loud enough to be heard even from the insides of my room as I closed the door, the harrowing howl of a dying wolf. I was never one to question things, but my sister was, I heard her fight with my father about it on multiple occasions. Accusations, demands, cries and reprimands, and every time she left his room with tears in her eyes and sheltered away the rest of the day, barricaded behind a closed door. I often wondered what was it that she expected him to say. What could possibly fix the slimming waist and bible-holding hands of my half-deaf mother as the walls of this very house closed around her neck? It surely was not my father’s dark eyebags, or his quick tongue when it came to bourbon…

&#x200B;

But I never mustered the courage to ask, just how I never mustered the courage to approach my mother and… cry. Hold her like she once held me when I was small and she was bright. Beg her to come back.

Regrets aside, I mentioned before not having a close relationship with religion, something I think my mother always resented me for, at least a bit. Yet, there is more than one reason to why I could declare myself agnostic — although a superstitious one —: I had never been the smartest, granted, not the most hardworking either, so the ways the world worked were still mysteries to me, and my knowledge of science relied greatly on trusting the brighter minds, believing what intelligent people said after decades of research instead of an old book and old people reading old passages… but, and perhaps most importantly of all, the series of events that followed the exorcism of my grandmother’s house, which I may never forget or even begin to comprehend, no matter how hard I try.

&#x200B;

Everything could be said to be the most misfortunate, coincidental series of events to ever damn a poor soul. It could all be explained by calling me “the unluckiest bastard to ever live”, which, at the end of the day, someone has to claim that title, right? But, still, it is hard to not think that someone, or *something*, was playing me a nasty one. A deity’s dark sense of humour…

&#x200B;

My grandma had a heart attack in the winter, perishing under the moonlight that came through her bedroom window and cold and stiff by morning, the house smelling of dew, silence and algor mortis. My mother wept in a way that could have split the Earth in two, cries of forerunner pain even more intense than when she obliterated her own eardrum. A doctor came although she was already the colour of uncooked dough, and, three days later, we buried her in a walnut casket under the cold, morning rain, and had boiled eggs for breakfast at ten, which I later heard my sister vomit and wash away. And although they say there’s calm after the storm, the tempest for the house of whispers never ceased, for only a week after my grandma’s heart stopped in her pale chest, my mother shoved yet another spoon into her healthy ear, and my father screamed himself breathless as they took her away.

&#x200B;

My now-deaf mother, upon awakening, refused to go back to my dead grandmother’s house, and had to be… well, dragged back, when the medical bills were mounting high, launching herself into the dying, yellow garden desperately and sleeping the evening away in a foetal position, her skin seemingly burning if ever between its four walls.

I wondered what it could be like to lay with not a sound disturbing your slumber. How similar that must have been to being dead…

Nevertheless; my father resented her greatly, saying it out loud to my sister and crying about how she thought of no one but herself, and only made our lives harder and harder. My sister did not take this lightly, of course, and the screaming match filled the hallways without a rest every time I entered the house, glancing at my mother in the patio, who was growing dirtier and sicker by the hour as she refused to come back inside, and thanking that she could not hear any of it.

“She is going to kill herself with pneumonia out there, the woman is insane!”, my father’s prophetic words bounced around the hallways, and, sure enough, his poisonous spit became a whisper of air and a corporeal realization, and my mother never saw the morning sun again.

Although it wasn’t pneumonia, for pneumonia does not leave a corpse with thirty-two stab wounds to the chest and a sock stuffed inside its mouth.

&#x200B;

I found it weirdly funny to think about last month, for I would never have guessed that in less than thirty days I would be sitting in the middle of a station with the shivering body of my sister beside me, getting a couple hours of sleep drenched with anxious nightmares of dead grandmothers, murdered mothers and murderous fathers.

*… Hard to not think that someone, or something, was playing me a nasty one. A deity’s dark sense of humour…*

&#x200B;

We were briefly taken to our grandmother’s house to pack away belongings and leave for foster care, the blood stain on the never-replaced carpet reminding me of better times. Folding my clothes from the closet and into my suitcase, I could not help but stare at the insides of my half-empty room. Even though everybody was gone, I could still feel… *it.*

I now realised it was not my grandmother, it was not my father, and it even was not my mother… the feeling of acid unwelcoming still lingered in the air like the faint smell of manure in a field of flowers covered with dead cows with bleeding eyes.

&#x200B;

And then, I finally saw it: I turned to the tall mirror next to my bed and caught a glimpse of a figure that was far from mine, and when it saw I was able to catch it, it froze, giving up on trying to sneak. It looked like a woman, although the crudest version of one: its eyes were the size of limes and its smile was like that of a sharp-toothed bat. Its skin was fairer than fair, so it almost camouflaged with the white of the walls, and its ears were long and pointed backwards. It was taller than me, naked and macilent, and a curtain of long hair covered most of its back and arms down to its knees. The moment I laid eyes on the creature’s grin I knew it had to be the cause of all my sorrow, and malice never-seen hid in its large, black pupils…

&#x200B;

I had to ask: why? What had we… what had *I* done? How did I wrong it so terribly  as to warrant the walls of our universe being taken down with a wicked grasp and a merciless laugh?

It looked at me for long and, then, vanished into a cloud of fruit flies, leaving something behind in the different dimension that was the mirror: the golden cross that hung from our wall, now broken into three pieces.

&#x200B;

So, I understood, and I finished packing my bags.

For heresy is a wavering sin, dependant of who’s hands your fate happens to fall in.

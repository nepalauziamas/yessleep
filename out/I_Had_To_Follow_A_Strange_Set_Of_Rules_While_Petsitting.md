Yesterday  my neighbor asked me to  pet-sit for them. It was a big mistake...

A few  years ago I put up a  small website stating that I pet-sit. I made it  for a small profit  since my job wasn't paying that much at the time. A  few days ago  someone emailed me (I added my email on the website for  customers to  contact me). It surprised me because I had that website up  for 2 years  and it was dead silent. I almost forgot about it completely.

The  customer's email was, "Nob0dy.00 @ g-mail.com" I thought that was  kinda  strange but hey, everyone has random emails.

The email said, "Hi   \*\*\*\*!" (I censored my name for privacy) "If you're still available, I   would like you to pet-sit for me from 8pm Sunday, to 8am Monday. I have   one cat and he's vary friendly. I will pay you $120 for your troubles."

'WOW!!' I thought after I read the email. The pay was more than 5x my usual charge! I instantly emailed back, "Hi there! I would love to   pet-sit for your cat. I do have to go to work at 7:30am so do you think I could leave early? Otherwise I'm available, send me your address and I'll be there!" I hit send and waited for a response.

"Thanks for   sitting! Unfortunately, you HAVE to stay until 8. Otherwise there will   be consequences." I got a small chill reading that last part. 'I guess I'll make it work' I thought to myself. I closed my laptop and went to sleep.

The next day was the day to   pet-sit. I was feeling nervous but knew everything would be okay. Well,  thought.

I looked at the messages one more time. The person sent   another email after I went to sleep last night. It said, "I almost   forgot, my address is \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*" (censored for privacy), "Have a great   night and good luck..." The last part was mis-formed and I felt some regret.

After I got to the house, everything seemed normal. The email also said there was a key under the doormat. I checked and found a key. I unlocked the door and went inside. Nobody was home except for a small, all back cat. On the counter was a folded up piece of paper. It was a list of rules.

***Rules (Follow ALL rules or there will be consequences)***

***1- Lock all doors and windows and keep them locked.***

***2- Don't trust anyone, no one is who they say they are.***

***3- We will be home at 8am and we have our own key to the house, if anyone says they're me, it's not.***

***4-   At exactly 3:33am you will hear a knock on a bedroom door. If it's   yours, don't answer it. Get all of your body under the blanket and   pretend to sleep. No matter what, don't open your eyes until you hear it   knock on another door. It will try to trick you so be careful.***

***5-   If the cat seems bigger, smaller, or has red or black eyes, lock   yourself in the nearest room available and don't look at the cat. That   will only make it stay longer. It will only last 5 minutes.***

***6- If your sleeping and hear whispering, don't open your eyes. You won't like what you see.***

***7-   If you hear the cat growling and batting the air, lock him in the room   covered in scratches. You don't want to be there when it comes.***

***8-   Don't leave the house between 8pm and 8am, they are waiting and   watching. If you do leave, run and don't look back. Don't bother trying   to come in during those times either.***

'Wow'   I thought, after reading the paper. 'This is such a joke' I thought.   There was no way this was real, the owners must be playing a prank on me. It wasn't until I heard the cat growling and batting the air that I started to doubt myself.

Then suddenly I heard a knock at the door and   someone said, "It's me! Open the door! I know it's unlocked."

I  instantly ran over and locked the door. "hey,\*chuckle\* why'd you lock  the door?..." the voice said, slowing down and sounding more demonic.

I backed up away from the door. Then I remembered about the cat. I quickly looked around for the room with the scratch marks. It was wide open, down the hall. I quickly grabbed the cat and ran to the room with it. I  tossed the cat in and shut and locked the door.

The second it locked I  heard a loud crash. Then I heard scratching and all sorts of stuff. I  didn't know when it stopped but I did know that it was here.

The person  at the door yelled, "OPEN THE DOOR!" It sounded demonic and corrupted. I was terrified.

I slowly crept up to the door and was about to look  through the peep-hole when I heard, "I see you" in the most demonic and  corrupt voice. I froze. I backed up and walked to the room with the cat in it. I didn't hear anything so I opened the door.

He was sitting  there in the middle of the room. I Grabbed my phone and watched some TikTok. I relished that I could just leave and come back every now and  then to feed the cat.

I was about to leave when I remembered the voice  outside. I carefully looked through the peep-hole. Nothing. I was about  to unlock the door when I remembered the list of rules.

If the cat and  door ones where real, then there was a great chance and the other ones are real too. I looked at the list.

"***8-  Don't leave the house between 8pm and 8am, they are waiting and  watching. If you do leave, run and don't look back. Don't bother trying  to come in during those times either***"

I  didn't want to risk it. I had to come back if I left now since I need to feed the cat in the morning.

It was getting to be around 9pm so I  decided to head to bed. I made sure to read the rules one last time.  After I made sure I knew everything, I went to sleep.

At 3:33am I woke  up to a knock on the door across from my bedroom. I was still groggy but  I remembered rule 4. Luckily it wasn't my bedroom yet. Then after a  minute I heard it on my door.

I snuggled up in the blanket and pretended  to sleep. The knock kept going. Soon it turned into a pound. I kept  still and pretending to sleep. Then I heard my door open. I kept my eyes  closed. I felt something moving around my bed, probably checking for  limbs.

Once it checked, everything was silent. I could sense it staring  at me. I didn't even move. Soon i heard my door shut. I was about to  open my eyes when I remembered that it like to trick you. After another  minute I heard my door open and shut again. I heard a knock on another  door so I knew it was safe.

I slowly opened my eyes and peeked at the door. I carefully looked around the room. It was safe. I fell back  asleep after a few minutes.

A while later I woke up to whispering. I  remembered rule 6 and kept my eyes closed. I wanted to see what was so  bad though so I quickly opened one eye slightly. I immediately closed it again once I saw what was there.

It was horrifying.

It was a girl but  she had long, thin limbs and a long, thin body. Her skin was wrinkly and  black. her limbs where bent in un-natural ways. She didn't seem to have  a face and had long, wet, black hair. The ends of her hair was blood  red. She was on the ceiling right above me.

Despite not having a face, I  think she saw me peek at her. "I sAw yoU" It said with a cursed voice,  switching between high and low pitched.

I lied so still, I barely even breathed. I heard it mumble and then everything was silent.

I opened my  eye ever so slightly and saw nothing. The cost was clear but I wasn't risking opening my eyes. I fell asleep soon after.

The  next morning I woke up to the cat sitting next to my bed. I noticed he was bigger than usual.

I knew what to do and ran into the owner's  bedroom and locked the door. After 5 minutes I came out. The cat was  back to normal size. I fed it breakfast and went to play games on my phone.

Then there was a knock on the door. "Hey I'm back home! Open the  door please! Or I wIlL uSe FoRcE..." The last part sounded demonic, like  the thing at the front door yesterday.

I didn't answer. 'The second  it's gone, I'm outta here' I thought. Soon it left.

Then I crept to the door and looked through the peep-hole. Nothing. I got my things, unlocked the door, and opened it. It seemed safe. I shut the door,  locked it, put the spare key back, and got in my car.

That's when I saw it, a creepy figure running towards my car. I floored it and broke every law and speed limit until I was around lots of people.

I slowed down a  bit but knew I wasn't safe until I got home. Once I got on an empty road  again, I sped home. I knew something was following.

Once I got on the final road to my house, I felt safe. I looked in the rear-view mirror  just in time to see the figure disappear behind a bush. I pulled into my  driveway and ran inside with all my things. I made sure all the doors  and windows where locked.

I am never pet-sitting again

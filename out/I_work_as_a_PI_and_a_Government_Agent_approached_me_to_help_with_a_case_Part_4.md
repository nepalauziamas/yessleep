It blinked as it judged us. Then it moved and the other eye took its place. The face behind the tunnel was so massive both eyes could not fit behind the entrance at the same time. That didn’t make any sense. Beside, the tunnel was filled in with bricks and Earth. This thing, whatever it was, simply could not be inside the tunnel based on the massive scale of the few features I did see.

“What do we have here? An odd pair to be sure.” The voice was low and booming. I smelled putrid breath as it spoke and I forced myself not to react. “An unfinished stone and a human. Not just a human. One that is also unfinished. A human that can never fully be a…”

I felt rage replace my fear of this creature. It took one look at me and saw something I desperately tried to hide and refused to talk about unless absolutely necessary. I was ready to try and kill this thing with my bare hands but Nick stopped the both of us. Without his face changing he grabbed the back of my shirt to drag me back when I wasn’t even aware I had taken a step forward, ready for a fight.

“Don’t listen to it. It’s only trying to get you worked up. It's in their nature.” He said, but it didn’t help me calm down.

“What he said, half rock, and half human. They’re only words.” The creature spoke with a cruel laugh afterwards.

“Nick, can I borrow your sword?” I asked loud enough for the tunnel beast to hear.

Nick’s sword wasn’t visible but I knew it was there. He wouldn’t go on a case trying to find a monster unharmed.

“Skyler, please don’t kill the Bridge Troll.” Nick replied in such a matter of fact tone it snapped me from my fighting mood.

I looked from him to the dark tunnel with only the one eye staring back. This massive thing was a Troll? It was under a bridge so that was understandable. I crossed my arms, not happy about not being able to do anything, but I let Nick speak.

“We are looking for the one killing homeless men in this city. One of which may have been taken from this park. I was hoping you saw something.” Nick said and gestured towards the bag containing the other jar of eggs in my hand.

“I may have. But who cares. They’re just trash. Not worth the time. At least their death provided some creature some fun.”

I felt my neck get hot and wanted to smash the jar of eggs. I didn’t know if this thing was just saying things to piss us off or if he really thought like this. If my sister didn’t take me in after my parents kicked me out, I might have ended up as these men only much worse. We both worked ourselves down to the bone to pay rent and have enough to eat. We got lucky. The men that were killed could be on the streets for all sorts of reasons they couldn’t control. I was not going to stand and listen to this thing insult eight people who died through no fault of their own.

Nick was also offended. Because of his lack of expression I didn’t know it until he drew his sword, the delicate thing making a musical sound as it appeared. Holding it out, he stared at the tunnel with his eyes blank and hand steady.

“If that’s the truth, then the same goes for yourself. If those men are trash only worth entertainment in death, then a Troll no one cares for can provide the same.”

We all fell silent. I could feel the air press in around my shoulders and it suddenly felt hotter than before. It was impossible to read Nick’s intentions. I honestly thought he was going to go through with killing it until he placed his sword back into the hilt and it faded from sight.

“I brought you eggs in exchange for information. I am looking for the killer of these men. They are not trash. They’re people. You're a Troll with a terrible personality but I can still respect you enough to make a basic exchange.”

I felt some tension fade at his words. At least those two weren’t going to get into a fight. I wasn’t expecting the Troll to be touched by his words, but rather only thankful he was still alive. When it spoke again the tone of voice was softer.

“I have nothing better to do all day but watch the ones in the park. It's like bird watching for humans. I saw a man get forced inside a white van and not return. I am unaware if he is one of your victims, but it is the only strange event I’ve seen with these homeless humans. Some just stop showing up for unknown reasons.” The Troll admitted.

I wasn’t expecting actual useful information from this creature. This didn’t fully answer our question but it did open up our investigation to other ideas. Was someone kidnapping men to feed to a pet monster? Or was there a human looking beast out there driving around picking up victims no one would miss? My train of thought was derailed when the Troll spoke again. Eye squinted as if it was smiling.

“I spotted this van for a few nights in a row before it took the man. I’ve seen it again, so maybe, it may strike again soon. Give me the other jar and I’ll tell you what took these men.”

I looked over to Nick, heart beating. Even after everything I wanted to trust this monster. Then again, with the Troll’s track record I wasn’t sure if it was telling the truth or just messing with us. Nick took the bag and walked over to set the jar of eggs within reach. Thankfully the Troll wasn’t just trying to lure Nick in to attack him. The eye disappeared and the fingernail took the jar. We waited and was positive the creature left before the voice came faintly as if from a distance.

“The one who took them is the most frightening monster on this planet. One not bound by rules and the one that has done the most amount of destruction throughout the ages.”

The voice was echoing through the tunnel as the lights started to flicker back on. We both stared down into the now empty tunnel wondering about the parting words of the Troll. I didn’t understand what kind of creature it was talking about so I looked over to Nick.

“Do you know what it meant?” I asked.

“I have no idea.” He said without a hint of shame.

In the end, we needed to camp out and watch the park all night. At least we knew we could be in the right area. If the Troll wasn’t lying to us, the white van could come prowling down the road looking for a new target. We sat on a park bench watching the street. Nick was flipping through his notebooks looking for any sort of clue on what monster we could be facing. Beside ourselves, two men camped out huddled in piles of dirty blankets a bit of a way away but within eyesight. We could watch them and the road at the same time. The night was cool because it was still spring. I should have brought a jacket.

After a while Nick gave up looking for any hints hidden in his notebook. He had a hint of frustration on his face.

“I must apologize for my overreaction earlier.” Nick said making me raise an eyebrow.

“That was an overreaction?”

I gave him a smile not knowing if he could tell I was teasing him. The dark park made me feel uneasy. An unknown threat was out there and might not take our meddling lightly. Every time I went on a case with Nick, I was risking my life. Overall, I felt as if it was worth it. I would never reach my goals working the normal jobs that came along. Yawning, I was a little surprised I could be tired and nervous at the same time. Looking back on the day, I realized I really didn’t help out in this case at all. I slouched down on the park bench feeling the same sense of frustration start up in my stomach. Nick noticed my mood but didn’t look as if he knew how to ask about what was wrong.

“I don’t feel helpful.” I said. “What happened to your old partner? Did they get a transfer or something?”

Honestly. Nick hadn’t told me much. I really hit the ground running accepting that things lurked in the night. I didn’t have a lot of information and figured it was because all of this was secret government stuff.

“She died.”

I sat up at his answer. His voice didn’t change but I sensed a shift in his mood. Nick wasn’t looking in my direction, or rather, he couldn’t bring himself to. Remembering his pink cellphone with all the charms I felt my arms prickle. It was a phone that should belong to a girl. A memento from his last partner. How recent did this happen? I didn’t feel right to ask.

“I'm sorry.” I said in an awkward tone.

He didn’t react. Just kept staring forwards. Not only was I not helping and just there for a payout, I brought up something uncomfortable. Just as I started feeling awful about sitting next to the agent, he rescued the conversation.

“I’m glad you’re here. I do not wish to be alone so soon after what happened. All the other partner options are.... Not ideal. Most would just use me for what I am instead of trying to strike up a conversation. I am not experienced in dealing with others so I feel as if I may make things difficult for you.” Nick said as he finally looked over.

“It’s scary how nice you are.”

Confusion fluttered over his face but he accepted my answer. I wanted to know what Nick was. The Troll called him an unfinished stone. It really didn’t feel as if I could ask him about it after he mentioned how others would use him for simply being whatever he was. In the future I would find the right time to sneak the question in. Because I was looking in his direction, I noticed some movement over his shoulder. On reflex I grabbed him and pulled Nick off the bench just as a clawed hand darted out from the bush behind the wooden bench.

Out from the darkness sprang a lanky hissing creature. The body long and deformed. Milky white eyes glared at us as its mouth opened nearly ear to ear. The skin was a sickly grey and I could see the creature’s ribs. One swat of those claws could easily cut us in half.

“What the hell is that?!” I shouted, startled at the sudden appearance.

“A minor creature. Not much of a threat.” Nick replied with his hand hovering at his waist.

I waited for one of us to break the stalemate. With his sword, Nick could easily take out this thing. However, he was hesitating. The problem was his sword was too powerful. It would dig into the ground and create all sorts of damage wherever he directed his attack. We didn’t know if anyone else was camping out in the small area of trees, since earlier today we were told people often did so instead of sleeping out in the open. One swing of the sword would kill this monster but also anyone else unlucky enough to be in its way.

The creature acted first. It launched itself off the park bench towards Nick’s face with claws out. I was terrified but still moved. I slammed my shoulder into this creature knocking it off course and to the ground. I felt bones crack against my shoulder. It scrambled on the ground making yowling sounds trying to get back into position to attack again. It arched its back on all fours ready to bite our faces off, when movement from Nick made it pause.

Out from a suit pocket he pulled out a bag of beef jerky. I stared at him, mouth slightly open. He was appeasing a twisted creature made of nightmares with a snack. Tossing it in front of us, the thing darted over taking the bag in its wide mouth. Without taking its eyes off of us it backed up under the bench. Somehow, the thing sank into the dark shadow of the bench leaving us alone.

“What the fuck...” I whispered mostly to myself.

“I believe the Troll sent this creature after us as amusement. It may be watching right now having a laugh. The thing that attacked us is part of a race that hates agents almost as much as it likes snacks.”

Nick let his hands drop now that the threat passed. I looked over my shoulder towards the tunnel. The lights were still on but I believed the Troll was watching and hoped that it was disappointed in the outcome. After I heard tires screeching, I knew the Troll had won in the end. It distracted us from our job. I cursed again and started off as fast as my legs would carry me towards the road.

The two homeless men were still sleeping and somehow not woken up by the brief fight. If the tires belonged to the white van we wanted to find out if it could have taken someone else we didn’t see before. I ran right into the middle of the empty street looking around, trying to see what car made the noise. My heart sank when I spotted the back of a white van peeling off down the straight road. We didn’t have any means of going after it.

Turns out we didn’t need to go after it. Nick ran so fast he was unable to stop in the middle of the street. He skidded to a stop and needed to double back to where I stood. If the situation wasn’t so dire, the sight would have been comical. Again, his hand went to his waist and this time he drew his sword.

In one lightning-fast movement, he drew the blade and sent a thin shock wave of destruction down the street towards the van. A burst of wind blasted my face and I needed to raise my hands so I didn’t see the impact but I heard it. A terrible crashing sound came from down the street. It was so loud it hurt my ears even from a distance. When I lowered my hands, my jaw dropped.

Nick had cut the van in half, each side falling away from each other. One crashed into a parked car, the other went forward a few more feet just to slam into a telephone pole. The side that hit the parked car tipped over on its side revealing the inside of the van, where a man dressed in rags lay limp. He was tied down to the van wall ensuring he was the only one that was safe from the crash.

I ran behind Nick, who kept running to go check on the driver. Along the road was debris scattered from the now split van. At first, I assumed they were tools. I was so concerned on getting the man from the destroyed van I didn't focus on them. When I knew he was knocked out and not dead, I started to look around unsure of what I was seeing.

Saws, hammers, drills, bear traps, and more littered the road. Along the walls were more of the dangerous looking objects. I finally clued into what I was seeing after I spotted the stains on some of the tools. The van was a place of torture. All of these instruments were chosen to inflict harm on a human. I thought back to the bodies of the eight men and everything made sense. We were never looking for a supernatural creature.

I was careful as I got the man untied and got him onto the road. Nick pulled the driver from the front of the crushed van, face bloody and nose broken. He might have been saved by the airbag. Sirens started to come closer as dogs barked around us. The crash attracted a lot of attention and I wasn’t sure I knew how to explain it to the police.

“The driver is alive. I am not certain if he’ll make it through.”

Getting down on our level, Nick took off his jacket to let the man we rescued use it as a pillow until an ambulance arrived. I looked around still unable to believe this entire time we were looking for a serial killer. The state of the bodies looked beyond anything a human could do. I now know that was foolish. Back then in my mind, crimes like this only happened in the podcasts I listened to while staking out a cheating husband. It never felt real and being suddenly forced to face the horrors of my own kind made me feel in a way I couldn’t describe.

“How are we going to explain all of this?” I asked and looked around at the sudden chaos.

The same blank expression on his face was my response. Just as flashing lights started to color the street, Nick shrugged.

“I have no idea.”

That did not make me feel better in the slightest.

I was grilled for hours over what happened. They separated us. I was smart enough to not say a word no matter how stressed I felt. After six hours a female lawyer came into the room. She simply gave the detective a sheet of paper. Then I was free to go. I send Nick a text the moment I got my phone back. His response was ‘I’ll talk to you later.’

I waited for two more days until he sent me a message asking if I could meet him in the park near my office. I wasn’t busy so I went, wanting to know the outcome of our case. He looked terrible as if he hadn’t slept since the last time we saw each other. He still gave me a wave when I walked over to sit on the bench beside him. He explained The Corporation cleaned up the mess making it look like a regular accident. The man who was driving was in fact the killer. Because he used different tools and even some jaws of dead animals, the bodies looked as if they were torn apart by something not human. Nick fiddled with his phone and a few seconds later mine pinged. A payment of a thousand dollars was deposited in my account. I honestly forgot about money because of everything that happened.

“This is all that was left over from doing a big coverup. I’m sorry it’s barely anything. Because the case had a human culprit my job didn’t want to pay anything. I put my foot down on that saying you should get something for your time.”

I stared at my phone knowing this was pretty good for a single day of working. Nick was acting as if that amount was chump change though. He did mention bigger cases paid out more but I had no clue just how much more that was.

“Nick, you know a thousand dollars is a pretty decent amount of money, right? Some people don’t even earn that in a week.”

He stared at me, that blank expression saying something I didn’t want to read into. This dang bastard was probably richer than I would ever be in my life because he wasn’t human and could fight monsters for a massive profit all the while being unaware of that fact. If he wasn’t so nice I would be upset.

His phone rang. He answered it in a language I'd never heard before. Soon he hung up and apologized, saying he needed to leave for work again.

 “Call me anytime you have a job you think I can handle. I might be useful for something someday.”

I let out a chuckle and I thought I spotted a hint of a smile on his face. He promised if anything came up he would send me a message. Soon I was left alone in the park on a beautiful sunny day but unable to really appreciate the weather. I kept staring down at the new payment feeling a dark pit in my stomach.

The images of those eight men came flashing into my mind. Thanks to Nick they got their names back. And because he cared, there would be no more victims from their killer. I knew it wasn’t enough. Things like this could keep happening. Yet again I felt useless.

I searched for the website of the shelter where we asked for names a few days ago. Finding the right page, I could easily donate my one day of work to the shelter. I knew it really didn’t solve the overall problem, but at least it might help a few people for a little while. I stared at the charity receipt email telling myself the reason for the donation was for tax deductions at the end of the year. I placed my phone back into my pocket to get ready to head back to my little office. I needed to learn more about supernatural creatures and become a better contract worker for the bigger jobs. After I make sure my sister was set, I had some other ideas for the funds I would be risking my life for. It might not do much overall, but as Nick has said, efforts are never really wasted.

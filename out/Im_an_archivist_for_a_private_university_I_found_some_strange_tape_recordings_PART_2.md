[[PART 1]](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/x2tn6o/im_an_archivist_for_a_private_university_i_found/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

Hello again, it's Naissance. Weird name, I know.

First of all, I want to thank everyone for the traction I had gotten in the last post. I’m new to websites like this, and it’s nice to see that people are invested in learning more about these tapes. I read some suggestions, and decided to also physically copy the transcripts down on paper in case anything happens to the digital records. Seeing as the last post is still up and running, I hope this won’t be necessary to fall back on though. I tried using the copier to print out the transcripts, but it always came out distorted and illegible. Weird. I'm gonna have someone from the university take a look at it later on. I guess I gotta stick with copying them down by hand for now.

I realize I've been poor in my description of the back shelf, and archive room, thus far. The archives are down a flight of stairs in the main administrative building of the university, which itself is hard to find through a maze of identical hallways and doors. It’s rather off the beaten path, which is probably why there isn’t a lot of foot traffic here. The archive itself is full of steel shelves that line the rectangular room in orderly rows as well as the back wall. It’s all very… ordinary. Or it would be, if not for an old, decrepit, wooden shelf near the back corner wall. This was the ‘back shelf’. The shelf seemed to be older than the room itself, with artifacts and documents on it much older than that. I can only imagine it wasn’t changed due to fear of damaging its contents. I have to utilize the utmost caution when interacting with them. 

That being said, the rest of the archives was full of mundane administrative and historical documents related to the functions of the university itself. Miscellaneous old records from the local government were also given to the university to watch over. Were it not for that shelf, the place would lose a lot of intrigue. That’s where the oldest relics in the archives were. That’s where the tapes were.

There were seven I found, in total. Each neatly numbered in a sequence from 1A to 4B. Varying dates. In fact, the sequence seems to not be chronological at all. It makes me wonder what it means, and what the connection between these tapes are at all. It felt like what I was doing was dangerous. Like I’ve invited some eldritch, malicious force into this world. It's starting to get me a little scared if I’m being honest; like I’m in freefall through a dark abyss, and I have no idea when I’m going to reach the bottom.

I really think I’ve been stuck in this dusty room for too long. I think being here all day is starting to get to me. Despite being a larger space, it does feel claustrophobic at times. And it always feels like that back shelf is pushing me to explore it even further. Although I was fascinated at first, It's a feeling I’m starting to dread. 

I’ve made some progress on rewriting the transcripts on some of the tapes, and I just finished another one today. I’m probably just misremembering, but I swear it was slightly different when I listened to them the first time. I had this weird feeling when I was transcribing it, like the tape itself knew what I was doing. This one was much worse than the first. And there were these disturbing distortions… 

I think I’ll need some time to myself after this one. I hope everyone understands. Here it is.

**\[START\]**

\[CLICK\]

STEVENS: Expedition Log #2. I’m Jeffrey Stevens, here with good friend Tom Ford and my wife Clara. This is our second exploration of a massive unexplored cave system in the Rockies of northern Idaho, and we’ll be attempting to survey a southwestern lead we saw during our last expedition. I’ll be working point, Clara will be sketching, and Tom is on instruments. Say hi guys.

CLARA: Hi!

TOM: Hello!

\[SHUFFLING, HEAVY EQUIPMENT DROPS\]

STEVENS: Right now, we're in a large chamber near the mouth of a cave system we're naming the Sheer Strait. This is our last equipment check at the forward base before we head down a southwest lead passage Radio check?

\[RADIO CLICKS ON\]

TOM: Gamma this is Arrowhead Survey Team, do you copy?

GAMMA: *Loud and clear Arrowhead. VLF radio operational. Walkies one and three?*

\[TWO RADIOS CLICK ON\]

STEVENS: All good Gamma, thanks. Starting descent in approximately five minutes. 

GAMMA: *Copy that.*

CLARA: Looks like everything is good outside. Let’s pack up. 

\[SHUFFLING, BAGS ZIP, EQUIPMENT RATTLES\]

STEVENS: Equipment?

TOM: All good here. 

STEVENS: Alright, let’s head out. 

\[FOOTSTEPS ECHO, EQUIPMENT RATTLES\]

STEVENS: Here’s the entryway.

\[PAUSE\]

TOM: 24.2° decline from the entrance. Door about 1 x 1.9 meters, and the passage continues at…  256° SW. 

CLARA: Got it.

\[MARKER SQUEAKS\]

TOM: I'm gonna finish a few measurements. Go on ahead.

STEVENS: Alright, let’s head through Clara. Watch your head, there’s some pretty sharp-looking rocks on the ceiling. 

\[RADIO CLICKS\]

STEVENS: Gamma, starting descent.

GAMMA: *Roger that. Stay safe down there Arrowhead.*

\[FOOTSTEPS ON GRAVEL\]

CLARA: Floor is uneven, watch your step. Don’t want to slide into a hole.

STEVENS: That was *one* time. 

CLARA: Hopefully your last. 

STEVENS: I think I’ve got a few more in me, personally. 

CLARA: *Personally*, I don’t want to spend a few hours rescuing your ass again.

STEVENS: Fair enough.

\[HEAVY COUGHING\]

CLARA: God, it smells rotten this way. What is that?

STEVENS: Something probably just crawled in here and died. A surprising amount of life in these caves. Not unheard of. But fuck, it’s really strong. It must be close. 

CLARA: Just our luck. 

STEVENS: Here, the passage dips again. 

\[RADIO CLICKS\]

STEVENS: Tom, if you’re finished with the measurements you can come on over. 

TOM: *Roger that. Jesus Stevens, did you take a shit over here? It smells.* 

STEVENS: Next time it’ll be on your face, asshole. 

TOM: *Very funny. Did something die?*

STEVENS: We’ll probably come across it further ahead. Just hurry up and get over he*—*

\[PAUSE\]

\[LOUD STATIC\]

DISTORTED VOICE: ***NON FLUIT HIC. EST ENIM INFINITUM.*** 

\[BUZZING\]

\[PAUSE\]

TOM: —a sheer cliff, we’ve gotta rappel down. I’ll set up the rigs. 

\[BAGS UNZIP, SHUFFLING\]

CLARA: It's so deep you can't see the bottom... I'm gonna toss a glowstick. 

\[GLOWSTICK WHIRRS\]

\[PAUSE\]

\[FAINT SPLASH\]

STEVENS: I can't see it. Did it hit water or something? Might be trouble if we need diving equipment to go further. Can we get distance?

TOM: It’s out of range; couldn’t be less than 100 meters. 

\[RADIO CLICKS\]

STEVENS: Gamma, team came upon a drop. Might be a sump, we'll need to come back and get diving equipment after we check it out. 

GAMMA: \[STATIC\]

STEVENS: Gamma? Do you copy?

GAMMA: \[STATIC\]

TOM: That’s weird. We aren’t that far from the entrance. 

STEVENS: Not too weird. Might just be something in the rocks throwing off the signal.

CLARA: Should we go back then?

STEVENS: No, no. It’s alright. Our radios should still communicate with each other as long as we are in eyesight. I’ll just rappel down to get an idea of what we are dealing with, and we can rendezvous back at the forward base.

\[RETCHING, COUGHING\]

CLARA: Ugh, fuck! There’s that smell again. It’s definitely coming from down there. 

TOM: Aw, hell. I sure am glad I don’t have to get closer to that shit. 

STEVENS: Whatever died must’ve fallen off this cliff into the water. It’s fine, I can handle it. I’ll make it quick. Just stay on the radio. 

TOM: Alright, let’s set you up then*—*

\[PAUSE\]

\[LOUD STATIC\]

DISTORTED VOICE: ***SANGUIS MANET. SANGUIS MANET. SANGUIS MANET.***

STEVENS: *—*fuck! It’s fucking everywhere, jesus christ. My god. How were their bodies… bent like that? Christ. 

CLARA: *Jeffrey! Are you there? Are you alright? What happened?*

STEVENS: There’s fucking blood everywhere, Clara. It’s all over the walls. So much blood*—* what did this? T-there’s two bodies*—* no, three? I can’t tell. There’s a couple arms I see… This is fucked up. These people didn’t fall. Ripped apart… guts everywhere. Torsos missing legs. The blood is pooling at the bottom of this pit… There's so much... 

TOM: *Bodies? You found bodies? Jesus Stevens, that’s horrible. — ve gotta get — ck up here. We —  to repo—* 

\[PAUSE\]

STEVENS: This blood is*—*  this blood is fucking warm. I*—*  this couldn’t have happened more than a couple hours ago*—* these bodies are *fresh*. And it doesn’t smell like rot anymore*—* what happened here?

It was difficult to listen to this one. When I first transcribed it, I was still under the assumption that most of these were student projects, or fake. Now doubtful of that, I can’t help but feel horrified when I think of those dark caverns. When I think of that creature— Stevens, he was about to say *face*, wasn’t he? It had Clara’s face. Why would it have her face? I hoped to god that this creature was a hoax. I hoped that my initial assumption was correct. But as I go back through these tapes, the less plausible that conclusion is to me. 

I don’t know whether or not this tape and ‘Decline’ are closely related or not. I think this creature and the one in ‘Decline’ may be the same, but there’s no way to know for sure just going off of audio. I wanted to do a little bit of research on the two supposed survivors, though. Tom Ford and Clara Stevens. Ford unfortunately passed a few years ago of unrelated health complications. It was hard to track down Clara, and it took making a few of the right calls to communities living near the Sheer Strait to get a lead. She lives in California. I got her number, and I’m going to drive down to interview her sometime next month. I want to know her retelling of these events. 

I feel like I’m getting more and more affected by these tapes the more I listen to them. I’ll admit that I haven’t been completely transparent about how this has influenced my mental state. While working on ‘Arrowhead’, I smelt something rancid. Lifting my head from my laptop, I saw broken limbs covered in blood crawling out of the back shelf; An amalgamation of horrifically twisted arms and legs that pulled itself out to invade our mundane realm— to escape the confines of the tapes. I blinked, and it was gone. The hallucination thoroughly terrified me. I chose to go home early that day to rest.

And that strange voice, in the tapes. I feel like I’ve heard it. Or at least, I’ve imagined it since finishing this transcript. I imagine the bodies, sometimes, too. In the hall. Near the back shelf. Even at home. I wonder what they looked like in life. I wondered whether or not they felt meaningful and fulfilled before their unfortunate fate. Most of all, I imagine the pain they felt when they were torn apart, reduced to scattered viscera. I imagine their blood on the walls, pooling in a deep abyss for all of eternity. 

*Sanguis Manet.* 

The blood remains.

Part 2.

Liam sniggered, 'look at this!'.

There was a pile of dead birds lying in various states of decomposition by the window.

'That's rancid man' Brian said covering his nose and mouth.

I stood a few steps behind, shaking, the light from my torch was visibly vibrating on the wall, nobody noticed but I was terrified.

Brian and Liam were talking, I couldn't focus.

I felt myself being drawn to the room across the hall, like my very soul was being slowly pulled by some unknown force.

Time seemed to slow to almost a complete halt and voices echoed around my head.

'Danny' a voice came from the abyss forming before my eyes.

'Danny?' Everything returned to normal in a flash as I saw Brian and Liam staring at me confused, I felt faint.

'Danny, you okay?' Brian said as he began to approach me.

'I-I... I'm fine, I just felt a bit dizzy' I said, feeling like my legs were about to give way, 'I'll be okay, just let's get this over with'.

Liam sniggered at Brian and patted his back as if to say, 'what's his problem?'

I took no notice and left the room. 

The others followed behind into the hallways where we stayed for a few short minutes.

'Let's try that other room then' Brian broke the silence, 'the one we thought Liam was in earlier, we should at least look in since you thought someone was in there' he continued nodding in my direction.

He began walking with Liam in tow towards the room opposite, I hesitantly followed, I didn't want to go but I didn't want to be by myself.

They tried the handle and tried barging the door but it would not yield.

'It must be barricaded shut somehow, there's no lock!' Liam said looking the door up and down. 
'Let's just head upstairs'.

I stared at the door knowing full well it was opening itself earlier, I saw it shut with my own eyes, Brian saw it opening too but he just wasn't acknowledging the fact that this didn't make any sense, he turned and followed Liam like an obedient puppy to the stairway without saying a word.

I was hot on their heels as we began to climb the old stairs. 

Piece of concrete from the stairs were crumbling and falling on the floor below with every step.

We made it to the third floor, 2 rooms on this landing, both without doors, it smelled like shit up here, although the whole place smelled like shit to be honest.

Immediately a scraping sound could be heard from the room on the left, like metal on stone.

I pulled the hammer from the bag and held it out in front of me, ready for whatever may come at us.

Liam chuckled, 'put that away Danny, you couldn't swing it if you wanted to' he glanced at Brian for approval but Brian's eyes were fixed on the blackened doorway.

A slow continuous rhythmic clicking sound began coming from the dark room, our torches weren't powerful enough to illuminate the inside, they seemed to be reaching the doorway then losing all light to the darkness beyond.

Liam didn't seem phased, I couldn't tell if he was hearing the same things as us.

'So... we just standing here then!?' Liam asked sarcastically, 'what's up with you two?'

'You hear that Brian' I murmured, ignoring Liam completely.

Brian nodded, eyes wide and trained on the doorway.

Liam scoffed, 'very good, well I'm going to look in here, if you're both too scared then wait out here'.

Liam walked toward the door, getting slower as he got closer, I could tell his brave streak was quickly dissipating, he did continue through though, albeit cautiously.

Liam disappeared into the darkness, Brian looked at me and tilted his head toward the door 'come on, we can't leave him, we need to go in man'.

Brian started toward the darkness, the light from his torch disappearing unnaturally the same away Liam's did as he crossed the threshold.

I let out a huge sigh and began walking forward, the ominous clicks still reverberating in my ears.

I entered the black room, the torch wasn't much use, I could only see a couple of feet in front of me.

The room felt huge, I crept around for ages without finding a wall, the doorway acting like a safety beacon seemed to be getting smaller as I continued on.

'Fuck, fuck off!' Brian yelped as I bumped into him.

'Sorry I didn't see you' I said placing a hand on his shoulder, 'where the hell is he?'

'No idea, I can't see jack shit in here!' Brian replied sounding agitated.

The room appeared to be filled with a thick black fog that impaired our vision and also our ability to see very far using the torch

The clicks seemed to get louder, I really didn't want to follow them but it was the only source of anything in this room, we had to at least find a wall.

I startled myself as I bumped into the stone wall, it felt cold and wet, almost slimy.

'Found a wall, just follow it' I said, with my hand still on Brian's shoulder I guided him along the wall, torches in front of us the whole time.

The torches struggled to cut through the darkness but only a few feet away I could begin to make out that we were approaching a corner.

Adrenaline pumped through my veins and my skin turned to ice as I also noticed there was a dark figure standing in the corner.

'L-Liam?' I stammered, inching closer praying this was just another joke.

We were close enough now I could make out the clothes and hair, it was him but what the hell was he doing.

'Liam stop it, we've found you, ha ha ha great joke, stop being a dick'.

The figure turned to face us, I could just about make out the white eyes and an expressionless face, it was Liam but, he seemed really off.

The light completely died on mine and Brian's torches, we were immediately plunged into the deepest black you can ever imagine.

We were frozen in fear, the room was dead silent.

You could literally hear a pin drop.

Then from the corner in front, a scraping sound, and some scratching noises inching closer to us, I looked back at our safety beacon, the doorway, and saw someone standing in the doorway too.

We had no way out, the scraping and scratching got slowly closer and a deep menacing laugh was barely audible but definitely there, then a low gargling sound that sounded like it was from a distance.

We started inching back to avoid Liam's creeping advance, even though we couldn't see anything, I'm sure I could feel his breath on my face.

'What you two playing at? Let's head upstairs quickly' Liam shouted from about 15 feet away, I tuned to the doorway and saw him standing there looking like his perfectly normal, annoying bastard self.

We sprinted to the door, bit not before Liam bolted up the stairs to the fourth floor, laughing like a lunatic.

Brian and I stopped in the hallway to catch our breath.

'What was that, what's he up to? With his stupid jokes!' I said to Brian who was looking up the stairwell. 'Hiding in the corner like a weirdo' I continued after a few breaths.

'Was it him in the corner though?' Brian said, seeming unsure of himself.

'Well, I seen him... so, yes it was him, then when the lights went out he must have ran round to the door, he's trying to scare us again, it's not happening!' I felt pissed off at Liam's stupid games. 

There seemed to be a bit role reversal, Brian appeared terrified whereas I felt like I had to suck it up, take the lead here and put a stop to this, I felt proud of myself for not being scared.

Then Brian had to ruin it.

'But how would he know that the torches would stop working, 2 torches at the exact same time!?'
'And how could he know we would find him in there, that room was insanely dark, the time it took him to somehow get past us in pitch blackness and get to the door to then run upstairs was about 3 seconds, he done that without a sound when you can't even see your hand in front of your face?' Brian's voice began trembling.

I started to question myself, I could feel the fear building in me once more.

I turned to the room, the clicking had stopped but there were scraping sounds now and again, I turned back to Brian, 'so you think that wasn't Liam in there?' My voice trembled.

He looked up the stairs.

'Either that or... that wasn't Liam who ran up the stairs' Brian looked back at me, dead in the eyes. 

'But we both saw him, it was him' I felt like I was pleading for an answer, for some sanity.

'You saw him in there too, what did you see, as it definitely him? Could it have been the shadows of something else?' Brian took a few steps toward the door, stopping just in front. 'Liam!!' He gave a quick shout.

'It was him, it was definitely him but he... he looked weird, I couldn't make out the full face perfectly but it know it was him' I was beginning to struggle with my senses. 'But then, we both saw him at the door and it was definitely him being himself, being a dick, I don't know anymore maybe my brain was tricking me' I had to sit on the floor for a second and collect my thoughts.

'So we can both basically confirm that we are sure Liam ran up the stairs, then I think we should go up there and get him, and just get out of here' Brian turned and headed for the stairs.

'Let me get up, 2 seconds' I got myself to my feet and met him at the bottom of the stairs, they went up and left and up again, we could see up to the next landing, it looked the came as that room.

'Get the candles' Brian said.

We pulled 2 candles and a lighter from the backpack and lit them, they didn't do much but it was something.

'Rock paper scissors for white goes first, best of three' I suggested.

'No we don't have time to fuck around, I'll just go first'

Thankfully Brian's brave streak had returned.

We crept up the stairs, listening for any sounds. 

Apart from rubble and junk crunching under our feet, the whole place was relatively quiet.

The air felt thicker up here as we approached the last few steps, a dagger like chill pierced my skin, it was unnaturally cold.

'Liam come out, we're going home' Brian called from the top step, holding the candle out.

I joined him at the top and held my candle out in an attempt to light the area up a bit.

'Come and look at this' Liam's voice echoed from the other end of the hall.

'No, we want to go, just come out we're not leaving you' Brian replied.

'Just quickly, you need to see this... then we can go' Liam called over again.

Brian and I looked at each other, I shook my head, 'No'.

'No, Liam, just hurry up man we want to go' Brian shouted.

'Well... I don't want to go home'. Liam's voice sounded closer. 

I didn't see anything, but I heard the sharp exhale and something blew both of our candles out. 

At the same time and ear shattering clatter or metal from way below rung out, like someone emptying a bag of spanners onto the road.

We were both absolutely dumbfounded.

'What the fucking hell was that?' Brian was visibly trembling in his boots.

It hit me like a tonne of bricks 'the ladder!!!' I said as we both began to scramble back down the stairs.

My worst fear was confirmed when we reached the steps leading down to the first floor, the ladder been literally thrown across to the other side of the landing.

The Halloween clown decoration was standing in its place.

Its eyes lit up and its mechanical arms and head began to move.

'Welcome to hell children' the clown screeched.

Dear God, I wish I could make this up. I know it’s gonna sound strange.

I was hooked on meth and robbed a gas station so I could feed my habit. I still have every memory of it. 

I walked into the store and a young fellow who was in college greeted me. I held up a pistol and told him to empty the register. I was so close to pulling the trigger but I didn’t. Cops got called after I hightailed out and they found me shorty after. 

I did okay in prison, stayed out of trouble and fights . Seeing my mom bawl during my sentencing will forever haunt my memory. They quit having things to do with me after I pawned her ring and other things for drug money.

My cellmate was a really nice guy too and understood how I didn’t have any plans when I got out. He told me he had an uncle who owned a restaurant and would love to hire me too, it would be great money and have free lodging. 

I knew it would be my best bet considering most jobs around here that took felons in gave horrible pay or really rough labor. He got out a few weeks before me. 

The day I got out his uncle stood by the gate in front of a black Cadillac, he wore a black suit and was holding a cane with a silver wolfs head on it.

“Hello James, it’s a pleasure.” His hand felt so cold when I shook it.

“My name is Stan. My nephew has told me plenty about you and you deserve a second chance. Please sit in the back and I’ll fill you in on the details.”

I quietly sat in the car as he got in the passenger front. He lifted his hand and an old man in suit and worn scally cap began to turn the wheel and move. 

“We’re going another state off. We live in a little no named town with no crime or drugs. The kind of work you’ll be doing betters the community.”

He’s right, I do believe a good restaurant brings the community together. He reached back his cold hand holding a golden necklace.

“This is an amulet, James. It’s mandatory you wear it always. Never get caught without it. Let’s just say that the last man who forgot to wear it wasn’t around long.” The driver let out a quaint chuckle followed by a cough.

“This amulet provides you protection. None of our customers can harm you as long as you wear it.”

“It sounds like we’re feeding a bunch of monsters.”

“No James, you’ll find that people are truly the monsters. Some sit in court houses, others selling poison, and some that are truly malignant .”

The rest of the drive was quiet. About two hours passed and we pull up to this older brick building. The driver opened Stans door.

“Okay James, you’re room number is 6. You can have it for a while until you can afford an apartment. Before you go in there, I need to show you how this place works .”

We walked through the back door and it was full of people preparing food that I couldn’t see from where I was standing. 

“You’re job is simple. Deliver the food we sit on this table.” His voice was so monotoned yet dreary.

“Look through this window , don’t scream. If you scream, things get bad.”

I looked through the window and it took my breath.

I seen ghouls, ghosts, vampires, werewolves, monsters of all kind loading up plates and eating. Any kind of creature you could think of was there. Some looked like humans while some looked like pure evil.

“Remember, that amulet will protect you. Some may try to convince you to take it off but you better not.” He was pointing his pale finger at me.

“They come here and eat instead of going to the streets and ravaging towns and innocent people. We do good and honest work.”

I looked on the plates and seen the most vile things imaginable.

“Where does this food come from?” 

“It’s better you not ask.”

“I uh, I think I’m gonna be sick.”

“Most people do at first but you’ll get used to it. When you’re done I’m going to need you to carry about that tray of eyeballs .”

I carried the tray and did not dare look down. I felt so scared and these monsters began to stare at me. My body was shaking though I tried hard to keep my composure.

“Excuse me.” The voice sounded deep and graveled. “Excuse me.”

I turn around after setting the food down in the marked location. It was an ogre about seven feet tall looking at me.

“Tell them that we need more blood pudding.” 

I felt my knees buckling. “Uh…uh…yes sir.”

“Thank you.”

I walked back in the kitchen and told one of the guys. One of them looked back at me.

“Hey new guy, we need help in the basement.” His hand was making a rushing gesture. 

I walked in the basement and there was a young lady chained up . She began crying “please, I didn’t see anything. I’m supposed to get married next month.”

The guy looked at me. “We usually get homeless people but she was at the place at the wrong time.”

I froze.

“Come on new guy, this is heroic work. You don’t want them them to fire you or let monsters eat people in the street. We only do this once a month.”

I put my head down and nodded I’d help.

“Congratulations, you’ve passed the test. “ I turned around and stand walked in the room being led by his cane.

“Did I do good?” The girl had a huge smile on her face.

“Yes Lily. You did amazing. Take the rest of the day off.” She unshackled herself and walked out the door.

“You can take the rest of the day off too if you want to. Go ahead and check out your room. Up there is where you’ll find your rule list.”

All I could muster out was “where’s your nephew?”

“He died in a prison fight back in 99. But that doesn’t mean we don’t ever communicate. He only talks to the one he thinks deserves a better life, congratulations.”

I’m going to head up to my room,  I’ll update you guys as soon as I can.

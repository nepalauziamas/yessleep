Up until this day when my mom brings it up, i try and ignore it.. 
 
 As a kid I’ve always had the tendency to urinate myself in bed. This could’ve been from the fact that mom and dad had always shared their experiences with the paranormal ( probably to scare us into behaving) It could also of been from my brothers just scaring me into thinking there’s was something under the bed if I stepped down from it at night. It could have been the scary movies we’d watch without my mothers permission, she couldn’t blame us either, we would be left alone from 12pm - 3am throughout the week due to work. ultimately it could’ve just been me overthinking all of these things at once.
   
But something horrible happened to me one evening that might have something to do with me wetting the bed for almost all my childhood. Im talking about from 6 to almost 10 years old.( i know disgusting right)

One evening while playing with some toys I decided to step into my closet and set up in there. I always liked my own space while playing , I also never liked my brothers coming in and taking a toy I was about to play with, so I avoided them completely. My closet was small and had multiple shelves in it circling around it entirely . It was also full of stuffed animals, but what mostly took up the space was a ridiculous amount of Beanie Babies. 

I never payed much attention to them since my mom would get them as decorations occasionally. That day though, I had experienced fear like no other. 

While on the ground cris-crossed making my toys fight , I noticed movement above me. I looked up and nothing. Then continued playing , and again, movement. I stayed still and slowly looked up. There they we’re.. staring at me , staring directly into my eyes with the deepest and darkest eyes I’ve ever seen. I froze up. I couldn’t move, i couldn’t talk or scream. Then, they spoke. It wasn’t human voices. It was a deep and rough tone, almost as if their throats had been burnt. 
 “we should take him “ one said. “can you hear us”? As they all spoke at once all in sync.“ we just want to play with you ___(my name) “. 
 My face filled with dread , an unexplainable heat overwhelmed my whole body, followed by goosebumps. 
 
Then the unimaginable happened..
They all jumped on top of me all at once they started laughing . I snapped out of the trance I was in and made a run for it. I ran out the bedroom door and straight out the backyard door. I panted like dog without water and my heart pounded against my chest. I cried softly to myself and eventually my brother found me. 

I couldn’t explain it to anyone , nor would I attempt to for the next few months. How could I? Who was going to believe me? As the months went on I’d wet the bed consistently. Even when i wouldn’t notice I would wake up with a bed soaked in urine. Mom had gone through 3 beds by this time and eventually one day she asked me what was going on( for her it was normal for me to wet the bed but not this frequently). I could only remember what had happened that terrible evening. I built up the courage to tell her and with watery eyes and my body trembling I explained. 

She said I had nothing to worry about and that I was probably just imagining. 
 I swore on my life that what had happened was real. 
 
The beanie babies continued to stay in that closet for the next few months until mom decided it was time to donate them to goodwill. I was relieved of that.
Couple years pass by and my father had been talking to one of the neighbors right above us and what this neighbor said shook me up for life. 

He said that he had been hearing strange noises, dishes breaking , and most of all during the night he would hear deep voices out of the blue. When he asked the landlord about the history of the apartment, they told him that the couple before him had committed suicide in the closet.. 

Till this day my mom brings my story up as a joke but i remember it clear as day and yet no one believes me. 

Do you?

 

**I killed a man. A little over a year ago, I was leaving a party. A party where I may or may not have had too much to drink and ran him over on a late night jog.**

**I was scared shitless sitting behind the wheel of my truck knowing full well that the** ***thud*** **and** ***bumps*** **were not an animal. A animal could've left the streak of flesh and blood in my rearview mirror that seemed to stretch well past the boundaries of the crimson break lights, but an animal sure as hell wasn't making those pained and guttural noises that pierced the deathly silent overcast night.**

**Not a soul could've heard him but me, we were well outside the city limits, far from anywhere important.**

**It felt like forever before I could put it in park and step out of my truck. My nerves had gotten to me and the shakes had begun to subside as I slowly made my way to the source of the unnatural noises. The occasional** 

***ping***

***ping***

***ping***

**emanating behind me as my door was left ajar. By the time I rounded the rear of the truck, I could see the top half of a man protruding from the rear of the truck, his arms were mangled and outstretched, his face was bloodied and unrecognizable in the reddish glow of the trucks rear running lights.** 

**Bits of skin and flesh laid about in the growing pool. He was just as good as dead. If he wasn't already. He quit making noises and he didn't look like he was breathing as I reached down to pull him out from under the truck.**

**He left out a shrill scream as blood split from his mouth, covering my face in the bloody mucus.**

**I went to work the next day driving the old car I was trying to sell. The front end of my truck was slightly damaged when I took it to the car wash to clean the speckles and splatters of blood from the grille and undercarriage. I didn't want to take any chances of the damaged being questioned, so I left it nestled in my garage until I got it fixed a few days later. No one questioned it.**

**I neglected my work for a few days afterwards, running late to hearings, meetings, and responding late to emails and phone calls. If it wasn't for my assistants, things would've surely gotten out of hand and my lack of work would've been noticed by the other partners. But I was considerably nervous and wracked with the fear that every little siren and knock on my office door was the police coming to take me away.**

**As the days turned to weeks, I began to get a little more comfortable that I had gotten away with what I had done and I could go about my life.**

**Until** ***he*** **showed up.** 

**One late Friday night, I had perched myself in my recliner with a scary movie and snacks when I saw the silhouette of a man out the corner of my eye. Sure enough, there** ***he*** **stood. Mangled, bloodied, and twitching. Those goddamn twitches were unnatural and could frightened any man. Me included.**

**My nerves continued to wreck me for for days as I continued to see his apparition everywhere I went, a restaurant, work, home, everywhere. As the weeks went by, the more and more I saw him, the less frightening he became and the closer I got to him. I realized he served me no danger. Out of the mangled and twisted face I could make out angry and resentful eyes glaring at me, desperate to get their revenge. But he was powerless to do a damn thing to me, he could only watch me live.**

**Roughly five months had passed and I was leaving the judges chambers and walking through the now empty courtroom. A place I had always loved for its elegant beauty and design. As I stopped by the defendant's table to quickly reorganize my case binder, I saw him*****.*** **He was sitting at the plaintiff's table, right across from me, staring like he always does.** 

**By this time, his presence didn't give me any feeling of unease or fear. If anything, it agitated me.**

**"What?" I asked him. This is the first time I had actually spoken to him aside from my yelling and screaming at him in the first few weeks. But I was collected now.**

**"You think you're going to get your day in court? You're fucking dead. It's only me."**

**He just stared. The twitching getting more rapid as his eyes reflected anger and sadness.** 

**"You think you can just stalk me like this and expect sympathy?" I looked to the empty jury box behind him and listened to the imaginary jury foreman.**

**"Hear that?" I couldn't help but feel smug looking back at him as if he just heard the non-existent verdict. "They just ruled me not guilty." I slammed by briefcase closed, the resounding thud echoing through the massive room and vaulted ceiling.**

**He disappeared. But the silent sobs lingered for a few seconds longer.**

**I almost felt bad for the poor guy when I heard the sobs and realized I may have made an ass of myself. After all, it isn't his fault he decided to take a run on a desolate road in the middle of night. Maybe it was my fault. Hell, I know it was my fault.** 

**That country road was far from where I should've been. I never anticipated seeing anyone else, I just like long drives to squash down the intrusive thoughts and escape from the hectic life I stumbled into after law school. The alcohol that night only made it worse. In the few seconds of seeing him in my headlights, I listened to one of those thoughts, and I hit him head on.**

**Even though I was scared of what I did, the thrill of watching that man die in front of me felt exhilarating. For once, the intrusive thoughts left me alone to bask in the moment. When I tried to pull him out to toss his body in the ditch, I found that his leg was twisted in the rear axel. Explaining his scream and spurts of blood that coated my face and splotched my shirt.** 

**I'm not too proud of how I reacted when my shirt got stained. But I worked my ass off to wear the clothes I wear and live the life I do. I grew up poor, lived poor, and applied myself day in and day out to get to where I am, so you must understand why I got mad when blood stained my cotton white button down? I could've opted to just drive off and let his leg detangle itself, or I could do it myself.**

**I pretty sure the guy died while I was using the crowbar to detangle his leg. But I didn't care too much, the longer I sat on that road, the more of a risk I took of getting caught. All it would take was that one random person taking a midnight drive, or that one deputy who decided to patrol this side of bum-fuck county, and all I worked for would go away.** 

**It only took thirty minutes or so to pop him off, toss him in the weeds alongside the road and drive off as fast as I could. I assume the rest of his leg came off when I drove away.** 

**Since then, I have never felt better. I've gotten cleaner and more precise. I cycle through methods and tactics, careful to never adopt a modus operandi. I don't give a shit about the fame or notoriety, I already have that in my day job. I just want the pain and fear. For each new apparition to my collection, I feel a sense of intoxicating power course through me as they're forced to watch me live my life. Whether or not they're real or hallucinations matter not to me, all that matters is their pain and sorrow feels real.**

**To them in life, I am god. To them in death, I am the devil.**

**Now, you may wonder, is this real, or just another scary post you see on this site? After all, you see these types of stories everyday, so why would this not be any different? But you'll never know. Because you know there are horrible things people do to each other everyday. Things that never see the light of day. You'll never know who I am, where I work, or who I'm looking at. That is the purpose of this confession, to put the bug in your mind that there are always people like me out there. To make you fear what you can't see but you know is there.**

**For this is not a confession of guilt, rather a confession of pride.**

“*Take your mechanical forms, friends, and brave the air! One final time, I swear to you! OUR SALVATION LIES NOT WITH THE DREAMER, BUT WITH HIS SON. RISE, NOW, I BID YOU, RISE!”*

The terrible voice blares out from all angles as Wakka swings round the wheel of the boat, the spray rising high and catching against our clothes; our hair, Roxy’s in particular, blowing fiercely out behind.

The animatronic on the platform, a rusting suit of grey metal and silicone, the rough form of a man but with the head of a toad, becomes suddenly aware of us and our swift approach. His jaw clanks closed as the boat tears towards him across the surface of the flood. I see that what I mistook for legs are instead a single, thick series of pistons that, whilst giving the impression of the animatronic standing on the platform, actually extend down into the murky water behind.

“GET READY TO JUMP!” Wakka calls back to us, and I can feel my rage, my disgust at this world and its inhabitants and all they’ve put us through pumping through my veins as I prepare. As the platform grows closer and closer the boat does not slow. The toadman recoils awkwardly, his rusted pistons drawing him back, but too slow, far too slow, his jaw clanks open once again, but no voice is heard this time. The boat slams into him at full speed and shudders violently against the floating platform, sending it sprawling into the bars of a twisted, partly submerged section of rollercoaster rail. Roxy and John are thrown to the floor of the boat, but I am not. I fly forwards over the gap, slipping and stumbling dangerously and crashing, tumbling into a heap on the platform as it drifts uneasily in the water.

Swearing, and standing with stabs of pain across my shoulder and side, I twist to see the torn, broken lower half of the animatronic’s rusted pistons retreat joltingly into the water; the toadman himself, now disconnected from his ‘legs’, is crushed between the stilled, spluttering boat and the rails of the coaster.

I don’t waste any time. I sprint the length of the platform and jump across the watery gap, landing against the rails of the coaster and grunting, gripping tight to the warm metal, clambering up towards Stubs.

*Please be okay mate, please be okay.*

I can hear Roxy calling up below me. I think I can hear John, bellowing, I hear the sound of metal against metal, but I don’t look back. I only look ahead. Grimacing as I climb towards Stubs, I swing out an arm and slap him lightly across the face.

“Stubs! Stubs wake the fuck up! It’s Ollie! We’re here mate, we’re here to save you!”

He does not respond, but his eyelids flicker, and he groans. And for now, that’s enough.   
He’s alive. 

I loop one of my elbows through the rails and set to work untying the knots around his closest wrist. It doesn’t take long; the knots were not carefully tied.   
 His arm comes lose and his whole body slumps down, and my stomach lurches in panic that he might fall completely into the now-steadily bubbling waters below. He does not, but he does jerk awake in a fright.

“FUCK!” he chokes, spitting, coughing.

“STUBS!” I shout, unable to help the spread of a sudden grin across my face.

“Ollie?” he mutters, glancing down and realising at once how high above the water he’s tied. “Oh JESUS! FUCK! FUCK THIS!”

“Calm down mate, calm down!” I urge as I reach over for his other restraints. “This is your rescue. We’re getting you down and we’re getting the hell out of here. The others are below”.

His face contorts in confusion, then flashes with sudden remembrance. “Ollie! The- the air! They hate it! They need the water! It was my dad! I don’t-” he splutters, his thoughts a mess, struggling with his memories. “They’re trying to LEAVE, Ollie! This place! They’re going to use me as a GATE”.

“Not if we can help it”, I grunt, freeing him and shooting out an arm to hold him in place as he slips. I ask if he’s alright to climb, and once he replies that he is we descend, though our progress down the rails of the coaster is slow. 

The water bubbles violently, all around.

I jump back down onto the platform below and raise a hand, helping Stubs down too. He can walk by himself, but his legs shake, so I support him and we head to the far end of the platform. Perhaps now isn’t the best time, but I have to know, I just have to know…

“Stubs”, I ask as we hobble across, a little fearful of the answer, “did you know? …About this place, I mean? Did you know what was here? About all this?”

&#x200B;

“…No, no not really. I’m so sorry… They were just… just dreams”, he replies, muttering and wincing.

&#x200B;

The platform has drifted too far away from the boat, and we cannot re-board, so we stand at the end. I call across the water as it swirls and churns angrily below us. “WAKKA! Does the boat still work? Can you bring it around?”

Wakka does not hear me. He is, like John, attacking with force the broken body of the animatronic toadman. Trapped between the crushed bow of the pontoon boat and the twisted, bent rails of the coaster behind, his head jerks from left to right as Wakka and John swing down metal beams again and again. Roxy hears me though, and her eyes go wide as she looks over, her hands rising to her mouth.

“Eddie!” she calls over, “oh Eddie, you fucking idiot!”

Stubs does not respond, but he grins weakly at her.

Roxy gets Wakka’s attention and the group call out in relief, scrambling back into the boat. Wakka tries the ignition a few times, and the vessel grinds wearily with each attempt. The animatronic looks over to Stubs and myself as the boat, thankfully, returns to shuddering life.

The world begins to shake.

Creaking metal and shimmering, shifting water. Shapes move about in the darkness below.

The jaw of the toadman cranks open, and his crackly voice fills again the hidden speakers all around: “*Please… don’t leave us… don’t leave us again. Don’t abandon us as the Founder did”.* The boat begins to reverse and the rails of the coaster creak dangerously. The animatronic begins to slip, but still he speaks, his silicone-plastic expression fixed, but the desperation in his voice as clear as day:   
 “*The CHILD of the DREAMER can GUIDE THE WAY! We can ESCAPE! We can SAVE the brothers and sisters TRAPPED in the INBETWEEN! The fields APPROACH and the air is POISON! DON’T, PLEASE, DON’T LEAVE US HERE TO* ***ROT****!”*

But before I have real time to process his words, the boat breaks away from the rails of the coaster, and the animatronic falls, hitting the water with a smack. It quickly disappears beneath the murk with a final gurgle of distress.

The boat powers through the water towards us and we haul Stubs aboard, I clamber up behind as John clasps me on the back. Roxy is beside herself, shouting and laughing and squeezing Stubs as tightly as she can, she holds him and brings him down to a sitting position on the floor. 

“You know, Stubs”, Wakka calls back, “none of this would have happened if we’d just called the local council like I suggested”.

Stubs chokes out a laugh. “Fuck you Wakka”.

Wakka laughs in return, pushing down on the throttle as the water around us surges and the grinding of gears and the pumping of pistons rises into a frenzied uproar- the cry of a forgotten people- a people forced into a last, desperate assault as their final hope of escape threatens to disappear forever. An enormous grey-black tentacle of screaming metal and rotted canvas bursts from the floods behind and swings down towards us. Wakka’s knuckles turn white against the wheel and his voice ripples with sudden fire, an adrenaline-awakened confidence that I have never heard from him before- “HOLD TIGHT TO THE SIDES LADS, WE WON’T BE CAUGHT TODAY, I SWEAR TO YOU NOW!” And with a laugh bursting with fear and tinted with madness he slams forward the throttle and spins the wheel, and the boat careens round in a sharp circle, the tentacle crashing down to our side, whipping up a piercing and unwelcome spray.

I squint my eyes and grit my teeth, gripping tight to the rails at the side of the boat as it steadies and tears through the water, glancing off marks of ruin and broken wonders. Monsters and machines rise up from beneath, from everywhere, and the water rises with them. It has begun to swirl in waves, small at first with sources unknown, but they come heavier and faster, rocking and hammering against the boat.

“Just a little further”, I plead through my teeth, “come on... COME ON!”

I lift my gaze and look on ahead, and there’s the statue, the statue of Harry Lawson… the man… the man… responsible?… Responsible somehow for this fucking nightmare?   
 And yet, the statue is closer than it should be. It’s closer to the waterline. How could that be? Unless…

&#x200B;

…unless the water is rising.

&#x200B;

…*or the valley itself is sinking…*

&#x200B;

Wakka brings the boat round in an arc as unknown mechanisms below push and grind against it furiously; we stumble, and the boat half-docks half-crashes into the remains of a billboard, partly-submerged and fallen against the wet, grassy bank of the hill. We leap from the deck and onto the grass, though Stubs collapses to his knees upon landing, groaning. John hauls him to his feet and we scramble up the bank towards the entrance to the cave. 

I pause for a moment by the statue, trembling, my jaw set. I look up into his face.  
 There are so many more secrets here. We’ve only just scratched the surface, I know it.

&#x200B;

*What did you build here, exactly, Harry? Who did you leave behind?*

&#x200B;

“OLLIE!” John hollers down at me, “time to go mate!”

I nod, racing up the hill to the crack in the rock, casting one last look behind me.

The water crashes angrily against the side of the hill, as if it’s reaching out for us, calling for us. Something massive connects with the boat and the vessel appears to fold in on itself, the metal screeching and crunching as it crumbles and disappears, dragged down under the water. All manner of strange, amalgamated forms rise up now, clawing and wailing and jolting upwards with the rising tide, but there’s only one that meets my eye.

The crocodile-dragon. The animatronic from the pond. Grey-green and covered in moss. Amber, fibreglass eyes glowing with desperate fury, boring into mine as the churning water froths and sloshes around its base. The creature’s jaw clanks open, but I don’t stick around to hear what, if anything, it has to say.

Instead I turn, and I run. Back through the narrow passage in the cave. Back through the tunnels of rock.

The walls shake. The water rises. It swirls just below our knees. Roxy raises the torch.

Back onboard the wooden platform we climb, and though it has drifted with the rising water and we can no longer see the edge of the rocky bank, I am very, very welcome for its presence. It supports our weight, and I, perhaps riskily, hastily pull up another plank to allow both myself and John to paddle.

The animatronics we encountered here in this cave are nowhere to be seen, nor is it easy to tell if the bubbles are rising in the churning water. I can only presume they have sunk in return below the surface.

We stumble back into the pipe, and we run. We run and we slip and stagger in the rising water; John hoists Stubs onto his back in a fireman’s carry, but soon our options are narrowed even further. The water level becomes too high, and we have no choice but to swim.   
 The end of the pipe is visible, I can see it, I can see the grey light of the evening shine through it, but the water quickly continues to rise.

“COME ON!” I scream as we’re pushed closer and closer to the pipe’s ceiling, “WE’RE NEARLY THERE, WE’RE NEARLY THERE!”

&#x200B;

But we’re running out of time.

&#x200B;

My head hits the roof of the pipe.

&#x200B;

I choke on the water.

&#x200B;

I take a deep breath.

&#x200B;

And I am submerged.

&#x200B;

I open my eyes- through the water I can see the way ahead- a circle of light getting larger and larger- closer and closer-

&#x200B;

*Nearly… nearly….*

&#x200B;

I turn my head, looking for the others. I can see shapes swimming desperately besides me, but how many? Is that everyone?

&#x200B;

I force my arms and legs through the water as fast as I can.

&#x200B;

My lungs BURN with heated breath, aching for escape, contracting, screaming for renewal.

&#x200B;

And I’ve left the pipe. I turn upwards and madly kick my legs, with the last of my energy I claw my way towards the surface. The sounds of the rain against the pond grow louder and shadows shake in the corner of my eyes.

&#x200B;

…

&#x200B;

And I surface.

&#x200B;

I throw back my head and take in a deep, deep, cold lungful of fresh country air, choking, spluttering, taking in another as I drag myself up to the shore and into the mud of the bank, wheezing, coughing, greedily swallowing mouthfuls of rejuvenating oxygen. 

&#x200B;

….But, I am alone.

&#x200B;

*Where are the others?*

*Where are they?*

&#x200B;

I can’t go back in there; physically, I just can’t, I’ll drown, I can barely move.

&#x200B;

So instead I shiver and shake in the mud and the reeds, the rain spattering down all around as the long, green leaves of the willow trees rustle softly in the breeze.

“Guys!” I try to shout, but it comes out as a croak, “guys, please!”

&#x200B;

…And someone surfaces. Wakka. Wheezing, gasping for air, and then Roxy, and John… and then Stubs.

A sob of relief racks my body as they haul themselves out of the pond, collapsing around me in the mud, and for a while we do nothing but breathe, listening to the sounds of the rain, of our chests rising and falling, and sharing in the collective heat from our bodies.

&#x200B;

And once we feel like we are able, we rise, one at a time, until, as a group, we silently take our leave, trekking back down the path in a weary daze.

&#x200B;

…It isn’t until we pass that bloody rock... the rock with the shard of bronze stuck in the side of it. The rock that Stubs made us all touch on our way to the pond… when we hear a sudden voice from behind.

“Oi!” it shouts, and we turn to see a police officer, appeared from nowhere, staring at us in confusion. Firemen sprint past him in the distance. A helicopter hovers in the air far behind as a police van trundles awkwardly over the rough, wet terrain. He takes in our ghost-white faces, our clenched jaws and our soaked-through, mud-stained clothes.   
 “…Did one of you kids call about their brother falling into the pond…?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So.  
 It’s been two months since that night. Thank you for following my story. The more people know, in my view, the better. Here is what happened after.

The police were furious with us, for one thing. They took us home and lectured us, and our PARENTS, on wasting valuable police time. 

We went back to the pond the following week. Armed, I should add, with bats and knives, and we even touched the rock on our way round the hill… but the animatronic was gone. Absolutely no sign of it at all.

Roxy posted some pictures she’d taken with her phone of the amusement park to a bunch of online forums in a quest for knowledge. Stubs has been keeping a dream journal. He comes so, so maddeningly close to understanding, he says, they both do, but it always slips away when they wake up… Their mother has been no use. She refuses to acknowledge the story she is told and won’t divulge any new information about her late husband. But she’s hiding something, it’s obvious.

And I did end up asking Roxy out, by the way… with Stubs’ blessing, and she said yes… on the condition I rein in my short-temper.   
 I agreed, and I really have become so much better.

…

…But the relationship did not last particularly long. Just over a month, I’d say.

Because that’s when Stubs and Roxy vanished.

&#x200B;

Their mother left behind a curious public Facebook post: ‘so long’, basically. ‘Moving house’. ‘Good luck everyone, goodbye’.

Wakka and John and I were round within the hour, but the family has completely disappeared, the house has been emptied and with no word of a real goodbye, no texts, nothing. Just vanished. We returned as a trio to the pond, but the rock with the shard of bronze in it has gone, and the pond, to our utter surprise, has been filled in. Entirely replaced with rough, fresh earth. There were cameras set up around it, too. The secret camouflage-kinds that wildlife watchers use. Attached to the trunks of the trees.

We didn’t stay long.

&#x200B;

And this is not the end. It can’t be. Because I took something from the twisted world beyond the pipe. A few things, actually. One dangles on a piece of cord around my neck, and another around Wakka’s, and a third around John’s.

Pieces of bronze. Shards of shattered bronze from the base of the statue of Harry Lawson. Of Stubs’ and Roxy’s father.

*Dreamer.*

*Pioneer.*

*Founder.*

The same bronze that we found stuck in the wall of the cavern. The same bronze embedded in Stubs’ rock. And we’ve all begun having the dreams, now. Difficult to hold onto, but they are there. And they show to us glimpses of Roxy. They show us glimpses of Stubs. Not in the world of the floods, the world of the ruined and desolate theme park, but somewhere else, somewhere new.

And I swear to you now, my friends.

We’re going to find them.

Whatever it takes.

&#x200B;

We’ll get them back.

My mother and I have always been close. Ever since I was a child she was the person who cared for me the most. At least that’s how I felt. Of course, I had my father as well. And grandparents. But nothing ever came close to the bond I shared with my mother.

Granted, this was probably because my mother was the only person in my family who was…willing to do stuff with me. We’d go out to the supermarket or play ball in the backyard, and on rainy evenings we’d cuddle up close and do crossword puzzles or watch TV. She’d always tell me I was her pride and joy, and I mean, what kid doesn’t like hearing that? 

Things changed when I started attending first grade. I’d never set foot in kindergarten or any preparatory classes, so the concept of school was entirely alien to me. But mother said I had to go.

“That’s the law,” she scoffed, as if it’d been some major inconvenience, “I’ll pick you up right after.”

That’s a promise she certainly kept. Every single day she’d drop me right in front of the school and would be waiting for me the second I set foot outside the gates. 

One time, after the last bell rang, I tagged behind some of my classmates to listen in on their discussion about a new movie that was coming out in theaters, and didn’t even notice my mother walking rapidly towards me. She grabbed my arm as soon as I exited the gates.

“Who are those boys?” she demanded.

“I- I don’t know, mom…they’re just my classmates!”

My words seemed to alleviate the crease in her forehead, “Well, don’t waste your breath talking to them. You’re much too clever for that.”

I nodded, watching as the boys in question gestured excitedly to their own parents.

That’s another thing about my childhood. I was never allowed to have any friends. Well, it wasn’t like the other kids in my school were particularly interested in me either way. Certainly not enough to sit next to me at lunch or even lend me a pencil. My parents never really bothered with school supplies and thought that a pen and a block of A4 paper would suffice for whatever ‘shenanigans’ we got up to.

“What do they really teach kids in first grade anyway?” my mother shook her head, lighting up a cigarette, “If you need any other supplies, just ask your father. He’ll be in his office.”

But I never went near the office. In fact, I didn’t much like my father at all. He always sat in front of his computer and never took any notice of me. And he always smelled strongly of alcohol. I shuddered at the thought. 

“It’s… It’s okay, mom, I’ll manage,” I said, praying she wouldn’t send me there anyway, “I’m sure I can just borrow some colored pencils from the teacher.”

“That’s my boy,” she said, ruffling my hair.

I never asked for anything after that. Not when we learnt to fold origami, not when we made Christmas cards, and definitely not when we modeled animals out of clay. 

“Could… Could I borrow some glue?” I asked a boy named Thomas, who sat nearest to me. 

That day, we were scrapbooking, and my shark cut-out wouldn’t stay glued down, despite being almost drenched in spit. 

But Thomas only wrinkled his nose and sniggered, “Look guys, Stinky is drooling all over his page!”

The other children laughed, but I was mortified. That became my nickname from that point on. *Stinky.* I had no idea why they called me that. I bathed and showered regularly and my clothes were always clean and ironed. 

“Oh, don’t pay them any mind,” my mother said, “They’re kids! You know what I was called at school? *Fidgety Fran.* That’s right. *See?* It isn’t so bad. If they call you names, just call them names back. There’s a good boy. Now, go give grandma a kiss and she’ll read you a bedtime story.”

I hesitated, “Mom, can you read the bedtime story, please?”

“Why? Grandma’s already waiting for you in your bedroom, I helped her all the way up the stairs…”

“Please, mom…Grandma reads so slowly…”

“Oh…alright, kiddo. Go choose a book then. But only for tonight, eh?”

I nodded happily and ran up the stairs to give grandma her goodnight kiss. 

To say I was lonely would have been an understatement. Of course, I loved and valued my family, but friendship with children my own age was a concept I had never experienced. I watched with envy as my classmates swapped the lunches their parents had packed for them, played tag during break times and whispered to each other when the teacher wasn’t looking. I knew I wasn’t allowed to, but I longed to have a friend of my own. 

Little did I know, my wish was about to come true. And not at all in the way I expected.

Mitch joined our class just after Easter. Apparently, his family had relocated and our school was one of the only ones to have an opening. I remember feeling quite sorry for him as our teacher propped him up on her desk in front of the entire class to make an introduction. 

It was obvious that Mitch was different from the other kids. He wore sandals instead of sneakers, tweed trousers instead of jeans, and carried a large worn briefcase in place of a backpack. 

“It’s my dad’s…” he whispered, when he caught me looking at it during lunch, “He said I could have it for school.”

I nodded, not wanting to risk hurting his feelings. The table next to mine had been empty, so our teacher had assigned the seat to Mitch. I wouldn’t have minded, if the arrangement hadn’t made even more of a spectacle out of me.

“Look, the weird new kid is talking to Stinky!” Thomas jeered, causing the class to erupt into a fit of giggles.

But Mitch didn’t even bat an eye.

“Wanna be friends?” he asked, holding out his hand. On his palm was a bar of chocolate. I drooled at the sight. The most my mother ever packed for me was a piece of fruit or half-a-slice of toast. I knew Mitch’s offering came with a price - we’d have to be friends. 

“O-okay…” I whispered, gingerly taking the chocolate from him and clutching it in my palms.

I couldn’t believe it. I had a friend. 

Immediately, sirens blared in my brain, as I thought of my mother’s reaction. I couldn’t tell her. She’d been so angry that time she thought she saw me talking to my classmates, she’d be livid if she knew I really was. 

So, I made sure to say goodbye to Mitch before I reached the school gates every afternoon and pretended I didn't know him whenever my mother was nearby. One time, our parents dropped us off at the same time and I had to dash inside before my mother could get any ideas.

“Why were you running?” he’d asked when he caught up with me in the school hallway, “Class doesn’t start for another twenty minutes.”

“Oh, it’s just…” I mumbled under my breath, “I just like running.”

“Hm,” it was clear Mitch didn’t believe a word I was saying, “Listen, my mom asked if you’d like to come over this afternoon for dinner. She’s making lasagna. She said she could call your mom to tell her.”

“No!” the words came rushing out before I could stop them, “I can’t! I…I…it’s my grandma’s birthday and I can’t miss it.”

“Okay,” Mitch shrugged, “Another day then.”

I knew I wouldn’t be able to keep this up for long. I’d have to come clean. But how do you tell the only friend you’ve ever had that even speaking to him is akin to treason? Plus, I never even understood why I wasn’t allowed to have friends, let alone speak to kids my own age. I’d asked, but my mother was adamant that family was the only thing that really mattered.

“But other kids have friends!” I wailed.

“Other kids also call you nasty names. Do you *really* want to be like them? You’re so much better than that, Sam, we love you for you!”

I believed her. I mean, I wanted to believe her. Until that fateful day when everything literally went to shit. 

“I’m not going to be able to pick you up today, sweetheart,” my mother said as we pulled up to the school gates, “Can you walk home by yourself? It’s only a few blocks and -”

But I barely heard the rest. *Walk home?* All by myself? My mother had never even been a second late before, and now she was trusting me to get home all on my own?

“Now, don’t forget - look both ways before you cross the road and heat up the grilled cheese in the microwave.”

I stared at her in stunned silence, “When…when will you be back?”

“Oh,” she waved her hand dismissively, “I shouldn’t be too long. Just some errands. You’ll be fine, honey. If you need anything, just ask your dad, he’ll help. Grandma’s coming with me, so she won’t be around.”

I winced at the thought of asking dad anything, but nodded, “Okay, mom.”

“There’s a good boy,” she smiled, planting a kiss on my forehead, “Off you go.”

So, off I went. By the time I sat down at my desk I was almost giddy with excitement. I was being trusted to walk home all by myself. My mother had even given me the key to the house. Suddenly, I felt sophisticated and grown up. Not even Thomas and his buddies could bother me that day. 

I was out the door the moment lessons were over, Mitch tailing me.

“Hey, where are you running off to?” he called, “Wait up!”

“I’m walking home on my own today,” I announced proudly, “My mom is running some errands and said she can’t pick me up.”

“Oh,” he looked intrigued, “Can I come over?”

I gawked at him, unsure of whether he was kidding or not, “Er…?”

“It’s alright, I’ll let my mom know at the gate! I’m sure she won’t mind!”

“Uh…it’s not…I’m not sure if…”

“What?” his tone was piercing.

I thought about it for a moment. This could be my chance to actually have a friend over for the first time in my life. My mother never had to know. She and grandma would be out for the next couple of hours and dad never came out of his study anyway. 

“You know what?” I said, taking a deep breath, “You can come over. We’ll… hang out.”

“Great!” Mitch looked genuinely pleased, “It’s about time!”

Still, I felt wary as we exited the school gates, looking around for my mother’s car or a familiar face. 

“What’s wrong?” Mitch asked, “Why are you so twitchy?”

“I-...It’s nothing, really,” I stammered, “Can we walk faster?”

We sped down the sidewalk, Mitch’s leather briefcase slapping against his shin with each step. 

“How far is your house?” he inquired, clearly out of breath.

“It’s close,” I replied, my heart hammering unevenly in my chest.

What if mother’s car was in the driveway? What if she was waiting for me to get home to see if she could trust me? What would she say when she saw I wasn’t alone?

“Is this it?” Mitch asked as we turned into the cul-de-sac, “The yellow one?”

“Yeah,” I nodded, fumbling in my pocket for the key, “This way.”

I led him up the steps and stuck the key into the lock. My heart was practically leaping out of my throat and my skin was clammy with sweat as I opened it. 

“Mom?” I called out instinctively, praying there’d be no response.

*Silence.*

I heaved a sigh of relief and ushered Mitch inside, slamming the door shut behind him. 

“Wow…” he said, his nose wrinkling, “What…what is that smell?”

I stared at him, “What smell?”

“Can’t you smell that? It’s like…pickles?”

“Pickles?”

Mitch half nodded, half shook his head, an expression of disgust on his face. 

“Sorry,” I said quickly, “Maybe someone’s been cooking?”

I showed him into the kitchen, but there didn’t seem to be any mysterious new dish in sight. 

“We have some…leftover grilled cheese?” I said sheepishly, not daring to meet his eye.

“Cool,” Mitch seemed unfazed, “Shouldn’t we say hello to your dad? You said he’d be in, right?”

“Yeah, but…” I tried to think of the proper thing to say, “We don’t have to, really…He’s probably busy in his study…”

“Well, it won’t take a minute. We’ll just say hello.”

My heart skipped a beat.

“No, really. I don’t talk to my dad much.”

“Oh,” Mitch looked slightly taken aback, “Alright, then.”

We ate yesterday’s grilled cheese in silence. I saw Mitch looking around the room curiously, his gaze fixating on a stack of cleaning supplies sitting by the sink. I waited for him to ask questions, but he didn’t say anything. 

“So, what do you want to do now?” he asked, wiping his greasy lips with the back of his sleeve, “Should we go up to your room?”

I glanced at the clock. Half an hour had passed since we’d gotten home. Mom and grandma weren’t due for another hour and a half. Still, I figured it’d be better to see Mitch off thirty minutes early just in case. 

“Sure…But only for an hour, okay? Then, you’ll have to go.”

Mitch studied me, a puzzled look on his face, but nodded all the same. We trudged up the stairs, our school bags in tow. 

“Actually, could I use your bathroom real quick?” Mitch said, dropping his belongings onto my bed.

“Yeah! It’s down the hall, first door on the left.”

Nonchalantly, I waved towards the room in question. I felt really grown up. We never had guests at my house, aside from the occasional postman or drunk partygoer, so having a friend over felt new and alien to me, but I loved it all the same. 

I was just pulling out my selection of board games from the cupboard, when a high-pitched shriek pierced the air. I felt like I’d been punched in the gut. My skin prickling, I dashed into the corridor. Mitch was standing hunched over and retching last night’s grilled cheese onto the carpet.

“Oh! Mitch!” I cried, staring at the mess he’d made, “I’ll never get this out in time!”

But Mitch wasn’t listening. He stood there, sobbing and clutching his feverish face. I noticed he was shaking.

“W-what’s wrong?” I asked, alarmed by his sudden change in demeanor, “Is it the food?”

He looked up at me, his eyes brimming with tears, his face contorted into an expression of disgust, “What is *wrong* with you?”

I gawked at him, taken aback, “Wha- what do you mean?”

And then I saw it. The door to my grandfather’s room was ajar. Mitch must have mixed up his right and left.

“Stay away from me,” Mitch raised his hands, “I’m going home.”

A strong smell of pickle juice and alcohol wafted from my grandfather’s room and I rushed over to shut the door, my eyes burning.

“Don’t go, Mitch! Please!” I struggled to find the right words, “It’s only grandpa!”

“You’re crazy!” Mitch cried, “*Only grandpa?* Or what’s left of him? How long has he been sitting there?!”

Tears rolled down my cheeks as I pictured Mitch finding my grandfather. His skin covered in pupae, his mouth crawling with maggots. 

“It’s only natural,” my mother would tell me, whenever I’d feel hesitant to help her, “That’s why we have to bathe him frequently.”

“Mitch, I…” I whispered, “You’re my best friend. Please, don’t leave…”

His eyes suddenly widened.

“Is…is that why we can’t see your dad?” he muttered, slowly backing away from me down the corridor, “Is that it?”

I didn’t know what to tell him. My family was all I’d ever known. For the longest time I thought this was the way things were meant to be. 

Suddenly, the door slammed downstairs.

Mother was home.

“Sam?” she called, “We’re back!”

We froze. My heart was galloping in my chest and making me feel lightheaded. What on earth was I going to do? How would I explain this?

“Hello?” mother called again, “Anyone home?”

I cleared my throat, “Yes, mom!”

My voice wasn’t much more than a squeak. I felt so frightened, I wanted to fall to my knees and weep, but I couldn’t let Mitch down. 

“There you are!” mother said, coming up the stairs, “Did you get home from school oka-?”

Her gaze swept over the vomit on the carpet. And then to me and Mitch. I could see the panic in her eyes before she even said anything.

“Wh-who’s this?” she whispered, staring at my friend. 

I stood still, my head hung low, waiting for whatever was going to happen next. 

“Sam? Who is this?”

I heard Mitch draw a deep breath, “I’m Mitch. From school. It’s nice to meet you, Sam’s mom.”

The silence was almost deafening. It was a while before I dared look up. My mother was still standing on the stairs, a distant look in her eyes. 

“I’m sorry, mom,” I managed, “It was an accident.”

I wasn’t sure what I was apologizing for. I didn’t know why my mother was so upset. Was it the vomit on the carpet? Was it my new friend? Was it something about grandma?

“You…you have no idea what you’ve done,” my mother whispered, shaking her head slowly, “You’ve ruined us. You’ve destroyed this family.”

I stared at her, my eyes welling up with tears again, “I- I’m sorry, mom, I didn’t-”

But she wasn’t listening, “Get downstairs and bring the formaldehyde. The one in the brown bottle. And some rags. I’ll take care of this.”

But I stood there, unmoving.

“Now, Sam!” she snapped, climbing up the rest of the stairs and facing us, “Quickly! Before someone comes looking!”

I knew perfectly well what was about to happen. This wasn’t the first time my mother had asked me to bring her the brown bottle. In fact, she used it religiously every week. 

“Mom, no…” I tried, “Mitch is innocent. It was me who brought him home. Please…”

But she only shook her head, “It has to be done, Sam. You don’t want mommy to go away, do you?”

Suddenly, she didn’t look anything like my mother. Her face was creased with deep lines and her scalp was slick with perspiration. 

“Please, mom…” I begged, “Mitch is my friend…”

But she wasn’t having it. 

“I am your friend. You have your family. Isn’t that enough for you? I won’t let this destroy what we have. If you won’t help me…” she swallowed, “...I’ll just have to do it myself.”

With that, she charged towards us like an enraged bull. We screamed, turning to run, but there was nowhere to go. Mother grabbed Mitch by his arm and dug her nails in until he screamed. 

“Please!” he cried, thrashing about, “Please help me, Sam!”

But there was nothing I could do. I screamed and cried as mother dragged Mitch into the bathroom and the lock clicked. After a few minutes, the screams ceased and the house went quiet. All I could hear was the sound of my heartbeat in my ears and my own muffled sobs. 

Of course, the police found out anyway. Mitch had told his parents he was going to my house at the school gates, and as the evening drew to a close they’d started to worry. The phone rang several times that night, but mother didn’t want to pick it up. She said she was too tired and just wanted to take a nap. 

Eventually, a police car pulled up to our house and she was left with no choice. They took her away and that’s how I ended up in foster care. I got to visit my mother once a year, but as time went on, and as I got older, I stopped going. She was different, somehow. More and more unhinged each time I went to see her. 

I did eventually make friends. Lots of them. After being deprived of contact for so long, I made friends left and right to make up for lost time. But I never forgot about my family. Not even when I was old enough to move out and get a place of my own. 

I’m in my late thirties now, but I still often think about them. I think about the day the prison called to tell me my mother had died. They’d asked me to arrange a burial, and I promised I would. It’s been two years since then and I’m still getting round to it…

But it’s just so comforting having my mother in my living room.

So, I think some background info is required, (bare with me I'm dyslexic and autistic so some parts of what I'm saying may not make full sense but please keep in mind I am also in panic mode currently) 

So I (19f) went to my local ASDA for some shoping with my gf (22f), just as we finished shopping and were going to leave I remembered I forgot to get batteries and told her to go home without me.

I walked in like normal and bought the batteries, went to the bathroom and went to walk yo the exit. I was looking and looking but couldn't find it anywhere, I tried to find an employee to ask for directions but I couldn't find one.

So anyway it had been about an hour at that point so I just kept looking for the exit, but here's the thing, u found someone who is in the same position as myself, his name is Mortem, he said he's been here for 'quite some time' whatever that means.

I don't quite know how to feel though, I've had two breakdowns in the last 4 hours, Mortem said something about how when the lights go out we need to stay in the bathrooms but that sounds ridiculous, it a 24hr ASDA, the lights won't just turn off for no reason.

Around about an hour ago I finally saw a worker but Mortem dragged me the other direction and told me to be quiet. . .

It's currently 00:03 and I'm currently in a bathroom stall typing all this rn, the lights are still on but still. I'm getting the creeps around Mortem. I can't put my finger on where I've heard that name before too. . .

I don't even know if this will work, my messages I've sent my gf haven't even went threw and I'm worried that she may think I've left her behind.

So things are getting weirder and scarier. When I woke up this morning Mortem was gone, I waited for about 30 minutes before i went into the boys bathroom to see the walls were covered in what I can only assume is blood, it looked kinda brown but also red. And I screamed, I heard something crash behind me only to see that an entity like creature that was wearing an ASDA uniform was walking towards me, the creature looked completely human, the only reason I'm calling it an entity is because it has an unusually long face, it lookes like its straight out of the Mandela catalog thingy that's on YouTube, but this thing looked more human like than that, it was unsettling how hollow that things eyes looked

It had hollow looking eyes, long black hair, pale taned skin, pitch black nails and it appeared to be crying..? I don't know if it was actually crying or not but it just asked me "is there an issue ma'am?" In an almost robotic voice, I asked where the exit was and it asked me what an exit was! Like what the heck!? I'm getting more and more scared as the time goes on. . .

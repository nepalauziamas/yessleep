So, uh... *REALLY* don't know what to say here, other than I'm pretty sure I’m surrounded by dead people. No, I don't mean that I'm seeing ghosts or zombies or anything like that. But I mean that I see them, their faces; faces of people I know for a fact *were* dead, now walking around, perfectly well and alive.

Am I the only one that's noticed it? Well, probably, considering I'm not seeing or hearing more people talking about this. Either that, or I'm in even deeper into some real shit than I realized. If that's the case, then I'll have to keep this relatively brief and as soon as I finish writing this, I'll have to get gone quickly.

If I had to guess, this *might've* started with that commercial. It was for this new beauty care product called "NuFaCe", claiming to be able to "instantly transform you into a whole new you!" You know, standard fare; "*We can do what doctors and dermatologists can't*" pitch. Hell, here's an excerpt from one of their earliest commercials;

***"...NuFaCe., like putting on a whole new skin! In only seconds -- that's right; SECONDS -- You can accomplish what would take plastic surgery HOURS, even DAYS, to accomplish; at less than a FRACTION of the cost and less than half the pain! You can call and book an appointment with your cosmetologist today to get your brand NuFaCe; but hurry, Supplies won't last long!"***

Now, the commercial itself, at least back then, was nothing special; just some hyperactive yahoo spouting the product's praises while a basic diagram of a person's face was on the screen; changing from before and after use. I personally thought nothing of it. I had no use for it, and I honestly didn't figure many others would either. I figured most would've looked at this and said "Huh... interesting, next."

Obviously, though, since I'm here; talking about this, that's not what happened. It was a slow rise, sure, but it made it and eventually, I was seeing a bunch of social media threads with the stuff. I remember not being able to open Facebook for a week and a half without seeing *at least* three or four of my friends posting about **"Got my NuFaCe today! #NewYearNewMe"**, along with twenty-something odd other random people's posts on it.

Again, this was just back when it first came out, about nine or ten months ago now. I should also mention that it only seemed to be available in my city; Pinebrook, N.C. I tried at one point, out of sheer curiosity, to look to see *just* how widespread it was. Nowhere else seemed to offer the product, though. I'm not sure how much longer that's gonna stay the case, though, which, if what I've seen is true, could be a real nightmare for us all.

So yeah, it was quite a fad. The way they did it *was* remarkable, I will say (you know; before I found out *how* they were pulling it off). I remember seeing a lot of speculations on Facebook and such, either asking if anyone knew what the secret was or just straight up coming up with blown out the ass theories; spouting a bunch of scientific jargon nobody (including themselves, more than likely) understood.

Any way you sliced it, the results were *there!* People posting before and after pics were showing how, when they went in for the “treatment” or “operation”, they looked VASTLY different. Some were gaunt and had wrinkles, liver spots, and just generally exhausted or sickly. After they got it, though, they’d come out looking unrecognizable. They’d look younger, healthier, as opposed to the aforementioned elderly, homeless, or drug addict type of look I described before.

Soon, of course, I began seeing some of these people out and about on the streets. Some of them were people I kinda new; people I used to remember seeing frequently out and about, either out shopping, grabbing chips and smokes from the 7/11, or lounging around the bus stop just up the street from the Publix. All of them now had a “NuFaCe”.

They looked completely different, like they weren’t even the same people anymore. A few of them, a few of the ones I’d occasionally talk to (not a very outgoing person, by the way), I had to ask who the hell they were. One time, I asked a lady if they’d just blown into town here in the sticks from New York or something, being that hers made her look like a magazine model. She laughed and said “No, you goof, it’s me, Kristina, from the bar.”

I looked confused at her. “You know, the one you keep getting your Yaeger bombs from every Friday night — which you still have quite the tab racked up for, by the way.” Sure enough, she was telling the truth. It *was* her voice, which I recognized from her sort of “country girl” accent, but it wasn’t her face.

Her face used to be kind of rounded, with a dimple showing every time she’d smile. Now, her face was a bit more pointed at the chin, longer too. Her skin around her face was a bit darker now, too; where it was a very light white color before. It was different. All of it. Not necessarily *bad*, but definitely different.

*It was off...*

“Oh, uh... sorry.” I said, chuckling nervously. I *did* have a bit of a thing for her (hence the Friday night bar trips). “I didn’t recognize you. You look different.” She chuckled again and told me she’d gotten a “NuFaCe” procedure done.

“It was painless and didn’t need to use no funny gas or *nothin’!* It was over before I knew it, and the best part; I only had to pay $150 for it!” She winked and said “So, what ya think?”

“It looks...” I stumbled. I wasn’t really sure what to say. Sure, she looked *hot* with the new look (though, again, I thought she looked cute enough the way she was before). But something about it, how... I don’t know, I guess just how different, how *new* I guess you could say it looked on her, caused me to hesitate, freezing my tongue.

Her face began to sink a little, noticing my hesitation. I had to think of something to say quick to keep from hurting her feelings. Finally, I worked up the gumption to say “It looks different. It looks new.”

“That mean ya like it?” She asked shyly.

“Yeah, I mean, it’s just so weird seeing you look so different, not even recognizing you, you know?”

Her face fell again. “Oh,” she said, disappointed, “well... okay, uh... see you Friday?” I chuckled just as awkwardly and answered that I wouldn’t make it, having to work late that night. It was an obvious lie, but I guess she picked up on the point and she just said she’d see me around before walking away.

This wasn’t exactly the only occasion like this, where friends and other people I knew weren’t recognizable anymore to me (though it was the only time shit got embarrassing like that). Pretty soon, it got to a point where I was basically the only one in town that I knew of that *didn’t* have a “NuFaCe”.

I could’ve cared less for it, don’t get me wrong, but I can’t lie and say it didn’t feel weird being the only one that wasn’t walking around with a different looking face. By that point, too; maybe a month later, commercials were more frequent for it. Now, some were even featuring celebrity sponsorships; including famous actors. All of them claimed to have undergone the procedure. In other words, it’s very much possible that the way you see some of these people look on TV, *ISN’T* how they *actually* looked when they were born, if you take my meaning.

And the worst part, I don’t think *they* even know what it *actually* is they’re wearing. I don’t think any of them know. Only, of course the people performing the surgery... and, well... now me.

I know this is a lot, and I know they’re after me now because of what I know; what I’ve seen. But others need to know. Others need to know, because, like I said, the popularity of this thing is growing more and more, and it scares the hell out of me what I believe will happen soon if no one shares this.

It was last Friday when it started to take a downward dive for me. By then, “NuFaCe” had been on the scene for almost seven months, with it seeming to only get more and more popular. I’d gotten used to — well, *mostly* gotten used to — seeing everyone looking completely different from what they had before.

Again, I personally felt fine just the way I was, so why change it, even if it was only $150? But at the same time, who was I to judge? Other people wanna dump their money into that shit, more power to ‘em.

Others though, I noticed start looking at me weird. Some would ask me if I’d gotten one or when I was gonna get one. When I told them my feelings on it, they’d look at me like I was telling them I turned down an offer to live in a mansion or something. It didn’t bother me too much, but it *was* annoying.

Because of this, I took to going out less and less during the day, besides work; instead deciding I’d just go out at nighttime. Given how small Pinebrook is, things were usually quiet come nightfall. And add the fact that it got nice and cool when the sun went down, and you had a nice place for a nighttime stroll.

That is, until that Friday night when, during my little weekly bar hop I mentioned earlier, my buddy, Nester, showed me a thing on his newsfeed about areas of a local cemetery being found exhumed, the bodies missing. No names had been listed as to exactly *who* the missing deceased were, as it was a sort of “This just in” type deal — no time for any real investigation to have been launched yet.

“Why do they do it, Don?” Nester asked me, knocking back his fifth shot of Jack that night.

“Hell if I’d know.” I replied, chuckling dryly. “Where’d that happen, anyway?” He looked at the article on his phone for a moment.

“Hey, hold on, man... look here.” He held the phone up to me and pointed out a paragraph he’d had highlighted. “Ain’t that just a ways up the road, mid-way out of Pinebrook?”

I read the passage. Sure enough, he was right. The article read that, at around 9:45 the night before, the groundskeeper for Morning Gate Cemetery, which like Nester said, was just outside of town, reported to police that at least seven plots had been dug up and the bodies were gone. My eyes went wide at this.

“How the hell?” I exclaimed.

“I know, right?” Nester added.

Admittedly, while I was kinda spooked, I was curious more than anything else. Who and just how the hell did somebody dig up and make off with SEVEN bodies without anyone knowing? Of course, the bigger, and more frightening question pushed this one to the back of my mind; Why?

What was worse, though, was how this happened not too far from the bar, maybe ten or fifteen minute's walking distance. The thought of some creep out there, so close to home, snatching bodies for god only knew what sent me into goosebumps. It was enough to make me risk my life that night having Nester drive me home, despite being pretty buzzed, rather than walk home like I usually did. *"At least I won't run into some creep."* I thought.

Once I got home, though, ironically enough, I'd all but forgotten about the article. Everything was just fine. That was, until about noon the next day when Nester sent me another link to a news article. It was a follow-up about another three bodies going missing from Morning Gate, including the groundskeeper himself. Above was his picture.

\-- "What the hell?!"

**-- "I know right?! That was** ***LAST NIGHT***\*\*, too!"\*\*

\-- "While we were at the bar?! Jesus christ!"

**-- "Yeah, just before we left. And you see what happened to the old buzzard runnin' the place, right; old man Granger?"**

\-- "Yeah, it says he's missing, too."

**-- "'Missing'? More like on the run, I'm almost willing to bet."**

\-- "What do you mean?"

**-- "Come on, think about it. You know as well as I do that place gets locked tighter than a damn high school locker come nightfall, right?"**

\-- "Yeah, so?"

**-- "So that, plus, unless you're frickin' Spider-man, good luck scaling the fence around the place, means that Granger was the only person who'd have access to the grounds at nighttime."**

I was stumped there. He had a point, the old man WAS the only one that could've accessed the grounds AND the bodies. No one else, or at least it was *highly* unlikely at the time, could've gotten in.

\-- "Okay, but why?"

**-- "Like you said, "Hell if I'd know". Though, it's not like Old Granger was entirely your average joe, you know?"**

Once again, he had a point. I'd only interacted with the guy a handful of times before. While he wasn't mean or unfriendly, he *was* a little odd. Of course, he *was* pushing 68 (even if he only *looked* like he was 45 or 50) and he spends every night in a frickin' graveyard, watching over dead people, so can you really be surprised there? That being said, I didn't figure him for the type to actually wanna dig them up and steal them.

*"But then, who else?"*

\-- "If it *was* him, though, why'd he report it the other night to the authorities?"

**-- "You mean besides the fact that he was cracking; probably for the attention. Either that, or to try and shift the blame, like he is now with his 'disappearance'. Anyhow, it's karaoke night at the bar tonight, you in?"**

I didn't reply. I was barely comfortable leaving my house during daylight, and now this. No, needless to say, that was it for my late night excursions for a while. Especially if Nester's theory about the old man was true -- and again, I couldn't exactly prove him wrong -- and he really *was* out there, hiding somewhere, then it was a good bet that that somewhere wasn't far from the cemetery.

That, above everything else, kept me tossing and turning that night, as well as the night after. I stayed holed up in my house both days straight, only opening the door for the pizza guy. I'd have stayed in Tuesday, too (Hell, I'd have likely never come out of my house again if I could), but unfortunately, "Body snatching maniac on the loose" wasn't quite a good enough excuse for me to miss shifts at work. I guess, in that vein, I luckily only worked the morning shifts, meaning I'd be off by no later than 4:00.

Despite this, I was still skittish; constantly darting my eyes around everywhere, thinking I'd find him staring back at me. This turned out to be a real pain, as it meant that I couldn't really focus which, being a cashier at the convenience store, meant multiple instances where I'd fuck up and forget to give a customer the correct change. Finally, my lunch break rolled around and I was able to at least get away from the register for a while.

Once I'd punched the clock for lunch, I decided to grab a bag of cheetos, a frosted honey bun and a Dr Pepper to munch on (nothing like a little junk food to calm your nerves when you're on the lookout for a maniac, right?). That was when I looked up and saw him. Right there, right in the front of my fuckin' face on the other side of the shelf where the chips were, was old man Granger himself.

My eyes went wide, color draining from my face. *"Oh god, he's here! HE'S RIGHT HERE! WHAT DO I DO?!"* Every instinct told me to bolt for the phone and dial the police, but I just stood there, frozen.

"Hey there, Donny!" he exclaimed excitedly in a voice that I was pretty sure wasn't Granger's. "We missed ya last night at the bar. Shit, you should've seen me up on the stage, singin' 'Sweet Child O' Mine'!" He chuckled before asking how I've been.

I still stood frozen. Now I was more confused than frightened. "Keith, that you?" He barked an obnoxious laugh.

"Well yeah, last I checked. At least, I hope I ain't drank so much that I forgot who the hell I was." I continued staring stupidly at him. *"That's Keith alright. But why does he look like old man Granger? HOW?"*

"What's wrong, you see a ghost or somethin'?" he asked.

"Oh, uh... no, I just..." I didn't know what I was supposed to say. "I didn't know it was you there. I thought it was... well, someone else." He cocked his eyebrow at me.

"Don't know how. Last I checked, there's only one a' me."

"Yeah, but you look different, I didn't recognize you. You get a 'NuFaCe'?"

He barked out another laugh and said, "Ohh, yeah, that. Yeah, I got this done last Wednesday. Connie was gettin' one; which by the way, made her look better than she did back when she was 18, an' she told me I should get one, too. And shit, I couldn't beat the results, or the price, even with a lifetime supply o' botox."

"I see..." I replied, anxiety flooding through my body. He told me that the one he got was a "Fresh sample". For some reason, this alarmed me. "What? What does that mean?"

"Well, from what the Docs' say, it was a fresh new one they had sent in to 'em jus' the night before."

My legs started shaking, *"'Brand new'? 'Just sent in'? But then..."* 

"And exactly when did you say you got this done?" I asked. A horrifying feeling was quickly worming its way up from my stomach, causing me to feel nauseous. 

"A couple days ago. Saturday, I believe." He stroked his chin, the chin of old man Granger, and added, "Yeah, I remember cause I was excited to show up sportin' the new look to the mic that night."

That did it. I quickly booked it to the bathroom where I promptly emptied my stomach. By the time I was done, I was left feeling dizzy. Not only that, but now I was more scared than ever. Now, I knew it wasn't Granger who was snatching the bodies from the cemetery, sure, but now that instilled an all new fear into me. Now, I didn't know who or what to expect. 

Then, another thought occurred to me. Keith didn't even know that was old Granger's face he was now wearing. That got me thinking about everyone else in town I saw, walking around with a "NuFaCe". *"Was it the same for them?"* 

After just barely managing to finish my shift that day, I bolted home quicker than I ever had before, looking over my shoulder the entire time, and locked myself in the house. Once I was at least relatively certain no one was following me, or able to break in if they were, I started looking again at the news link Nester sent me. As far as the case of the missing bodies from Morning Gate Cemetary went, the police were still investigating (still at a loss). 

I then decided, against all better judgement, to look into my haunting little hunch a little further. I started looking to see if any of the cemeteries close by had had any sort of incidents. After about five minutes of searching, though, I found nothing for any graveyards closer to town than Morning Gate. I should've stopped there, I know -- and god knows I wish I had (Hell, I'd have been perfectly fuckin' fine never bein' the wiser about any of this mess), but as it happened, I dug further.

I started looking for incidents in cemeteries FARTHER from Morning Gate. It took a bit of time, but I eventually found it. It was a small string of headlines from another town's news site that was listed as a series of posts on a tabloid website. It was titled **"Terror of the Dallas N.C. Body-Snatchers"**, and it detailed a string of incidents where bodies in the cemeteries were found missing. Photos were posted of graves either left uncovered or being sloppily re-covered.

The post stated that Police investigated the cases for almost a year, even apprehending a few suspects. But supposedly, each of them had airtight alibis that cleared them and with no other leads, as well as little to basically no kind of concrete evidence to anyone else, they eventually had to pack it up and declare the cases "Cold". And, as you can imagine, no trace or leads were ever seen or heard from about the missing bodies since. 

I felt sick to my stomach. Looking at the date of the last article, I realized that it was only about a year and a half before the ads for "NuFaCe" started cropping up here in town. I couldn't believe it, but there it was, clear as goddamned crystal; this product is made out of dead bodies! That was when an all new wave of terror shook through me. 

Thinking again of what Keith said in the convenience store, I realized that whoever these sick, twisted fuck heads were, they weren't picky about how long the specimen had *actually* been dead before using it. Granger wasn't dead, until they got to him. In other words, these people weren't limited to grave robbing for this, they were apparently killers as well. 

That's why I have to leave. I've spent the past few nights packing what I can and finding somewhere I can stay in the next town over. I've put in my two weeks notice at the convenience store as well, even though, once I'm done with this, I'm gonna be well on my way out of Pinebrook and not looking back. 

I'll leave you with this, I don't know how much longer it'll be before "NuFaCe" or possibly some other fucked up by-product made by whoever these psychos are ends up expanding their market outside of Pinebrook, but it will. I just hope that when it does, I'll be far away and people will know. As well as this, I hope that no one sees my face again. I'm afraid there'd be a chance they'd find me, and that it might not actually be *ME* wearing it...

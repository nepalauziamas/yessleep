Following the advice given to me on Part 2 of this whole affair, I decided to search the database for any record of a Miss Thelma Denise Gabriel. I didn't actually find anything useful though, which actually kind of fits given what I read in this particular diary entry.

It's the weirdest one too. And honestly? It leaves me with a lot more questions than answers in regard to what happened to her and her whereabouts today. And I STILL don't know who planted the damn thing in my backyard!

I only managed to find one credible source - a 78 year old woman named Polly Adeena. She was born in 1944, meaning she would have been old enough to be Thelma's big sister, and her maiden name was Polly Gabriel.

I started to suspect the diary may have been real when I found out about her, but I figured her name could have just been a coincidence. Mrs Adeena is currently homebound, and being looked after by her 32 year old daughter, Carolyn Adeena, who, as you can tell, she had rather late in life.

Of course, I couldn't do this as an official police questioning, no matter how much I wanted to, so I simply dressed in casual clothes and asked Carolyn some questions 'as a neighbor', as Polly apparently could not talk very well. The conversation didn't last long anyway. I jotted everything down on a notepad when I got home, which is how I remember it went as follows:

Me: Oh, hey! You're Carolyn Adeena, right?

Carolyn: That's what they tell me. \*laughs\*

Me: I'm Crystal Locks. I recently moved in, and-

Carolyn: Yeah, I know. You're that new police officer lady, right?

Me: You already know me?

Carolyn: Oh, I know a lot of people in this town.

Me: Oh, that's nice.

Carolyn: So what seems to be the problem, officer? \*laughs\*

Me: Actually, there is no problem. This isn't even anything to do with legalities, or anything to do with the department at all. I was just curious if you knew anything about a Thelma Denise Gabriel?

Carolyn: ... Where did you get that name?

Me: Funny story, actually. I found a diary in my backyard that belonged to someone of that name, and I was just curious - as a neighbor - if you knew anyone with that name who used to live in town?

Carolyn: \*sweating\* No...can't say I do.

Me: Okay then, goodbye!

Carolyn: Goodbye!

As I was leaving, I turned to shut the door, and Carolyn slammed it in my face. She seemed in a hurry to make me leave.

I'm more than a bit suspicious of her, but I don't think the rest of the force would consider a possibly fake diary and a nervous woman as worrying or substantial enough to start an official investigation.

But enough with my ramblings. Let's get onto the final entry.

*November 9, 1961 (I think?)*

*Well, something incredibly odd has happened. I decided to take this diary with me in order to record what it's like to move into the sky - and it's very strange.*

*After I was supposed to go to bed tonight, I got dressed in my favourite red outfit and snuck out into the backyard with this diary, closed my eyes, and wished I was with the stars - and I could breathe. I learned in school that people can't normally breathe up there.*

*When I opened my eyes, I was floating in a giant black place with stars all around me, with my diary and pencil floating near me. It wasn't like what I imagined at all. I even tried talking to the stars around me, but my voice didn't make any sound. So I wished for a door that would lead to a better realm, exactly like how I imagined. And a purple door appeared next to me, floating in the blackness. I opened it and pulled myself in, and suddenly I wasn't floating anymore. I was in a giant playground, and the sky above me was still black, but it was covered with stars and I could walk normally now. I shut the door.*

*And I can talk to the stars too! I'm not sure how, but I've already played with them today. Plus, if I get bored of them, I can just wish them out of existence like I did with all those people!*

*I've already erased myself on Earth, but after I finish writing this I'm going to wish my diary back into our town. Maybe someone will find it and start praying to me like I wanted!*

*Well, actually, I've erased everything but Susan. I like her too much. She's not alive anymore, though. My only remaining wish is that Violet was here, but I guess I'll let her be back in Blackthorne. That's the name of the town I used to live in.*

*So I guess I'll spend the rest of my life here. Also, before I left, I stopped Momma and Daddy's hearts too. I hate Polly, but that doesn't mean I want her to put up with stupid parents telling her what to do for the rest of her life.*

*Also, using my powers I can still observe Blackthorne from here in a mirror next to one of the slides. Maybe I can visit too!*

*Goodbye diary, and hello whoever finds this in the future!*

*-Thelma Denise Gabriel*

I started to wonder if that's how the thing ended up in my backyard - she wished it there. But then again, if this really happened, it happened in 1961, and I was born in 1995. Thelma, if she existed, was born in 1954.

Then again, she did say 'in the future.' But that could just be a way of speaking.

Anyway, even though the diary is over, what with Polly Adeena and her daughter and the diary mysteriously turning up in my backyard and Carolyn's nervousness, I get the feeling this whole thing with Thelma is far from completely over and done with.

And besides, the diary isn't the only questionable and possibly-supernatural thing I've seen in this town as of late. I'm starting to take back what I said in previous posts about this town being normal. I will not go into further detail, as I believe these other things are other people's stories to tell, but I can say that this town makes me more nervous as the days go by.

Maybe other people will post their own experiences on here, just like I did. Maybe this isn’t the end, but rather a ‘to be continued’.

And overall...

**I think not just Thelma's story, but** ***Blackthorne's*** **story, is far from over.**

Let me begin by saying [that](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSW2vNo_5r_OQovvQqqDckXs0vwDPzB3Ea15A&usqp=CAU) my several years at **\[REDACTED\]** have been truly fulfilling! Since my first day, I’ve only looked forward to the next, hoping there were more ways I could help keep the company growing. My strict but fair manager, **\[REDACTED\]** has been supportive and honest with me about my workload and the compensation thereof. I foolishly attempted to ask for a raise years before I knew my role. I was immediately [reprimanded](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTK4luuYxKnip53XWAIRTyZqiN2OCrixMTzQQ&usqp=CAU) for the company time I wasted and including the time for the disciplinary action that I brought upon myself. It was a great learning experience! I could not have been corrected without it.

Today I begin my 25th year of ~~obedience~~ employment and am very proud to give my mandatory acceptance speech. The rewards I will be given, which I have agreed to as ‘fair’ on my HR’s behalf, include the following: A voucher for half-off any (1) item from the company cafeteria’s ‘soon to expire perishables’ section, (2) discounted re-used company attire uniforms, and a single ten-hour vacation day (to be used in the break room; subject to be on-call). My requests for the use of a personal fan and to have the fluorescent light fixed over my cubicle were denied. I accept that and the resulting disciplinary action scheduled for next week.

What a ride it has been! Every day as busy as the last and no different from the first. I can’t wait to see what is in store for me for the next 25 years. My “disobedient will to distract myself and others”, as diagnosed by the company-provided medical professional (terms and conditions may apply) Dr. **\[REDACTED\]**, I might hope for something new, more pay, or a sense of personal fulfillment. But I understand and agree that I will be happy with what I get!

Luckily, my thoughts are just that. [Thoughts](https://bestclassicbands.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Theyre-Coming-to-Take-Me-Away.jpg). I know to keep my head down and look to the future because when the company succeeds, we ALL ~~scream~~ SUCCEED! I would like to thank my company-approved “work friend” in cubicle 94-B of section LL, **\[REDACTED\]** (deceased), for always being there for me during our 5-minute quarterly breaks. And to my former intern and trainee, **\[REDACTED\]** (missing) for reading to me one of the many 15 company-approved ~~they fucking killed him~~ jokes during our gracious 4 minute lunch break. I was instructed to clear my cubicle out last Friday ~~because I’m getting old,~~ because when I return Monday, ~~and I’m not as productive anymore~~ I’ll have a new position waiting for me!

I just know my superiors are [looking out for me](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51548f02e4b0cc565007cbd8/1632957495772-J9QLTQXSIHU97JU0F60X/646B039C-EB32-4462-BED0-F3888339BB3D.jpeg?format=2500w), so I know they’ll make sure I’m taken care of!

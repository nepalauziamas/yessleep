  

I went up the stairs, unable to stop myself from glancing out of the odd little window set into the wall by the staircase, over into the garden.

Yes, Aidan was there. Swinging from the thick fat branch of the beautiful oak tree at the bottom of the garden. Through the thick glass of the old-fashioned window, I couldn’t quite make out his features, but the morning sun was glinting on the buckle of the belt he had used, stretched out behind him. He was wearing skinny ripped jeans just like the ones my youngest son had begged for recently. God there had been so much agonizing over those damn torn jeans- are all families like that? Are ripped skinny jeans really “gay”?

I sighed, but I didn’t stop my climb- there was too much to do.

I started on the bathrooms. With three teenage boys plus my husband, bathrooms are a daily, if not twice daily chore. Soon I forgot about Aidan in my growing frustration and fatigue.

But I was reminded of him again as I glimpsed him on the way down. And again on the way up. I go up and down those stairs twenty times a day, in my effort to “keep up with the house”. He’s there, every single time. 

I could only see him from the staircase window. From all the other windows facing the garden, everything was as it should be. A large garden, as typical as you would expect to find in picket-fence suburbia-land, with a couple of older trees set right at the back, just before the street. 

We knew, of course. 

I mean, everybody knew that a teenager had hanged himself from the oak tree following some dumb family quarrel- it had happened quite recently. I guess we were that typical stupid white family at the beginning of a horror movie, rushing merrily into a haunted house when everybody knows it’s haunted and we shouldn’t go in. But we honestly were at the end of our tether. We were desperate for a larger place- we were imploding in the old small place- the boys and my husband about to kill each other almost every day, and with property prices the way they had become, this was the only thing we could afford. 

My husband had joked darkly about it “Thank you Aidan”, he’d muttered, signing the papers. The recent suicide had driven the price down to our range- although not as much as you would expect. I elbowed him- “stop it Jason! That’s mean!” But I couldn’t help a giggle myself. Things would be so much better in a larger space, I told myself. The daily fights would simmer down. All the boys needed was some extra space. I had figured without the extra work.

Then, I started seeing Aidan swinging on the branch. I stopped giggling then, I can tell you.

I saw him the very first time I was alone in the house, after the boys had left for school and Jason to work. I had started on the daily chores, tidying up the breakfast table before picking up their random items flung around and starting to carry them up. I had given up the losing battle of trying to make everyone pick up their own stuff- once Jason got involved, the fall-out simply wasn’t worth it, and I had learned that for the sake of family peace, I need to keep quiet and just get on with it. 

Anyway, I glanced out, and there he was. I knew immediately who and what it was, and so oddly enough, I didn’t feel scared, especially once I realised I couldn’t see him from the other windows or when I actually went out in the garden. Just very upset.  

And even the upset faded as I went up and down the stairs all day, doing what needed to be done. I kept my mouth shut of course- what were we supposed to do? 

It must have been close to six weeks after our move. I still couldn’t help looking out of the window every time, and yes, Aidan was still there. Every time. 

This time was no different. The pause, the short unwilling glance from under my eyelashes.

And then I froze. Adam, my youngest, was standing next to Aidan. A kitchen chair was next to him, with a belt coiled on the seat. My heart dropped – I can still remember the physical feeling and the realisation at the back of my mind “oh this is what novelists mean when they write about hearts falling”

I had assumed none of the others could see Aidan, because no one had mentioned anything. It never occurred to me that they might have seen him, and like me, had chosen to keep quiet. 

Realising how terribly wrong I had been, I dropped everything I was carrying and rushed into the garden. “Adam!” I screamed. He was already standing on the chair, the belt looped around the branch, right next to Aidan. Yes, only now for the first time, I could see Aidan not through the stairs window, as I ran down the garden. 

I seemed to be running and screaming in slow motion. Adam took no notice of me, but Aidan twisted around and looked straight at me. As I drew nearer, I saw his distorted features clearly, his eyes were open and burning with despair and the desire to draw others in with him. He raised his arms, as if to push me back, and lashed out at me with his whole body and legs. 

Adam paused as he stood on the chair, hesitant to kick it away. The belt was coiled round his neck- I recognized it as one of Jason’s belt and a harsh sob escaped me. The two boys looked at me, and somehow my mind gave way, unable to distinguish which one was dead and which one was about to be. Aidan raised his legs again, this time kicking sideways, aiming for the chair. The chair toppled unsteadily and I threw my whole body on to it, willing it to be still and steady. I clasped Adam’s legs. I could feel ghostly blows on my back, but I didn’t care. 

Adam wasn’t struggling against me. 

I can’t remember how long we stayed in that position. But then there came a moment when we knew it was over, Adam was safe, and Aidan had to leave our garden. I slowly got up, and helped Adam down, unbuckling Jason’s belt with steady hands. I knew I wasn’t scared, and would never be. 

After Adam was safe, together, we carefully unbuckled Aidan, and lay him down on the grass beneath the oak tree. Then we left him to find his own peace, and walked back together to the house. When we looked through the staircase window, he wasn’t there.

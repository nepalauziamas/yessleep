It was the summer holidays, I was only 7 at the time and experienced something weird on my flight.

Waking up at 2am, I saw my mom was rushing to wake me up (Just like usual) but this time it was different.

"Wake up Velislav, wake up!" She whispered to me in a hushed tone. I was so tired I felt like I was floating.
She shook me awake and told me to quickly pack my luggage, of else we will be late for the flight.

We are never late for flights. All becuase mom makes sure to set an alarm in each room of the house and wake up my entire family. So that's why everyone was staring down at me, already awoken by my moms presence.

So, doing what I would usually do, I sat up, rubbed my eyes, and set off to brush my teeth while my mom prepared my luggage.

As I brushed my teeth, everything went normal until my mom knocked on the door loudly.

"VELISLAV, WE HAVE NO TIME, GET OUT OF THE BATHROOM THIS SECOND!" my mom yelled.

I was startled, who wouldn't be? My mom always makes sure I'm as energized as I would be on 2pm on 2am.

Anyway, I rushed out, still toothpaste in my mouth, and starting changing into my clothes. I was still in PJ's.

Going onto putting my shoes on, I realised the toothpaste was still in my mouth. So I went to spit it out in the kitchen sink. Everything seems normal so far right? Right... Well later on you would see how messed up this story comes to be.

Climbing into the car with my brother I realised my step-sister wasn't there,

"Mom! where's Teddy?" I asked.

She seemed puzzled, everyone did, they all looked at me  as if I was wild.

They weren't wrong, she had gone to her granny's house on holiday. So, as everyone else would do, I let out and enthusiastic "Ohhhhhhhhhhh!" To let them know I understanded that I forgot about her.

Arriving at the airport, I noticed it was ghosted. It was completely empty, like actually empt toy. No furniture, No ticket registers, no nothing. Kind of like the backrooms, there was only buzzing lights and a couple neon sign telling you where gates 10-60 were.

My family were all puzzled. Logically, we all ran to gate 48, and took our flight. Even though there was not one soul on the property, we didn't hesitate and boarded.

As I heard the voiceover of the flight attendant, I let out a sigh of relief, at least there is a pilot and flight attendant. Plane took off and we were off to our destination. An hour into the flight, it started raining,

Rain makes me sleep, like an automatic lullaby, it would put me to sleep, but not today.

I blinked.

Next thing you know is that the plane is already on the taxi lane and everybody was departing. Did I just time travel?

It felt like I actually slept, but it was on fast forward.

Has anything similar happened to you?

Becuase deep down I feel like I'm not the only one on the cabin that experienced this. Since everyone seemed brainwashed.

After climbing mountain for almost like 2hr we saw a **cave entrance we decided to stop there to rest we saw that the cave was deep and long and was getting darker and darker** it was suspicious how the cave  wasn't on M0nt climbing MAP suddenly my first friend alam, said "lets explore this cave, this is probably newly created cave, maybe we can find some rare rocks in there imagine..."

me and my second friend Lee, both nods turned on flashlights set and camp and started goin inside

we kept walking, kept walking and kept walking

"how long has it been, its weird we have been walking for so long and this way just doesn't want to take a turn" said Lee, I suddenly felt a cold wind on my cheeks don't know what it was i stopped to create tracking mark and looked behind and saw that the path was locked there was a wall "WHERE IS THE PATH?" i shouted they both suddenly looked behind and confusey Alam said "We..came from that direction right?" - "How in the world is it possible there was no sound only dead silent how did the path just disappeared out of thin air?"

i tried to check the wall thinking it might be a hallucination or something but it was a real wall like there was no path there we decided to keep going forward suddenly **i smelled the smell of rotten flesh it was the most disgusting smell i ever smelled i vomited i saw that my vomit was red**.... yes it was my **blood** "didn't... you smell it?" i said but when i looked behind my friends weren't there my eyes widened "**ALAM LEE WHERE ARE YOU?**" i shouted no response as expected..... i decided i will keep going forward towards that disgusting rotten flesh smell

my heart was racing my legs were trembling my hands were almost numb i was feeling feared..... scared i kept walking it feels like i was walking for hours but then i was a foot i didn't wanted to believe it, i hold myself together and walked towards the leg yeah it was a corpse i took a deep breath and just before i was about to see its head i saw another corpse my breath were heavy i saw the first corpse face.... it was ALAM and the otherone was LEE i was shocked i fell on ground

suddenly i heard a whisper in my hear to frightening to hear the whisper it - it was speaking some unknown language my heart was racing and then an unknown figure showed up his foots' nails were pitch black but were covered in red color no wonder it was.... blood it walked towards me slowly slowly as soon as i saw its full body shape i was frightened my breath were heavy and temperature felt like it was cold i couldn't stand up i started enchanting holy enchantments but it wasn't stopping  "***HOW CAN IT MOVE IS IS A DEMON WHY AREN'T THEY WORKING"*** i thought and then it stopped and gave the dead smirk like it could read my mind and then i heard a whisper "do... you believe.... you can... stop me?"

i couldn't feel my heart my body or anything but then i said "you... are a demon..." but then it started laughing slowly slowly and then replied through whisper **"demon.... God.... angel... devil... i am all of them.... I AM the one that you worship i am the one that kills you there is no hell no heaven.... its only me...**" and then the cave disappeared i saw everything - everything history of humans evolutions and how it have been watching us this whole time i was it all happening before my eyes....

"there...never...was a god... you were created...born...just like me...but you couldn't..." it whispered... i asked "what do you want?" - "why did you kill them?" and then another whisper with cold air passed through my ear said "you..." it replied "me why me? what do you want from me?" i asked

"...You will ...tell the world about...my existence" it SAID with blood drooling from its mouth i was at my home suddenly as i blinked i heard a whisper "......You have onee...day.." i contacted all my friends relative said i was going to die but they all kept asking me what happened i said i don't have any time left i told them where i am and that i will be dead by the time they reach here and spend my leftover time writing this.

It wanted to say to the world that it exists that it is the one we have been calling GOD...DEMON...ANGELS and it wanted to let the world to know that it exists and sees all of it there is nothing wrong or right in this world... by the time you are reading this i will be dead

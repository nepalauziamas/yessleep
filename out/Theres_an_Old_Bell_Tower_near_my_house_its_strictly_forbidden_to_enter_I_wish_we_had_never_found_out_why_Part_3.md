Part 3.

We were frozen in our place for a long time while Liam just... just stared at us.

He seemed hazy, he didn't look solid, more like some kind of shimmering apparition.

We were too scared to move a muscle.

The candle light danced and flickered, illuminating that thing using Liam's face to mock us.

He hunched over and blew the candle out.

When the flame died, he was completely swallowed by the darkness, like he had vanished.

The door slowly closed as we watched in complete awe.

There was a thick atmosphere of terror and confusion amongst the group.

After the door closed we still stood exactly as we were.

It was another long time before anyone even felt brave enough even to breathe let alone move.

Someone took a step back, soon all of us took a couple of steps back.

'Still think we're lying?' I said shaking my head, mostly directed at Shawn.

'So what!, your friend Liam's in there, why don't you go and get him then.' Shawn snapped back, 'You guys obviously had this all planned or something.' 

'Shawn, trust me, that's not Liam! This is how it all started before.' Brian said moving towards the door. 

'We should just leave I think', Ash suggested.

'No fuck that, this is all bullshit, it's all just stupid stories! they've told him to sit there to try and scare us!' Shawn blurted out seemingly in some sort of rage.

'Shawn... listen to yourself! You're saying our friend who has been missing for 5 years just popped up so we could all play a prank on you!? Are you out of your bloody mind??' I couldn't believe what I was hearing.

'Whatever!, I'm not leaving, you're all full of shit!' He exclaimed before heading back to the door, 'I'll go into that room and prove that it's him, and he's been hiding in here'.

'You're insane man, you literally insane!' Brian said, 'come on, whoever's leaving with me, let's go!'.

Myself, Brian and Ash began walking to the stairs.

Dennis hung around looking at Shawn.

'Come on Shawn, let's go man' Dennis said with his hand on Shawn's back.

'You can go if you want mate, I'm gonna look around a bit more', Shawn began walking over to the room where we saw Liam.

Dennis shook his head and turned to us as we waited, 'I can't leave him here himself', He looked genuinely worried. 

We turned and continued down the stairs, I could see Shawn trying to barge the room door open before he was eventually out of sight.

Ash and Brian were muttering to each other, I couldn't hear what they were saying as I was listening for anything unusual coming from up the stairs.

As we got to the ladder, Ash was having second thoughts about leaving anyone behind, whatever Brian had been telling him had obviously shaken him up.

'We should probably get them' he said.

Brian looked at me, then Ash, 'look man, Me and Danny have been through a lot in here, we came to see if we could get Liam back and I feel like it's pretty obvious that isn't happening, I'm not going back, if you want to go, then go! I'm going home, I'm sorry man'.

I looked at Brian, I was honestly torn, we had already left someone behind, and I wasn't sure if I was ready to carry that guilt for anyone else.

'Danny?' Ash looked to me for someone to go with him.

'I.... I don't know Ash, there's two of them there, he isn't alone... but... I really think if we are going back we should all stick together'. I shrugged, I was struggling to make any kind of decision.

It was already a bad thing that we had let someone out of our sight, I already felt like if we did go back, I wouldn't be able to trust either of them.

We were startled by a crashing sound from above, a horrible hissing and intermittent screams for help, we could hear a scuffle and things being thrown around.

We all looked at each other, terrified.

'We need to just get out of here, there's nothing we can do!' Brian said, ready to get down onto the ladder.

Ash began running up the stairs.

'Ash wait!!' I called to him, 'Brian, we can't let him go up alone.

Brian looked down to potential safety, then back up to Ash who was mindlessly running into potential danger, 'fuck sake Danny!' He said as he climbed back to his feet.

We ran to meet Ash at the top of the stairway, he had stopped dead in his tracks.

Dennis was on the landing stumbling towards us muttering to himself, he was covered in dirt and didn't seem to even notice we were there.

'Dennis!' Ash said.

He looked up and saw Ash right in front of him.

'Don't' Dennis mumbled as he continued staggering towards the stairs.

'Dennis, wait there!' Ash called to him again.

He was approaching me and Brian, I looked into his eyes. 

His face was bruised and beaten. His eyes seemed normal, not that it convinced me this really was Dennis, I cautiously put my hand out and steadied him.

'Dennis, it's us!' I said to him reassuringly.

He started crying like a five year old who just fell off his bike.

'Dennis what happened? Where's Shawn?' Brian asked.

Dennis sobbed and fell to the floor. 'It's got him, he fell inside the doorway and it closed, all I could hear was him screaming, then something grabbed me and started smashing me into a wall, the next thing I remember was Ash saying my name, I don't even know how I got down here.

I was dubious about the whole situation, I looked at Dennis with skepticism, Ash was already over picking him up but I just wasn't ready to believe anything he said right away, I could tell Brian was the same.

Screaming and shouting from above filled the entire area, we heard banging and Shawn shouting for Dennis to come back.

Ash looked at me, horrified.

'We need to go, no fucking around, we need to go and just try and get him' I pulled a knife out the bag and gave the other one to Brian, 'Ash, just help Dennis to walk if he needs, Me and Brian will go first'.

'I'll be okay, let's just go and get him' Dennis said.

I narrowed my eyes at Dennis, his eagerness to go back upstairs didn't sit well with me.

Brian and I turned to head for the stairs, I whispered to Brian, 'if he makes any strange moves, I'm stabbing him in the neck and running for my life, I'm not joking man, I dont trust this'.

Brian just nodded in agreement as we began to ascend.

When we reached the landing, the screaming stopped, but the door to the room Shawn was in was opening and slamming shut continuously.

Dennis and Ash were only a few steps behind.

I pulled out the torch and switched it on, it shone over to the rapidly slamming door, every time it opened I could see a crooked, opaque face, low down, staring back at us, gaunt with deep black eyes.

After a few seconds of the torchlight on the door, it shut, and stayed shut.

'What do we do?' Ash asked.

'I don't know Ash, I don't necessarily want to go over there but Dennis said that's where Shawn is! So I'm assuming that's where we need to go!?' I snapped back, feeling pretty pissed off that we had to come back because Shawn wanted to act like a big hard man.

The four of us crept onto the landing, I had the bigger of the two knives held out in one hand in front of me and my torch in the other.

I went first, the others quietly kept close.

The door opened a crack when I got to within 2 feet of it.

'They're coming' I heard a whisper say in a crackled voice.

Who 'they' were wasn't abundantly clear, did it mean us, as in we were coming to the room? Or was it a warning that something else would be coming for us?.

I directed my torch into the small opening.

Black, pointed fingers slid back inside into the darkness.

I closed my eyes.

I raised my boot and kicked the door open with such force, anything behind it was getting a large dose of wood to the face.

The door swung open with such ease, in contrast to how impossible it seemed to open earlier, or even the last time we were here.

I swung and stabbed the knife indiscriminately in and around the opening. 

Nobody else made a sound.

When I opened my eyes, my torch lit the room and we found nobody inside.

Brian gave a light shove to my shoulder, urging me to keep going.

We carefully entered the room.

I had never seen behind this door, so everything was as new to me as it was to Ash and Dennis.

There were barred windows, broken wooden beds with shackles cemented into the walls and floor near each one.

The floor felt almost sticky, some kind of tar like substance had been intentionally spilled all around making weird shapes on the ground, a stone circled fire pit sat in the center and there were  crude drawings and symbols lining the walls.

The smell was unbearable, I choked, I had to leave, the others were not far behind.

'What was all that shit?' Ash asked, coughing as he spoke.

'No idea man, let's just not go in there again though' I said, catching my breath.

Dennis seemed okay, which drew a little more suspicion on him... from Me and Brian at least.

I could see Brian glancing at him every now and then, I was reluctant to take my eyes off him myself.

We looked up the stairs, it led to the fourth floor, I didn't want to go any higher but it looked like we had to, if anything I didn't want to reach those bells again.

Dennis and Ash had already started climbing the stairs, I looked at my knife, I looked at Brian.

We both followed, keeping a few steps behind.

I almost fell down the stairs when the door to the room we were just in slammed shut. 

Ash whimpered, 'I don't like this, I want to get out of here!'.

'We all do, Ash, just make sure we stick together and we'll make it'. I said to him, trying to calm him down.

We approached the fourth landing, to the right I saw the door to our 'base room', it was slightly ajar.

'Brian, that's the safe room we were in last time, we should go in there' I flashed the torch over to the door.

'I forgot about that' he said, 'everybody head in there!' Brian commanded, pushing past Ash and Dennis.

Entering that room again, it felt exactly as it did before, safe, comforting, I dont know why but this room seemed completely detached from the rest of the building.

The old cabinets and broken ancient furniture still sat where we left them.

I made my way to the window and I looked out, this time it wasn't sadness I felt looking outside, it was determination, I was determined to get us all out of here alive.

As I looked out, the wind was brushing the trees, I could almost smell the fresh air, as I gazed up to the moon and the stars above, I began to wonder.... 

Why the fuck were the moon and the stars out?

It couldn't have been any later the 2 or 3pm.

'Uhm! Guys!?' I started, glaring with confusion at the darkened forest surrounding us, nobody noticed, they were all looking around and chatting amongst themselves.

'GUYS!' I called again.

I turned to see everyone stop what they were doing and look over to me.

Not one of them seemed shocked.

'Doesn't anybody see anything wrong here?' I asked, bewildered by the fact that still, none of them had any idea what I was talking about.

'Look!' I pointed out the window.

They all looked at me like I was insane.

'Oh my God' I put my hand on my face, 'Brian, what time is it?'.

He twigged straight away, I saw the second his mind had put it together, his jaw dropped, 'what the fuck? How long have we been in here for?'

Ash and Dennis looked equally shocked as they realised.

'I dont know, 2 hours max I'd say' Ash said.

The wind outside began to howl.

I looked out again, absolutely dumbfounded at what I was looking at.

Bumps and scraping noises accompanied the howling wind, the window seemed to rattle in it's frame.

Something stirred inside the room.

One of the smaller cabinets started to shake, getting progressively more violent, we all took a few steps back and huddled together.

Then it stopped.

The soft click of a latch broke the silence, and the cabinet door creaked open.

Liam's head poked out of the partially open door.

'Come and look at this' he said, as his face disappeared back inside.

We stood silent.

'Just head for the door' I said to everyone.

We inched to the side, never taking out eyes off the cabinet in front of us.

Another click of a door opening behind us.

We all turned in unison, a cupboard door had opened only about an inch.

A hand began to emerge, sliding along the other door that was still closed.

Long pointed fingers tapped and scraped the old wood as they danced along the cabinet door, the arm began to stretch out, quickly getting longer and longer as it made it's way to the door to the landing.

We kept moving, taking small but quick steps, we made it to the door first.

The cupboard door burst open as we began to exit the room, the tall black figure was crouching inside.

It looked right up at us, directly into my eyes, it's gaze burned.

The creature let out a scream and in an instant, darted towards us.

We all hurried out and pulled the door shut, loud banging came from the other side as the door rattled and cracked.

We held it shut with everything we had.

'We need to go somewhere, we need to run, just run down the stairs!' I cried out. 

On the count of three we let go and ran for the stairs to head down.

As we got to the stairway, we could see, at the bottom, slowly crawling up each step was the same contorted, jagged black figure, smiling and laughing at us as it's hands and feet appeared to scorch and crumble the stone beneath it.

We were once again frozen in fear as the beast slowly got closer.

We only had one other way to run...

Up!

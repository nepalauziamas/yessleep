So idk where to start, but I guess I say that I’ve been  aware of the supernatural and superstitions. Like I’ve heard about the dogmen, bigfoot, skinwalkers, and ghosts. I’ve had my own ghost experiences. But I didn’t think I would experience something that felt so evil that made my soul drop, and experience such a deep fear. And I won’t put any specific locations, except this experience happened to me in Southern California, other side of the Silverado Mountains.

So it was June 2021, I decided to go and spend the weekend at a close friend’s place to celebrate a birthday happening on Sunday. To get there you go down a 2 way street all the way to intersection to turn into neighborhood. My friend’s house is a pretty nice house. 2 stories, a pool, a big garage with a steel gate on the side of the house, with a downstairs bathroom next to the gate. The house is in a little neighborhood, with a large open plain and mountains in the area, where all stores are at least 15-20 minutes away.

I arrived at my friend’s house, on a Friday night, helped them set up on Saturday for the party for Sunday. The party was fun, had a good time and had some drinks going too. Around 10:30-11 pm, we decided to go see a movie at a drive-in theater about 30 minutes away. We go, my friend, his drunk older brother, and myself.

The movie finished around 2 am, and we headed back to the house. On the way we stopped at a gas station filled up the truck, and decided to make another stop at a Jack-in-the Box, cause we were all pretty hungry. So by the time we get to the house and pull into the driveway it’s about 2:45 am now.

We get out of the truck, there’s no breeze, no sound from crickets or birds, just the moon lighting up most of the surrounding area with some of the street lights. We then realized we forgot the keys to the house, so my friend decided to just unlock the garage to open the front door, and then I was helping his older brother out the truck and getting some stuff out as well. And this is where everything started to turn weird.

My friend turns to me and says, “Did you just hear that goat laugh?” As I’m helping his brother out of the truck. 

I replied, “What do you mean goat laugh?”

“I just heard a like a goat laugh right now. Like it was behind us”, my friend said. And we both turned around and looked around and looked down the street and nothing.

“It was probably nothing”, I said as I felt the some type of presence of us being watched from somewhere. “Lets just open the door, and take the stuff inside”.

So we get inside the house, and we bring our food in the kitchen and start eating. And I still feel a presence of being watched from now the backyard, which none of the lights were on back there so it was practically pitch black. I finish my food, check the time 3:00 am, and I go to use the bathroom. In the bathroom I felt uneasy, so I closed the little window in there to somewhat ease my anxiety. And 30 seconds after, I’m about to wash my hands when I hear something rattling the side gate, trying to open it, and it just sounded like something jumped over it. I quickly wash my hands, and tell my friends “Hey, it sounds like someone tried opening the side gate and maybe jumped over”.

We quickly turn out the back lights, grabbed a bat, a flashlight, and a knife. We go outside and nothing was there. We check the lock on the gate and then the side door to the garage, and we all looked at each other and immediately went inside to check the garage. We go in, my friend is checking around boxes on one side and I do the same on the other. I look up at the garage door cuz it has some little windows on the top of it, and I stood confused as I looked to see what was maybe a shadowy figure looking right back at me.

“Nothing, everything looks clear”, my friend says. As I look at him and look back at the window and nothing is there. We exit the garage and I tell my friends, “Yeah, I think I’m gonna get going now”. My friend walks me out and says something along the lines, of “I told there’s some weird shit out here, like there’s a lot of urban legends but drive safe and call me if you see anything on the way out”. I just said okay and good night, as I started my car, connected my phone to the charger as the screen lit up and read 3:13 am.

I started driving out the neighborhood and onto the 2 way street, no traffic, no street lights to light the way, and just 1 intersection to turn left for the freeway. In the car, I felt safe, until I hit the curvy part of the road. I felt something watching me, and I looked to the side of the road, and I saw it. And I’ve been in many situations and I’ve never been scared for my life cause I’ve had no reason to, I’m 6’2, 250lbs, but one look and all the hair on my neck stood up, my heart dropped into my stomach, and I felt like my soul was being pierced with those eyes.

The eyes are something I can’t get out of my mind, that thing had 2 eyes that glowed a deep shade of amber, and silhouette of this thing made it to be at least 7ft tall. My eyes were just locked onto this thing, and I heard a voice inside my head go off and yell “GO!”, and I hit the gas so hard. I started praying every pray I could and quote protection scripture from the Bible as I drove away. My body was tense with fear, I felt a few tears stream down my face, and I snapped myself out of it cuz I realized I was going almost 100mph and my turn was coming up.

Once on the freeway I called my friend told him what happened, and he knew from the tone in my voice that I saw something that freaked me the hell out. We hung up as soon as I got home, and a drive that would normally take 35 minutes I did in about 20. I ran inside and buried myself in my room and prayed. I didn’t realize what time it was until I saw the sunrise and I slowly dozed off. But every since that incident, I’ve been to that friends house 2 times since it. I always make sure I leave before the sunsets, and that I have a cross in the car to hope to never run into that thing again.

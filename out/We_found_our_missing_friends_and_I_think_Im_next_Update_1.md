[First Part](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/v1fa9t/we_found_our_missing_friends_and_i_think_im_next/)

I appreciate the concern a few kind people shown us on the first post so I thought I would follow through with an update.

After last night I ended up falling asleep. Part of me felt like it was a nightmare, not finding the bodies, that was too insane to have been a nightmare. The knocking on my door? That, felt like a nightmare and honestly if it was I would have felt a bit better about being at home. It's weird, it makes me feel like I was followed.

I did have a nightmare though. 

I was woken up from my sleep to the sound of the front door opening, I heard footsteps walking through my house, it sounded like more than one person. In this nightmare, I didn't get out of my bed, I just tried to not make a sound. I heard them approaching the bottom of the stairs, followed by the creaking of each step, one after the other. At this point they were outside my bedroom.

three knocks against my door, on the third the door began to slowly open and it was then, I saw them. Craig and Jack, the corpses of Craig and Jack. They had their heads placed back on their necks but you could see where they had been cut through, their faces were terrifying, milky eyes with drooping open mouths. I was completely frozen in terror, they then began to reach towards their heads, hands on their temples and slowly began to separate their heads from their bodies.

Then I woke up to a load of missed calls from Ross, I see he sent me a voice message on snapchat "Come to mine as soon as you get this" I was really worried so I got dressed as fast as possible and had the worst shower of my life, constantly afraid that the bathroom door would open and someone would walk in. I hopped in the car and began to drive through.

After heading through to his place he comes out and gets in my car, he starts yelling at me about how he thought something had happened to me and that I should have answered my phone instead of letting it ring out every time. I explained that I had a heavy sleep due to the fact that I was awake until around 5am before passing out. I was about to tell him about the knocking on my door before he cuts me off.

"Last night, there was a knock at my door, really late around 2am, I wasn't sure if it was you or not"

I explained that it wasn't me and he cut me off again.

"No, I know it wasn't you"

What he said next sent a chill down my spine and made me feel nauseas.

"The knocking started at the front door, it started in three's then into a continuous, never ending knock. Then while the front door was going the back door started going too, then the windows in the living room and the windows in the kitchen"

He described it to me as almost deafening, even though he was upstairs he said it made him feel claustrophobic. He said that this continued for around 2 minutes before stopping. Nothing, no footsteps, no voices or cars driving away. He stayed awake the entire night and heard absolutely nothing until I came to his place.

We drove back out in the daylight to find Craigs car. We couldn't find it, we were in the exact spot but there was no car, there were 4 dents in the ground from where the tyres would have been, there was even marks in the ground from where we walked up to, and around the car. It was nowhere to be seen, the ground looked like it hadn't been touched, no one moved the car but everything in the environment suggested that is exactly where the car was and that it was here for some length of time.

We were perplexed, no longer worried or scared, just totally confused. After looking around a bit, even though we knew it wasn't going to be anywhere else, we decided to get back in our car and head home.

we stopped halfway home and got something to eat, it was nice, getting a drive through meal and sitting in the parking lot eating, people all around us. We had a chat and it was apparent that neither of us wanted to go back to our own houses, I decided that we would stay at Rosses place, we're there now. 

Everything was fine, well I mean as fine as it could be, just talking and watching random YouTube videos together. To a degree things felt normal, it made me feel a bit guilty but then again it still doesn't feel real. Ross was telling me about how Jack and Craig were trying to call him today but he couldn't bring himself to answering and I don't blame him. We had a look on Facebook and found they're trying to organise a search party for Craig and now people are asking around about Jack. I wish Jack never went out on his own, I wish we followed Craig home and just called it a night.

As I say, everything felt okay, until the knocking started once again. It was around 2am but this time it was everything Ross described, the deafening knocking of every ground floor door and window, the handles all rattling as if someone's trying to get the doors open. The house felt as if it was vibrating, then it all stopped. It's been an hour and nothing.

We're going to take turns sleeping until its fairly bright out, apologies if any of the writing here isn't great, I'm writing this on my phone and Craigs number keeps trying to call me every couple of minutes. I'm going to turn my phone off now, I'll post an update tomorrow if I can. We have discussed potentially going somewhere else to get away from who or what is knocking on our doors and tormenting us, I just hope it stops.

Never accept an unknown number and here is why.

Years ago when I was in school 5 kids went missing, I got a text from an unknown number during lunch time, the next said.

"Come to the principals office"

I sent a text back and asked 

"who is this?"

I didn't get a reply but I figured I was overthinking the situation anyway so I left lunch to go to the principals office.

When i entered I say the principal just standing there doing nothing, I said to him 

"Hey, how did you get my number?"

No response.

I said again.

"Hello?"

No response again, I then asked if he was OK to which he never replied.

I heard the door lock behind me and I began to worry as my principal wasn't normally like this so I shouted

"Let me out!"

As I was shouting and pounding at the door the principal came up to me without me knowing and slammed my head on the door multiple times making me unconscious.

I woke up to the sound of this buzz, I looked at my surroundings confused as I was in a familiar place 

I stood up and my heart dropped as I realised where I was.. the backrooms.

I figured it was a dream as this place can't be real but the longer I was there the more real it seemed, I heard a creature roar in the distance and I began to run the other way as I didn't know what this creature was nor did I want to find out. 

While running I saw someone, Jack..  my best friend who went missing 2 weeks ago.

He saw me too and grabbed my hand and we ran together without saying a word to eachother.

After running for awhile we got to this small passage  and he went down it so I followed.

He had made a base in the backrooms. I asked how he got the food and he said he found a room that generates food every few hours.

We spoke for awhile about what happened to us both and how we ended up in the backrooms and it turns out the principal did the same to him.

We both said we need to escape to stop the principal so we decided to try escape the backrooms.

We packed alot of food and water from the place that generates it and we headed out to find an escape.

While looking for an escape a creature had found us and made a loud roar as it began to chase us.

We ran for what felt like forever until we came across a large drop. With water at the bottom. 

It was creepy and pitch black down there but we had to jump.

I was hesitant but this would get my best friend killed

He saw I was hesitant and pushed me but the small time it took for him to push me was enough time for the creature to reach my friend and stab him in the side before he could fall into the water with me.

He screamed as he fell down and while in the water I could hear muffled screaming.

I grabbed his hand and we swam to the surface and looked up at the drop we just came down and he was in alot of pain. 

While In pain he told me the other 4 kids that went missing were with him and they got attacked my the creature and he left them to survive while they got killed.

A light then appeared on the bottom of the water and we knew instantly it was an escape but it was guarded by another creature.

He looked at me and said

"I'm not running this time, escape for me." 

And then he swam down to fight the creature alone while injured.

I listened to him while also wanting to help him I knew we both couldn't survive and I looked at him while this sea creature killed him and swam through the exit.

When I got out I told the police a lie.

Something that would get the principal arrested but I didn't want to make them not believe me.

I told them about all the other kids deaths.
 
The principal got life in prison.

I was stuck in the backrooms for 2 days.

It's been 20 years since that event and I now have a family, today while working I got a message from a unknown number and it said 

"I'm coming for you" 

This made my heart drop so I searched the principal on Google something I haven't don't in years and saw...

He escaped prison..

He's coming for me..

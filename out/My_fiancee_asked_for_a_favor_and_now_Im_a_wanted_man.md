She was a diamond in the rough. Her lips were an enchanting rose color . My heart skipped a beat. She is my forever girl and  I was going to be her husband. That morning  I dropped off some breakfast at my fiance's apartment. It was only across the street from mine so it wasn’t all that bad. She is so beautiful . She has big brown curls and gorgeous chocolate eyes.  I walked across the street about 11 am.  I had to use the stairs because the elevator was broken so  I went to her apartment at about 12 and climbed 7 flights of stairs. Boy  I was so drained,  When  I walked into her apartment  I sat on her couch.  I heard her in the shower.  


I could only imagine what she looked like at that moment. Just the thought of her beautiful body being cleansed and her rush of anger if  I dare to take a peek.  I sat there waiting. She was stunning.   I gave her a big hug as she started to tell me about her day . She was so happy to see me. She started laughing hysterically.  I think  I said something funny but her laughs became so hysterical that she spat a little red spit on me.   She seemed embarrassed by the outburst “hey dont worry about that .um… I know it lookes bad but my doctor says there's nothing wrong”. . I just wiped it off and gave her a kiss on her forehead. I asked her “do you want to go to the hospital? It's just you haven’t been yourself lately.a second opinion wouldn’t hurt baby ”. “I'm fine I promise”She got dressed and layed on the bed. “hey can you get that handle on my dresser”. It looked like it belonged to some kinda blade. It  was a hardwood brown handle with a lion head carved into it. 


 I looked at her confused,“So what am I going to do with this?” “Come over, I found someone who had some kinda idea of what was going on and I was wanting your help with this” after she said that i was like “ ok so what do i have to do?” The lion carving looked farmiiar. “Ok” she started “ so at the end do you see that blue line you need to tap my belly first with that end and then everywhere I have the cramps” “ok but i want you to go to the hospital tomorrow ok i mean I’m sure you got this from what your superstitious granny” i say. “Yeah, are you going to help me or whatever?” she said alittle annoyed. “ ok so where do you want me to touch it too”      I left her to sleep and went to work at 1 o’clock. 


Later that day when  I went home 2 police officers were waiting for me.  They told me my fiance was murderd and they “know”  I did it but really  I think it's just some old hog working on a hunch. They tried to arrest me but I ran from them and now I'm here writing this on my work laptop at a Mcdonalds.

 

I loved my partner, she was my life. I did not kill Celsy lovac . She was the love of my life. She was found stabbed in her stomach , head , twice in the neck, and chest. I know her killer is still out ther but i dont know who. I think something is going on here but please stay safe and if you ever become in contact with the lion handle dont touch it.

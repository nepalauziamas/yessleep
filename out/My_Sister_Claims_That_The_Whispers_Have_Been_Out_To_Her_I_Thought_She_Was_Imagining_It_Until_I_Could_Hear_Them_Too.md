It started sometime last year, after the death of her husband. She started spiraling and she moved back home for support. She was the most outgoing person I’ve ever met but nowadays she could barely muster up the energy to come down to the kitchen and eat. 

About two months after she moved in, we were watching some tv show when the power went out. The scorching temperatures frequently caused power outages in the area, so we sat in complete silence for a couple of minutes. 

“Fuck.” She sighed before fully laying on the sofa. 

“Do you think we should light some candles?” I asked. 

“I might actually go to bed. I’m getting tired. Just make sure to blow out the candles before you go to sleep.” I nodded and went back to my phone until I fell asleep. 

I awoke in the morning to the sound of my sister cooking along with some video on YouTube. I glanced down at my phone to see that it was 5 am. 

“How early did you wake up?” I asked groggily. 

“Oh, I didn’t sleep.” 

“Why?” I questioned while serving myself some coffee that was brewing. I could see the bags under her eyes and her hair was all frizzled giving away her state of exhaustion. 

“I don’t know it was too quiet. I hate the silence.”

“Gotcha.”

“I think I have tinnitus or something. I can hear a little ringing noise and it’s annoying.”

“Maybe you should see a doctor about that.”

“Yeah maybe. I don’t have health insurance. 

“No worries. I’ll just give you the money. Just let me know when you make your appointment.” I replied. 


“Ok.” She answered quietly before going back to her cooking. We ate and made small talk before I went off for work. I didn’t want to put any pressure on her, but I found myself wondering when she would snap out of it and go back to work. 

Maybe work would make her feel better. 

I know it made me feel like a dick thinking these thoughts, but I just didn’t want her to go down the very same path our mother did. 

After her first husband died, she resorted to alcohol and had a bunch of kids she never cared for. Me and my sister bounced around foster homes until we turned 18 and moved in together. Then she met David and they were together for 4 years. 

Then David died. 

And now here I was trying to pick up the pieces of a grieving person. 

Once again. 

But Layla was different. She was ambitious and kind. She never yelled or screamed in her life as uptight as she was. She always followed a schedule and wrote things down onto little post-its that she put up on a calendar. 

Or at least I thought she was. 

Today I came back from work to see her sleeping in the couch, all curled up with a glass of wine spilling onto the sofa. I grabbed the glass and set a towel over her and began to clean up the mess. 

Then, I began to cook dinner for the both of us. 

I gently woke her up and set a plate on the coffee table in front of her and turned on the TV before sitting down myself. 

“Did you finish the bottle by yourself?” I quietly asked. 

“No, I think I spilled most of it. I must have fallen asleep. Sorry about that.” She sheepishly giggled and went back to eating her food. 

I didn’t want to rock the boat, so we continued to eat. 

“Did you schedule an appointment?”

“For what?” She asked raising her eyebrow curiously. 

“Doctors? For your tinnitus? Weren’t you- “She interrupted me before I could finish. 

“Oh. That? No, I think it went away. I’ll make an appointment tomorrow just in case though.” 

“Yeah no. I think that’s a good idea.” I agreed and we went back to eating while watching TV. 
Later that night, the power went out again while I was in the middle of typing out some stupid report and in frustration, I went to grab a glass of water. 

I passed my sisters room, and I could hear her blasting music from her cellphone. I shrugged it off and continued with my night. 

The next morning as I got ready for work, I could see her passed out in the living room couch with the television turned on. I sighed and put a blanket over her and continued with my day. 

This ritual went on for a week until I decided to ask her about it over dinner. 

“Hey, I thought you were like a light sleeper. I remember you would yell at me growing up whenever I slept through my alarms.”

“I still am. It’s just now my tinnitus is getting worse. I went to see the doctor about it and he basically said tough luck.” She replied sarcastically.

“He straight up said tough luck?” I probed. 

“Well, not in those exact words. He basically told me to get a white noise machine or noise canceling headphones.” 

We talked about where she should order those machines from and continued with. 

About a week later, I woke up from my sleep as if something had interrupted me, but I was so tired that I rolled over and tried to go back to my slumber. I was about to drift off when I heard a hushed voice. 

“No. Xavier’s gone. He’s not here.” It was Layla. 

“Go where?” She continued to speak loudly. 

I wondered who she was talking to but I chalked it up to her talking on the phone with a friend and rolled over and went back to sleep. 

I asked her about it the next day, but she got all fidgety and tried to play it off. 

“Hey, were you on the phone last night?”

“Uh no. Why?” 

“Really? I thought I heard you speak on the phone late last night.”

She gave me a funny look before going back to her breakfast. 
“I think you need to lay off the sugar. I remember it made you dream vividly as a child.” 

I rolled my eyes, but I didn’t think anything of it. 

The next night, I awoke to hear her speak once again and I rolled over and tried to go back to sleep. It was so hot that I decided to get up and get a glass of water and I ended up walking to the kitchen. I walked past Layla’s room and I swear I could hear whispers as if there were people in her room. 

I was a bit weirded out since it was well past midnight, but I thought maybe she had some friends over or something and I went off to bed. 

I asked her about it the next morning and once again she just feigned ignorance. 

“Did you have people over late last night?” I probed out of curiosity. 

“No? Why?”

“I swear I heard people in your room like around at 2 am.” 

“I wouldn’t have anyone over at 2 am.” She replied with a slight attitude. 

“Uh alright. Whatever don’t tell me.” I matched her energy. 

“I swear I’m telling the truth.” 

“I literally heard multiple whispers but whatever.”

“Fine, don’t believe me.” She replied snarky and we went off to do our own thing. 

We continued about our week, and I could see that she was getting more and more disheveled and I swear there were days where she refused to sleep. I finally decided to ask her about it one day during dinner and what she said disturbed me. 

“Are you ok?” I know David’s passing was tough on you but this isn’t healthy at all.” I tried to break my concern as gently as I could. 

“What? No, I’m fine.” She replied trying to avoid my gaze. 

“Don’t lie to me. Please. I’ve seen the bags under your eyes and there are times where it looks like you’re not all there. You can tell me anything and I wont judge. I’m just here because I care.” 

She tried to keep it together, but I could see the tears well up in her eyes. 

“I don’t know. I don’t know anymore. My tinnitus is getting worse, and I swear I can hear voices in them. Xavier, I know I’m not crazy, but I swear sometimes the voices get so loud that I can’t hear anything else. The voices are just so loud.” She full on broke down and she collapsed off her chair, just crying. 

I rushed forward and hugged her trying to provide some sort of comfort. She was my sister. She cared for me when our mother wouldn’t. I guess the mental toll from everything she went through was so heavy that her mental psyche broke. I just hushed her and told her that we would get her help. 

I was going to have to call a psychiatric institute or something before she hurt herself or resorted to drug use to cope. I was going to do everything it took to avoid her from heading down our mother’s path. 

Eventually she passed out from complete exhaustion, and I manage to carry her to her bed and I wrapped a blanket over her before going back to the kitchen to clean up. 

Once again later that night, I awoke to hear her yell and I ran towards her room. I was about to enter her room when I heard the whispers once again. 

“David wants you to come home.”

“David’s looking for you.”

“David misses you.”

“Help us bring David back.”

I pushed open the door to see something spine chilling.   

It was my sister all alone sitting in the middle of the floor sobbing to a mirror in the middle of the room. I got closer and her eyes were closed but she was crying hysterically as the whispers were getting louder and louder all around us. 

They were full on yelling by now. 

“David’s here!”

“David wants you to come home!”

“Layla! Layla! Layla wake up!” I shook her but she wasn’t waking up and in a panic I ran out into the kitchen and I grabbed a grill lighter. I ran back to the room and turned it on and placed it onto the skin of her arm causing her to jolt awake. She yelled in pain and shoved me backwards. 

“What the fuck?” She cried out. 

“Did you burn me? What the fuck are you doing?” 

“Me? You were scaring me. It was as if you were possessed and there were voices yelling all around us. You weren’t waking up at all and I had to resort to drastic measures.” I tried to explain but she got all quiet. 

“Holy fuck. Wait, you heard the voices too? I don’t get it. I thought I was just having a nightmare.” She seemed confused but equally scared as I was. 

Her face seemed horrified as she began to look behind me as if she was looking at something specific. My heart began to pound louder and louder as I slowly turned my head to see what she was looking at. 

There was a figure in the mirror, a little girl to be exact pushing her little hands onto the glass as if she was trying to get out. She stopped once she saw us and began to take a couple of steps back before motioning us to follow her, but we were both paralyzed in fear. 

I regained my courage and grabbed a candle near me and threw it towards the mirror, causing it to fall and shatter into a bunch of little fragments. At that exact moment, the lights in the hallway turned back on. 

I didn’t even realize there was another blackout. 

I think we sat there for a couple of minutes trying to recollect ourselves before I got up and motioned her to follow me. 

We walked towards the kitchen and turned on the lights. I didn’t know what else to do so I put on the kettle to make some tea. It was currently almost 4 in the morning. 

“That was probably something we both hallucinated.” I tried to explain it away in order to regain some sense of sanity. 

“No, it wasn’t, and you know it. You heard the voices too.”

“You said you heard voices before. How long exactly has that been going on?” I asked. 

“A couple months after David passed away. At first it was pleasant dreams where I would talk with him but after he began to convince me to join him, I began getting scared. Then he turned scary, and the nightmares started. Whenever I began to hear tinnitus in my ears, I knew I was in for a rough sleep that night. 

“I’m sorry for not believing you earlier. I really thought you were having a mental breakdown. “I apologized sincerely. 

“I don’t blame you. I wouldn’t believe me either.” 

“So, what do we do now? Call a priest or something? “I replied. 

“I don’t know. Maybe when you broke the mirror it stopped. The lights did turn back on when you did. Maybe it died along with the broken mirror.”

“I don’t know. I guess we find out tonight.” 

The day went by and we tried not to think about it too much but that fear was still lingering. I guess the lack of sleep from that night hit me because I didn’t notice that I had fallen asleep on the couch until the noise of a mosquito woke me up. 

I swatted it away before getting up groggily. 

My eyes adjusted and I swear I could see a figure leave the back entrance. 

“Layla?” I questioned. 

I jolted up and rushed out the backdoor and the figure was gone. 

“Layla!” I cried out but I couldn’t see much aside from a heavy fog and darkness. I ran towards Layla’s room and opened the door, but her bed was empty. I ran throughout the house calling out her name and trying to find her but she wasn’t home. 

I pulled out my phone and tried to call her but nothing. I panicked and thought of something. This specific phone had that app where you could find the missing phone. I quickly logged on to my laptop and pulled up the location. 

Shayatin’s peak. 

A mountain that was located about 4 hours away. How the fuck could she have gotten that far in that amount of time? 

I called the authorities and gave them the location, but they were useless as well. They lazily said she probably went hiking but they would send some officers up the mountain the check up on her. I didn’t tell them everything because I was scared that they would either think I was crazy, or we would both be punished for bringing about evil things. 

I couldn’t bear the thought of her being up there all alone so I grabbed my car and drove up there as fast as I could. I think I reached the mountain in under 2 hours as I was lucky that I wasn’t pulled over at all. 

Perks of living in a third world country, I guess. 

I pulled into the first road that I could see continued to drive trying to see if there was anything that could give me a sign of where she could be. 

The stupid app didn’t exactly tell me her exact coordinates and it wouldn’t matter anyways because the minute I pulled into the area; I lost complete service. 

I drove for about an hour before I could barely see anything due to a heavy fog. It was like the fucking fog followed me. I drove on the dirt road but then a figure ran across the path, and I tried to avoid it, but I ended up crashing into a tree. 

I hit my head hard and I felt dizzy for a bit, but I stumbled out of the car and grabbed an emergency bag I always kept in my trunk. 

The car had ended up near a muddy dirt path that had several footprints. It was as if a parade had walked through it. I decided to follow it and it must have been another hour before I reached the entrance of a large cave. 

The entrance seemed complete devoid of all light and sound, as if nothing should be entering it. I didn’t even want to enter it. There was a slight cold feeling as if the air itself was telling me to turn back. 

But for Layla, I decided to march forth. 

I continued to walk, and my flashlight started getting slightly dimmer but I came upon two paths. One that seemed to go down, and the other that seemed to go up. 

I thought the more reasonable one was to go up, so I decided to go down. This entire situation was already unusual. 

Eventually I reached the entrance of a room of some sort, and my flashlight decided to go out at that exact moment. I walked in pulled out a flare gun from my bag. 

I wish I added more batteries or something to the bag but I only added some bare essentials in case I ever got trapped in the middle of the road not hunting down a possessed sister. I didn’t want to use my phone battery just yet. 

I fired the flare gun up into the air and the minute the green flash went off, my heart stopped. Every hair on my body went up and it was like every fiber in my being was telling me to turn the other way and run. Run as far away as you can from this damn cave. 

I could see hundreds of still bodies just standing there. It was as if hundreds of people from all around the world had been plucked off the street and decided to come and just stare at a large arch at the center of the cave. 

It was unnerving. 

I wanted to yell out for Layla, but I was too scared that any sudden move and they would all snap out of it and come after me.  

But I had to get closer so I could find Layla. 

I turned back and decided to head down through the other tunnel when something caught my eye. It was like hieroglyphics or something. 

But what caught my eye was the main drawings. 

There was a bunch of little black figures holding knifes to their throat and blood gushing out of it. The blood looked like it was flying out of his neck and into the arch. 

To the left of the arch was a figure with a detailed face resembling a fucking white owl with black hair flowing down. 

I wasn’t sure what those fuckers wanted to bring out, but I wasn’t going to let my sister be apart of it. 

I continued on to the tunnel and I reached the entrance to the main center of the cave, where everyone was still there just standing so fucking still. I got so close to one of them and aimed my phone’s flashlight so close and I could swear they weren’t even fucking breathing. It was like they were statues, with their eyes just staring ahead blankly.  I started going through the group, trying hard not to touch them accidently but they were so tightly grouped up that I had to set down my bag so I could squeeze through. 

I continued to look for Layla when I heard footsteps climbing onto the platform in front of the arch. I looked ahead towards the source of the noise, and I saw a man hold up a sharp rock. He plunged it into his own throat and made a soft gurgling noise before collapsing onto floor. 

Call me a fucking coward but seeing the bright red blood gush out of his throat almost made me drop my phone. I wanted to look away, but I guess some sort of sick curiosity held me in place and I could swear that for a second I saw little drops of the blood float. 

I thought I was hallucinating when I saw the blood that was on the floor start to fly up into the air and into the arch, where it just swirled in place. I was so enthralled by the arch that I didn’t even notice a woman had gotten up the platform until her body had also collapsed. 

Even more blood was added to the swirl, and it was enough to snap me out of my trance and I continued to look for Layla.  

I looked at my phone to see that my battery was now on 20 percent which meant I only had about half an hour before it shut off, maybe less than that. If I didn’t find Layla by then, we would be trapped in complete darkness with whatever was going to happen once they finished. 

My heart was beating so fast that I couldn’t concentrate with the noise of the bodies collapsing. I looked up one more time to see Layla up on the platform behind a man and my heart fell into my stomach. 

She was next.

I quickly ran up to her and tried to pull her away, but it was like something was keeping her in place. 

“Layla! Layla! We have to go!” I yelled. 

The whispers kept getting louder and louder, but I couldn’t discern what they were saying. It was like they were speaking a long-forgotten language. 

“I can’t. I have to bring David back.” She mumbled. 

“David’s gone! He sent me a message the night before he died. I’m sorry. But he was going to divorce you. I wanted to tell you but…” I cried out. In reality, I was a fucking coward. I didn’t want to ruin my sister’s image of her faithful husband. 

She blinked a couple of times and mumbled again. 

“But David’s in there.” 

I quickly opened up my voicemail and scrolled through them until I found his last message and hit play. 

“Hey Xavier. I’m sorry man but I just can’t do it. I’m not in love with your sister anymore. I feel suffocated in this marriage. I know you told me to hold on and maybe things will get better. But I already spoke to a lawyer, and I’ll be obtaining the divorce papers pretty soon. Do you think you can come down for the weekend?” David’s voice echoed through the cave, and it looked like she was snapping out of it because tears starting to form. 

She got on her knees and continued and weep as she gripped the rock harder before throwing it into the floating swirl. The rock went into it and it didn’t bounce through the other side. It was like it got sucked into it and in an instant, we heard a thousand wails coming from all around us, but it wasn’t coming from anyone physically. 

It almost sounded like infants crying from the swirl. 

The swirl went from a deep red to an oily black color, and it started to take shape as something started to emerge from it. 

It resembled a black sphere and within seconds it began to morph and obtain more concise features. First it formed a white heart shaped face and then its eyes formed and looked directly at me. It looked like a barn owl but instead of white feathers making its face nice and soft, this one was completely smooth and hard. 

Its pitch-black eyes were burrowing into my soul. 

They were so full of hatred and malice like it was angry at me specifically. 

I mean..why wouldn’t it be. 

I interrupted its formation. 

But I knew that the minute it fully formed, it would go after me and then bring about the end. 

It was like some innate fear was activated and telling me to stop it before it came out. 

“What the fuck is that?” My sister cried out and I grabbed her hand and we jumped off the platform. 

We fell into some of the bodies pushing them over and instead of snapping them out of it, they responded with pure anger and grabbed my hair while another tried to choke me. 

My sister pushed them off me and I tried to run away but something tripped me. I fell onto the floor and when I looked up, I could see a woman, but her eyes were completely pitch black. 

She muttered angrily and started to laugh manically before taking a chunk of my flesh off calf with her teeth. I screamed in pain and my sister shoved her off and helped me with my side and we ran pushing through the sea of bodies. 

They were all laughing hysterically and trying to grab us, and I managed to spot my backpack. What the fuck did I have in there that could help me? I rushed in and tore it open causing a bunch of random shit to fall out. 

Fuck. 

Rope? No. 

Bandaids? No. 

A pocketknife? Maybe. 

Fireworks? When the fuck did, I add fireworks? 

I didn’t. David did. He was the one that helped me set up the bag. 

If I could light up one of the fireworks, it could cause an avalanche and seal the cave. 
I just had to find a way to get out of the cave while keeping them inside. 

Or maybe I didn’t. 

I pushed and stabbed my way towards Layla and grabbed her trying to stand her up. 

“We have to go! I can stay behind and set these off so the cave falls on them but you gotta go now.” 

She looked at my incredulously as if I were an idiot. 

“That’s not going to work. If you wanna cause an avalanche you gotta fire them outside and aimed at the top of the mountain. Now come on, we gotta go. They’re catching up. 

We ran and ran until we reached the entrance of the cave with those things on our tails. I looked back and I could see a couple of them made it through. I grabbed the knife and gave my sister a match and the fireworks and while she set them off, I tried to brace for a fight against those things. 

The fireworks began to go off and they stopped for a second and starred as several booms went off causing several colors to pop off. 

But that’s all it did. 

There was no large rumble nor shit collapsing. 

Me and Layla looked at each other and began to run as they began to chase us. 
I’m not sure how fast we ran but we made it to the car in less time than it took for me to reach the mountain before. I quickly drove out of there and right as I made it underneath a curve under the cave entrance there was  a large rumble and the ground shook violently as large piles of dirt and debris began to rain down behind us. We continued to drive until we reached the hospital and when we were questioned, we omitted the truth out of fear of imprisonment due to insanity or worse. 

We couldn’t exactly tell them that we were probably responsible for the deaths of hundreds of random people around the world because we tried to stop something primordial from entering our world. 

No one would believe us. 

My country isn’t exactly known for carrying out justice correctly. 

I did keep up with the reports of damage within the area and the investigations for a couple missing people led to nowhere. I contacted a couple of people who worked in search and rescue, and others who worked in clean-up crews and they didn’t find any remains or evidence of the cave. 

It simply never existed in their eyes. 

We both fully recovered, and my sister has been showing signs of returning to her former self. I on the other hand, am a little more fearful of the world around me. I can still see it’s pitch-black eyes boring into me whenever I close my eyes at night. 

It doesn’t help that slowly but surely my hearing has been atrophying as a result of hitting my head hard that day.  

The sound of a little ringing noise has been getting louder and louder with every night. 

But it’s just tinnitus. 

Right?

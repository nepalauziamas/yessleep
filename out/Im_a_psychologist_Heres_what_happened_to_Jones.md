This is super late an update, it’s been more than a year since I’ve last mentioned Jones, I think. Probably very few of you would remember him, or give a shit at this point, but I just wanted to get this out there. Just in case anyone was ever curious about what happened to Jones. And also, so that I could get some closure, I guess. 

So [last I updated,](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/p9n480/im_a_psychologist_i_see_things_that_others_dont/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) Jones had helped me to get rid of that malevolent creature who had been feeding on me. By, if you remember, feeding off it himself. In fact, he consumed it whole. Having ingested that much evil from that creature, Jones became a little less…benevolent. 

In case you haven’t read the past updates, here’s a really quick summary. I had a client, Dave (fake name), who told me that his significant progress was due to him having a 24/7 therapist. This therapist, Jones, also happened to be a hallucination of his. At least, I had believed that [he hallucinated a therapist](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ox34oo/im_a_psychologist_my_client_sees_things_that/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). I quickly realised that Jones was very much real, as I began to see him too. Turns out, I had a dark creature attached to me, feeding off my life force or energy or something, and Dave kindly sent Jones to me to help get rid of it. [Which Jones did, by ingesting that thing](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/p1p9hs/im_a_psychologist_my_client_sees_things_that/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). 

I know, I know it all sounds ludicrous. Like a really badly written C-movie. But it happened. Guess life *is* stranger than fiction.

So, last I saw Jones, after he had ingested that creature, he had taken on some physical features of that thing. His skin went from a reassuring warm ruddy complexion to a pale, waxen film. His eyes had turned into a deeper shade of...void. Not exactly black. More like this emptiness that kind of pulls you in when you look at them. 

His demeanour had changed too. His smile, once warm and comforting, became a terrifying sight that sent chills down my spine. He also began to spend a lot of time just watching me, an unreadable expression on his face. 

Needless to say, Dave had been heartbroken. I felt terrible, having to tell him what had happened to Jones, his saviour and trusted therapist. I could only try to make up for it by giving Dave free therapy sessions, as often as I could, sometimes up to 4 times a week. He spent quite a few sessions just processing his resentment towards me, his grief at losing Jones in a way, and his guilt for agreeing to send Jones to me. But that’s another story all together. 

So Jones didn’t go back to Dave. We didn’t trust the changed Jones. It’s not that Jones ended up a homicidal maniac. He didn’t do anything evil, anything really bad. He just wasn’t…well, someone I could trust, anyway. It didn’t help that he often had on the demeanour and expression of one who was plotting evil. Thankfully, there were still major traces of the Jones I knew from before that still remained within him. Often, he would seem to revert back to his old, kind self, and those times broke my heart while giving me hope at the same time. 

I tried to do for Jones what I could. At times, when he was more his old self, we would talk about what we could do to get him to back to normal. As normal as someone from another world could be, that is. He confirmed what I suspected, that when he feeds on creatures, he takes in their life force, but this life force can be recovered if he does not feed off the creature again for a sufficient amount of time. It was a huge relief, for after all, he had fed off me before. I had some fears that perhaps feeding on my life force meant shortening my life span, but thankfully that seemed not to be the case. So the only concern was that if he overfed at any one time, he might leave too little life force in the creature to allow for recovery. As had happened in the past. 

After we sorted out the mechanics of his feeding, we decided that he could feed off me on a regular basis, but only in small amounts and with enough time in between each “session” for me to fully recuperate. We hoped that with more of my life force, my “essence”, he would be brought closer to a good balance of benevolence and malevolence. 

But the problem was, I wasn’t really a good person. I mean, I’m at least halfway decent, I think, and I tend to choose helping over harming, but I also wasn’t exactly the pinnacle of kindness and patience. In fact, outside of my work, I don’t exactly have the bandwidth to be compassionate and patient with non-clients. I might even be quite accurately described as “irritable”. And on occasion, pretty damn snide. I mean, I try to care, but I just lack the mental bandwidth, especially after an entire workday of opening my heart to and drumming up compassion for my clients. It’s not an easy job.

So, Jones’ progress wasn’t going to be fast, I knew that. Sometimes, I wondered if my “essence” was perhaps even tipping the scales in the undesirable direction. 

I mean, the quickest way for him to recover positive energy (not sure what else to call it) would probably be for him to feed off golden retrievers or something, I mean, that would neutralise that dark energy so damn quickly. Trouble is, even though he had seemed his old self when he told me that feeding on someone’s life force didn’t affect their lifespan and can be done safely, I didn’t trust him completely. Part of me wondered if he had said that with ulterior motives. Perhaps he was truly draining my life and hastening my death with each feeding. But I was willing to take that chance. I mean, I was responsible for him turning into this…hybrid creature anyway. 

But I wasn’t willing to risk any dog’s life. 

Eventually, we worked out a system to diversify his sources of “positive energy”. I’m kinda ashamed to admit it, but we became almost like a scam team. I would fake being in trouble in a public space, and whenever someone came up to help, Jones would try to get a sense of their overall “vibes”, to see if they have positive energy. If they did, he would drink in some of their life force. I know, I know, it’s really bad form and a shit way to repay kindness. But I just had to trust that his feeding would do no long-term harm. We also visited volunteering organisations and sought out those who were volunteering out of the pure goodness of their hearts, none of those pretentious, look-at-me-I’m-doing-good types. 

Progress was still incredibly slow, given that we could only do this when Jones was more his old self. Which was around half the time, but the unpredictability of when his old self would surface made it really difficult to plan these…outings. His darker side didn’t do much to harm me, other than once in a while trying to leave the gas stove on, things like that. But the old Jones would always cut in and put an end to whatever scheme had been concocted by his darker impulses. I was scared though, almost all the time, that any day, Jones’ dark side would take over and do something irreversible, something Jones wouldn’t be able to stop in time.  

Before long, I was completely wiped. Burnt out. I was spending my work days with clients, which honestly, drains me the hell out, and my work nights and weekends with Jones, seeking out positive energy. Not to mention, the regular feedings I offered Jones. And the fear of that part of him. My moods were horrible most of the time, I was full of anxiety, paranoia and stress. 

One day, when Jones was about to tuck in and get his ration of “positive energy”, he stopped, and said, sadness and solemnness lacing his voice, “You aren’t exactly positive anymore.”

My eyes widened. “Wait, what?”

“Your energy…it’s becoming really…volatile.”

I remember sitting back down in shock. I had known I wasn’t in a good place. That I was wiped out. That I was becoming increasingly bitter. Sometimes even spitting vitriol at inanimate objects that got in my way. Like swearing at the table that day, after I had knocked my head against it. Like full blown swearing, shrill curses that lasted almost 20 minutes.

But I didn’t expect to no longer even qualify as a basically good person. To not even have more “positive” energy than bad. 

I shut my eyes, and felt hot tears of shame well up. There was a long pause as I just sat there, silent. Jones’ awkwardness was palpable. 

“Hey,” he spoke up nervously, “it’s not that you’re a bad person. It’s just that your energy’s…tainted. There’s a lot of weariness and angst, but not like, you know, *evil* evil. I mean, I’m not saying you’re…” Jones’ words tumbled forth, before I interrupted him. 

“It’s fine. I get it. Really. There’s no need to try to make me feel better. I feel like shit these days.”

We were again silent for a while after that. 

“You know,” Jones started again, “I could do these things without you. Without feeding on you. Without your company. I really feel much better these days. I know it’s been slow, but I do feel more in control than that other side of me. You don’t have to wear yourself out. You can take a break. You need one.”

I agreed with that, for sure. But I wasn’t sure if I trusted him to do good without any form of supervision. But who else could watch over him? Not Dave. Dave was coping well, but barely. He couldn’t deal with this. And no one else could see Jones. 

But things couldn’t continue as is. So we made a decision. I would stay with him a few more weeks, with him independently attending volunteering events, vetting volunteers, and hovering around homeless people, checking out those who gave money or bought food/drinks for them, He would feed on those deemed more “positive”. We would discuss how things went each day when he got home. He would also stop feeding on me, though it was not like that was an option, with my bad juju and whatnot.

The weeks passed, and in those weeks, Jones seemed well able to manage his behaviours and to progress independently. I arranged for another psychologist to take over Dave’s care at special rates, and left. 

I finally did what I had wanted to do for years. I took time off from being a psychologist and went traveling. A cliché, I know, but I really needed to escape. 

In between my travels, around once every two months or so, I returned, to check on him. 

The most recent time I returned, I was amazed. 

We were home, and I had ordered pizza for myself. I was having a few beers while we chilled out on the sofa. We were swapping stories, updating each other on the stuff that had happened over the past 2 months. I headed to the loo at one point, and naturally, that was when the pizza decided to show up. 

Hearing the door bell, I was hurrying to finish up and scurry out to get the pizza, when I heard the door opening. Then heard the pizza guy greeting Jones, and Jones greeting him back. And heard Jones confirming that the pizza had been paid for online. As I walked out of the loo, I watched as Jones gave the guy a tip, from my wallet, for having biked here in the rain. Then stared as Jones closed the door and set the pizza box down on the coffee table.

I continued to stare at him, dumbfounded. 

He looked at me, and grinned. “I wanted it to be a surprise.”

“You…you can touch things. You can…People can see you. They hear you. You…you paid that guy,” I stuttered, still completely stumped.

He smiled sheepishly. “Yeah. The first time someone shouted ‘oi’ at me when I walked into him, I got a huge shock. Then it kept happening. People greeted me at the supermarket, the homeless told me to piss off and stop hovering about them. Cars honked at me, women ran when I followed them…That’s when I realised, I had taken on solid form in this world.”

I stared at him, speechless, mouth agape. 

“That’s why I insisted you get the extra large pizza too. I wanted to break the news to you with pizza. I figured I should mix some awesomeness in to soften the blow,” he said, picking up a slice of pizza. He bit in, and closed his eyes in happiness. 

“I can’t get over how…” he chewed for a bit and swallowed, “amazing pizza tastes. I can’t believe you guys have been living with such crazy taste fests.”

“What in the fucking world happened?!” I finally shrilled. I couldn’t help it, it was too mind-bending for me. Even after all that shit I’d experienced both with him and during my travels, this was a little too much for me. 

“I don’t know! My theory is that having consumed enough life force here, I gradually manifested a visible, tangible form. Having sampled off so many humans, I must have taken on the ability to *be* human. To function as one. I’ve also taken on quite a few gifts, by the way, one of which is baking. I can make a meanass lava cake.”

I just stared at him, then began to circle him, examining every part of his body. 

“Holy…this is crazy, dude,” I said, completing my rounds, then grabbed the receipt, balled it up and lobbed it at him. It bounced off him. “Oh my god,” I said, and flicked the cheese packet at him. He caught it. 

“I CANNOT BELIEVE THIS,” I exclaimed, picking up the chilli flakes packet.

“Stop it,” he said, amused, grabbing the packet from my hand. “Stop chucking things at me.”

I sat down heavily on the sofa. “So what the hell do we do now?”

He sat down next to me. “Honestly? I think I’d just be human now. I haven’t had to feed off anyone in a month. I’ve been sustaining myself via food. Oh, by the way, you would find quite a lot of charges to your emergency credit card. I’m sorry. Also, I’ve been buying some new clothes, but I’ve done the laundry, don’t worry.”

“So you’re…fully human now? Are you…good?” I asked, feeling a little silly.

He chuckled. “I am, I think so, yes.”

“Oh shit, we really got to get you all the identification stuff. You know, a passport, a card, whatnot. How the hell are we going to explain your sudden existence in this realm?” I asked, my mind beginning to work overtime. 

“Hey man, we’d figure it out. I have some ideas already. I’ve been doing my research. And I also fed off some interesting characters, so I’ve some solid information as well.”

I raised an eyebrow, but didn’t inquire after these ‘interesting characters’. 

He smiled again, so much warmth in his smile that I felt myself getting teary. I missed the old Jones. And finally, he was back. It seemed so, at least. 

“Hey, thanks so much for all that stuff you’ve done for me. It’s insane, really, how much you were willing to do for me.” He raised a hand to stop me from arguing. “It’s really not your fault for that dark creature thing. I chose to do it.” He waved off my further protests.

“But, if you feel bad about it,” he said, an impish smile on his face, “you can let me be your roommate for now, while I figure things out, and get a job. Hey, I might even be able to rent a place soon, get my own life, get some hobbies, get to dating, who knows.”

I liked the picture he was painting. But I had a really weird thought then. “Hey, if you like, get married, and have a kid…what do you think the kid will be like? Would the kid be…solid? Would the kid be like, the first representative of both species? Like part whatever you were, part human?”

A dark look crossed his face. “I hadn’t thought of that,” he said simply, and his expression turned heavy.

“Shit dude, there’ no need to think of that.” His expression remained sullen. “Hey man, I’m sorry! Really, I mean, let’s focus on just who you are now, what you’ve achieved. You can have a whole life now! You can interact with anyone you want to, do anything you want. Be anybody you want to be. Besides, who wants kids? I mean, being child-free is like the in-thing now. Even I don’t want a kid,” I expelled the words in a rush, trying to cheer him up. 

He did seem to cheer up somewhat, though he still looked a little downcast. 

I passed him a beer. 

“Here. Cheers to being human! Cheers to your new life!” I said as enthusiastically as I could, and smiled as widely as I could.

He perked up then, seeming to temporarily let go of his worries. He broke into a sunny smile, and bopped my can of beer with his. 

“Cheers! To being human!”

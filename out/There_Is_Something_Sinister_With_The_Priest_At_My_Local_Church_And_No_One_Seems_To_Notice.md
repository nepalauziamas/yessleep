Sweat pouring from my whole body, my mind could not withstand the evil that is hidden inside a holy man. If I was even a second late, I would not be here driving as far away as possible from a peaceful town that is fooled by the devil inside it. Like a herd of innocent white sheep following a false shepherd, the self proclaimed priest somehow convinced everyone in town that it is a holy man from god. Sadly I had no choice but to run away, leaving all my family, friends, associates and even my belongings I had to leave immediately.

I stopped by in a nearby hostel inside the lounge room I am nervously writing and keeping records of everything that has happened to me like a documentary, A documentary that no one will ever believe. Please refer to me as Michael and what I am about to tell you is an experience that will haunt me for the rest of my days and I could only truly pray for the safety of my family that I had abandoned.

My family and I owned a farm at a town isolated from the world known as "Redsville". We had lived here for over 20 years and its one of those towns that are lacking in terms of what most modern cities have but the beautiful nature of trees and mountains that surrounds the town is what made the Redsville's reputation named as "Garden of Paradise". Its a town that nurtures the religious culture within the Christianity aspect so its not surprising that everyone goes to church every Sunday. I mean it literally, every single soul on this town attends the church on Sundays so the town is left empty for an hour or so. Everyone at Redsville knows each other, each face I met and spoke with is no stranger to me.

Redsville may be known for its beautiful nature that surrounds it but the church that was built upon it has the most beautiful architecture designs that I had ever seen. Biased as I may sound, its texture of white marbles and gold plating that mostly covers the church stands out with coloured glass window that's designed as the disciples of Jesus Christ placed on all 4 walls inside it followed by a long red carpet that leads to a clean altar where the priests and its 2 helpers stand by. Even the row of flowers and the field of pure green grass that surrounds it. It's pretty much this town's pride and treasure.

My family consists of 1 son, 1 daughter and my beloved wife. For this documentary I do not wish to put their real name for personal reasons. Instead I will call my Son "Jack", My Daughter "Azy" and My Wife "Mory". Most of their lives have spent living in Redsville and they loved every part of it, every Sunday we will attend church and complete our prayers of session and afterwards we always go for a picnic in a nearby waterfall spot. The water from the waterfall itself is clean and drinkable, you do not need to use any filtering system as proven by the people of this town. We had lived out our lives and I can only pray to god that this peace will be kept forever for me and my family, it truly is a blessing that no money can buy.

My profession consist of being the Sheriff of the town on the look for any trouble and patrolling the streets of Redsville but it was peaceful for the past 20 years since I moved into this town but this has not let my guard down unlike the other sheriffs working with me. One day in the office, there has been a rumour that the current priest of this town is planning to leave Redsville to visit his family to another country. This rumour has spread like wildfire and the topic became the talk of the town. However this rumour was confirmed by the priest himself at church where everyone gathered and at that point everyone has been wondering of an arrival of a new priest and whether the priest will live up to the expectations of this town. The priest however notified the town that the new priest will arrive in 2 days after his departure. This was an unusual schedule to date as I would assume that his service of over 50 years at this town, he would take his time and watch over the new priest. But the question was answered when the priest explained that his flight schedule is tight within 2 days so he had no choice.

The town itself was surprised and now everyone is thanking for his service as a priest for 50 years who created new families, rekindled love and brought the wisdom of god to everyone. In everyone's eyes he was like an angel, a man of pure heart with kindness. Everyone thinks that no other priest will ever replace him. Upon his last day for departure, everyone in town was sad to see him leave but at the same time was happy for him to venture into the world, he at least deserved that much. Everyone waved their hands as we see him leave in an taxi to the airport. When the whole town could no longer see him as far as the horizon stretches. It somehow brought a sense of emptiness to everyone and I also felt the same way.

Personally I thought I should give a speech to help reassure that it is not the end of the world.

"Everyone, your attention please." I said.

"I know how you all feel, I feel the same way. I truly do. This is not the end, our journey for our prayers towards god is simply the beginning. I am aware that the new priest that will be arriving tomorrow may not feel the same but we must accept him as a whole and make him one of us!" I said loudly.

As I raised my fist, the smile on everyone's face has returned and everyone started to cheer. I never knew I had good morale support but my relationship with this town was probably the main aspect of it. My Wife Mory approached me along with the kids, embracing me along with a kiss.

"That was a nice thing for you to do and that's why I married you" Mory said.

"I will do everything for this family, and you know that" I said in a more silent tone.

Jack and Azy stared at us in disgust of our kiss.

"Ewww!" Jack & Azy exclaimed in disgust.

"What? That's what a dad and mom do" I said.

"Daddy can we please get Ice cream?" Azy begged with a cute face.

"Of course! You guys want Vanilla?" I asked.

"Yes please!" Jack said excitingly.

Our day went by and spending time with family is a blessing God had given me. I only hope it won't be taken away from me. That night, me and my wife were in bed together talking about what will be of the new priest that will arrive tomorrow morning. As always I reassured her that everything will be fine whilst promising her to protect the town and the family. The night ended with her kissing my lips and slept peacefully.

My alarm rung loudly, my heavy eyes struggling to keep itself open with enough strength to turn the alarm off. 4:59 AM it said. I started to make preparations for my morning shift at the sheriff's office. Upon leaving my home past the door I immediately started noticing the dark clouds were emanating from the sky. I though the sun had not risen up yet but looking at my watch it read "8:45 AM" at this point we would have seen the ray of sunlight passing through the town. I though to myself that it must be a raincloud passing by which is not unusual.

Upon walking towards the front gate of the town. That's when I felt it. An unexplainable fear lingering in my mind. Even my primal Instincts are screaming danger as if a predator is lurking nearby hunting for its next prey. I have never felt anything like this for 20 years. I then saw him. A dark figure appeared in the distance specifically at the front gate. It latched unto my gaze and for a moment it got me shaking slightly. I took whatever courage I could find to investigate. Upon closer inspection I realised its the new priest wearing a typical black suit tailored for priests. The new priest also happened what seemed to be two large duffle bags.

The new priest casually introduced himself as "Luci" with a grin look on his face trying to imitate a smile. I then introduced myself and welcoming him to the town.

"Hello there! You must be the new priest?" I asked.

"Indeed I am! Beautiful town I must say, I heard it was known as Garden of Paradise?" Luci asked curiously.

"Um. Yes it is. But its mainly known as Redsville" I explained.

"Sorry, the name Garden of Paradise just takes me back in my earlier days!" Luci said.

"Sir you have visited this town before?" I asked.

"Not exactly but that was a long time ago, before you were even born haha!" Luci joked.

I simply laughed along and pretended to go along with whatever he's saying. But honestly this guy's creepy vibes is on a whole new level that I could not explain. I could only think for the worst but maybe I am overthinking about it as I am not used to meeting people like Luci. Maybe one day I will probably get used to it and call it the new normal. Luci then asked if I could take him around town and introduce him to the people. A part of me is telling me not to let him inside but on the other hand I had no choice as he was the only priest willing to continue his service in a town so isolated from society. First impression is important but Luci gave me the chills and instantly made me want to avoid him at all cost for no reason.

As I escorted Luci around town to greet the people. The interaction between them and Luci just seemed so casual and easy as if they had already accepted him. One after another, Luci would start greeting himself and the people would smile in excitement for a new priest and oddly enough they seem to get along too well. At this point it's probably just me overthinking but I just can't shake off the feeling that something is not right with the new priest. One of the other sheriffs approached me and asked what was going on as they seem to describe me as "Someone who had just seen a ghost". As ironic as that sounds, I told them to meet me later at the office after I finished escorting Luci around town.

I asked Luci if he wanted to go to the church which will be his main venue for his service as a priest and he agreed. While making our way there, I asked Luci some questions like I was indirectly interrogating him by masking it as a friendly conversation. I asked him basic stuff such as his origin of birth, ethnicity, experiences, relatives and all that sort of basic stuff. His answers seem to be nothing out of the ordinary as it turns out that he was born in England and had served under his father as his right hand at the church for 6 years or so. Like some families today, Luci is not in very good terms with his father as he had been "banished" by him as Luci describes it. It was an odd wording for him to use but i simply assumed that he is familiar with his vocabulary.

Upon arriving to the church, I simply went inside expecting Luci to follow me but looking back he hesitated to come inside. I stared at Luci and asked him what was wrong. Luci just said nothing and had continued to stare at the church almost as if he despises it because i can clearly see it on his face. I  disturbed his moment and asked him again a more louder tone.

"Luci. What's Wrong?" I asked.

Luci shook his head a little as if he returned from a daze back to reality. And said in response that "Nothing is wrong". I found Luci's behaviour quite odd and had only fed my suspicion even greater. As we went inside I showed him the alter and told him that he can do whatever with it as he sees fit since Luci will be our priest for many years to come. One thing I also noticed, was that Luci started to wear a pair of thin layered black gloves before touching the holy grails and the cross for him in front of the altar to inspect. I found this unusual but though nothing of it as if he may have some sort of Hygiene issue. But it's a little weird since the holy grails and the cross itself was very clean, you could even see yourself in its reflection. The holy bible however, was not touched by Luci at all as he seemed to only stare at it for a few couple of seconds. 

During those few seconds I noticed Luci's eyes starting to glow red ever so slightly when he looked at the bible. I thought I was imagining things and it was a long morning for me. Luci then said.

"Could you leave me alone? I would like to make special preparations for the upcoming wedding". he said with a smile so perfect yet creepy. I asked him. 'What Wedding?". Quite surprisingly I never heard about it since gossip would reach to me about it. 

"You don't know? It's a wedding between Adam & Eve!" Luci exclaimed. 

Adam was a sheriff like me working among the ranks and he did mention awhile ago that he planned to propose to Eve, a girl he met within the town where she worked as a gardener. Curious I asked Luci how he could have contained this information especially on his first day in the town. According to Luci, he was given notice of the marriage by our former priest of the town via letters. The wedding will be held at the next Sunday which is in 5 days. Luci continued to smile at me giving me an indirect prompt to leave him alone. I followed along and left to go to the sheriff's office. As I walked along the red carpet leading to the exit of the church, i felt as if Luci was still staring at me. The feeling of being watched behind your back is heavily creepy, i had to walk out quickly. 

There was something not normal with Luci, ever since he arrived to Redsville. I had my suspicions on him being some sort of imposter, pretending to be a holy man in this town is a crime not tolerated. But it seems our former priest had some connections with Luci so i could not judge. I arrived at the sheriff office and I asked my co-workers what they think about Luci. To my surprise they all have positive responses saying that he seemed nice and that he was actually an easy guy to socialise with. They even commented how the new priest Luci would be a better replacement than our former priest. I looked at them confused, it was almost as if Luci was able to charm everyone in the town, naturally this would be a reasonable answer but in only one day they have already felt this way. One of the officers asked.

"Michael, what do you think about the new priest?" 

I hesitated to speak a word and thinking about whether I should tell them my true thoughts about Luci. I decided to do so and told them that I find Luci very suspicious and he's probably not the man everyone thinks he is. I even told them about that one time that I saw Luci's eyes turn red when he was inside the church. The sheriffs and other staff all began to stare at me like I was some kind of madman who developed a syringe that turns normal people into zombies. In their own disbelief they simply defended Luci and had assumed that I was probably tired or paranoid. I though to myself that they were probably right, i may have looked at this the wrong way. Eventually the conversation steered off into Adam and Eve's upcoming wedding this Sunday and the fact that the wedding will be hosted by Father Luci himself makes it the more exciting for them. I still can't shake off the feeling that there is something wrong with Luci and that I should simply keep an eye on him. My senses however are telling me that Luci was not a normal human, its something way worse but cannot comprehend to describe it. 

Days went by right up until Sunday. The town had helped prepare the wedding. Farmers and Cooks worked together to create a banquet especially the wedding cake frosted in pure vanilla with Adam and Eve's name on it. The other towns worked on setting up tables, chairs, events and games for children and adults alike. This might be the biggest wedding this town ever had over the years. Even Luci helped out with the arrangements and seeing him get along with the town seem to have calmed my suspicions and doubts. 

On Sunday the day of the wedding, strangely enough I started seeing those dark clouds again floating above the town. Dark clouds that are not emanating drops of rain from it. Regardless of the weather, the town have continued to attend the wedding where Luci will be helping the newly wed couple Adam & Eve make their vows and promises. The whole town was filling the church and with the excitement for the new weds all their smiles and cries were visible, it truly seems to be a moment for them. Even my family who was sitting right beside me were excited for the moment. 

I then noticed something odd with the altar. The holy grails and the bible were missing. The altar was only left with an empty table with a cross placed upside down surrounded by newly lit candles. No one seems to have noticed it or even question it. They simply get along as if everything was normal. Luci was standing behind the altar waiting for the newly weds to walk to the front of the altar to begin the tradition. Music started playing with the piano playing along quite beautifully. As the newly weds walked together towards the altar, Luci's eyes turned to complete darkness with black veins surrounding it. And what happened next instantly gave me the fear and terror to realise what is unravelling in this wedding. 

Blood started to leak from Luci's mouth as it widens not like any human would ever do. He then started to levitate slowly in mid air while enchanting something for what sounded like ancient Latin. Luci spoke the following words.

"Kā tumšs kritušais eņģelis no debesīm es dāvāšu šīm divām dvēselēm savu tumšāko svētību, savu ticību un ciešanas mūžībai." 

As he continued to chant, something grew from his back. 10 large dark limbs resembling a spider's 8 legs tearing up from each side. I spoke out loud to alarm everyone at church including those outside. 

"Guys what the fuck? Are you guys even seeing this?" I exclaimed. 

As I looked around, the people simply continued their prayers and singing along oblivious to what was truly happening. Even my family did nothing and continued as if nothing is happening. In panic I spoke to my family. 

"Mory! We have to get the kids out of here! That priest is a fucking demon!" I said. 

My wife Mory looked at me in confusion and said "Dear, are you feeling okay? Nothing is wrong."

That's when I realised. My suspicions, my gut. I should have realised what was truly going on. Out of deep fear I decided to ran away abandoning my family. Luci saw me and screeched in the most terrifying sound I could ever hear in my entire life. On his final form, Luci was some sort of skinless demonic spider with dark eyes staring deep into my soul. Without hesitation I ran as fast as I could away from the church towards my car which is parked 650 meters away. 

With all my strength and speed available in my body I ran like no tomorrow. I instantly regretted when I looked back, seeing Luci was chasing towards me with his large spider legs. I grabbed the handgun in my holster and decided to fire at Luci in a rapid session until the magazine was empty. I could hear Luci screaming in pain but his moans were deeper and more angrier but it seemed I slowed him down even a little. I was closer to my car and rushed inside to put the key in and start the car. My anxiety and fear grew bigger when the car failed to start for the first time. 

"COME ON COME ON COME ON!" I shouted. 

I kept twisting the keys hoping that the car would start. And seeing that Luci is coming closer and closer, I could already see his deathly grin coming for me. 

"GOD PLEASE HELP ME!!!!" I screamed at the top of my lungs. 

To my biggest relief, the car had started and I slammed down the accelerator to drive away from the god-forsaken monster as fast as possible. I sped right past the gate of the town slamming the gate open. I could see that I am gaining distance between me and Luci. I kept going and going, never stopping. While this was going on, i had thought about my promise to protect my family and since I had failed to protect them. Tears poured down from my face and I then cried in guilt. 

"FUCK FUCK FUCK!!!!!" I shouted while slamming the steering wheel. 

I looked straight into the road passing by forest trees for what seemed like foreign now. At that point my mind was still disturbed and I could not get a clear though of what I just witnessed. Whatever that monster was, where it even came from. I'm sure that it does not belong in the human realm. 

At that point I even realised that calling the cops will be useless. Because it seemed Luci has the ability to charm everyone in town and somehow make them oblivious to who he truly was and being able to morph into a demon, I am sure he would have no problems reverting back into a human once more. The real question was, why was I not affected? Could my instincts alone be able to surpass the charms of a demon or was it something else? 

After what felt like hours of driving thinking about the monster. I saw a hostel nearby and decided to clear my mind and calm down. While doing so, writing down everything that I had experienced. Which had led me to this point right now. Truly I had questions, questions that I am willing to find answers in hopes that I can get my family away from the monster. 

I had made plans to meet up with our former priest as he was the only person I know who seems to be connected to Luci. I had a feeling that he should know something. I am planning to leave asap to the airport to meet with him overseas. Luckily I have my credit card and banking details of my savings so money should not be a problem for now. Till then I have to remain cautious and so I had to change my clothes and identity in case Luci is trying to track me down.

I need advice on how to get out of this, I guess it all started when I saw there was a clinical ad in the newspaper- offering over 10 grand and promising extra money depending on ill-effects, I really should've known it was going to be fucked up at that but my parents had recently kicked me out of the house after I told them I had a boyfriend, so I really needed the money, and I responded to the phone number listed, being promptly told to come to a basement, which really should've been red flag number two, but I decided to go almost immediately, I really didn't want someone else to go get the money before me.  


Arriving in my house/run down old car, I knocked on the door and was greeted with a very dirty old man, almost like he didn't know he had to shower. I didn't know what to do, it quickly came into my thoughts that this wasn't a lab, this might not even be a doctor, and there might be nothing legally protecting me here, I kinda accepted that I'd be murdered in this property- He could easily overpower me and I knew it so I decided to play cool and act like nothing was wrong, and he brought me downstairs to the basement, sitting me in a chair in the middle of the room. Another man- a colleague I'd have to guess came over and told me to stick out my tongue, I really didn't want to but I felt sort've...compelled to, and a pill was then placed into my mouth, and upon being told to swallow I promptly did so.   


This next part is hard to describe....it felt like, my soul was ripped throughout my body, with unimaginable pain, like I felt a hundred bee stings across every nerve in my entire body and I was pretty sure I promptly passed out. When I came to I was floating...outside my body, it wasn't impressive from the outside, thin, after all I had never worked out, although this sad realization came to me, what came next was worse. My body opened it's eyes, and started speaking.   


"How long do I have this time?" He said, gesturing to the two.  
They shrugged and replied maybe a month, and I swear I felt him grin at me, as he stood up and left, there's a few things I quickly realized, I'd need to be near him at all times, about within 10 feet, if I went out of that I'd be dragged, and I couldn't interact with anything in the real world, it was like I was a ghost. I spent the first week wailing, trying to see if I could find any way to communicate with anyone, night after night watching that fucker fuck my boyfriend, I wanted to strangle him- I felt like he was taunting me, I didn't have to eat, or sleep or do pretty much anything, but when you don't need to do anything and also can't do anything, true boredom falls in.  


He was living my life, acting like me, doing exactly what I would do, no one could tell the difference, not even my sister and we've been close our entire lives. I felt true despair- that is until I managed one night to flicker the lights on and off, my body was asleep but my boyfriend wasn't, and I knew this was my big chance- you see my boyfriends a little bit of a tech nerd, he absolutely adores morse code and it's one of the very geeky things I loved about him, especially since we taught it to me. I knew this was my chance to communicate to him. After about a month of no contact.  


"I M P O S T E R" I communicated.  
"Imposter? Who?" He replied  
"B O Y F R I E N D. N O T M E" 

"Oh god, the lights are actually talking to me...I must be going crazy." He said to himself, I wished I could speak faster.  
"S T O L E M Y B O D Y, S W E E T I E"  
I thought maybe if I added what I always called him, he'd believe me...and after looking at him with careful consideration, he nodded, I don't think he could see me, but he believed me, I was so overjoyed.  


So overjoyed in fact, I didn't see the baseball bat swing at his head at an ungodly amount of speed, but I did see his brain matter all over the walls, I also saw my body holding the bat. I promptly passed out once more, my actual body...and my ghostly form. I think it must've been hours but I woke up in my own body in the morning, the mess the exact same, it was way too late for me to get help for him, and that was almost the worst discovery I made.  


But it wasn't, no, the worst discovery was when the lights in my room communicated to me, saying "C Y A. IN. O N E. Y E A R."

I witnessed something I can’t explain last night. 

Long story short, I’m taking a few classes over the summer at my high school. I flunked out of a few last semester due to some health issues. That’s why I’m at school in July. 

I forgot my charger in one of the classrooms today and didn’t realize it until later in the day. It’s the only charger I have and I can’t afford a new one until next week. 

My best friend’s dad is the custodian, so I texted her to ask her dad if he could let me in the building to grab it. At about 9:15pm, she tells me I’m good to run over and her dad will let me in. 

My house is in walking distance from the school, so I grabbed my bike and met him at the east entrance. 

I got there about 5 minutes later, maybe 9:20. He let me in, and said he was going to finish up cleaning the east bathrooms and to just let him know when I’m leaving. 

I made my way to the classroom and walked past the gym doors, which were closed like all the other doors. I went to the classroom, grabbed the charger and headed back. 

On my way back I started to hear this pitter-pattering sound, like rain on the roof. But I knew it wasn’t rain because the sky was completely clear just 5 minutes ago. As I kept walking, I noticed it was getting louder. I turned down the hallway that led to the gym, and the sound got louder. Pitter-pattering with some quiet squeaking. I couldn’t place what it was. 

As I got closer, I noticed the gym doors were open. I slowed down. As I got closer, the sound was definitely coming from inside the gym. 

I peeked around the corner, kind of nervous because I didn’t know if someone else was in the building, or if my friend’s dad was in there, or what it was. 

As I looked in the doors, I was more confused than scared at first. It was dark inside, all the lights were off. Also inside,  were people. Like, a lot of people. At least a hundred. It looked like they were not quite dancing, but jumping around really close together like you would at a dance. 

They were all in casual clothes and looked completely normal. But I was struck with this horrible queasy feeling. Like something was terribly wrong. But I was still so confused. This room was full of people moving around but making no noise but their feet hitting the ground and the soft squeak of shoes. 

I didn’t realize I was moving until I was in the room. I let out a strangled little “hey” and everything stopped. The people stopped moving abruptly and the sound of their feet stopped. 

My heart leapt into my throat and adrenaline pumped through me. Everyone slowly turned to look at me. 

I can’t explain why, but something was terribly wrong. Their eyes were just a little too shiny. Their faces just a little too off, like that concept I always hear about creepy stuff—uncanny valley. Just a little not human, you know? And this could have been my imagination, but I feel like they looked….hungry. 

So of course I turned the fuck around and ran down the hallway towards the east entrance. I couldn’t hear much over the pounding of my feet and my heart, but it sounded like there were steps behind me. Like they were chasing me. 

I ran and I ran until I was out the doors, where I was met by my friends dad and another friends dad, who is a cop. 

I was confused because I had only been gone a few minutes. I asked what was wrong and why they were outside. 

My first friend’s dad, the custodian, told me I had been inside for almost an hour. I didn’t believe them and checked my watch. It was 10:30. 

I told them what happened. I expected them to not believe me, but they just looked at each other. 

The custodian told me if I ever need to come back at night, to have him walk me. He said, and I quote “Sometimes strange thing happen here. You’ll be okay, just try not to dwell on it.” 

My other friend’s dad, the cop, offered me a ride home, which I accepted. 

I got home and crashed, totally drained. I wrote this up as soon as I woke up. 

Has anyone experienced anything like this?

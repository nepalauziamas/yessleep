It was a midday in May. Just hanging out with my friends. Everything was normal
Oh boy, how different it was going to go.
We eventually had to go, so i went home like the rest, but something was off. Time seemed to go faster, and before i could process this, it was nearly 11pm already. 2pm to 11pm in what was for me 9 minutes. 9 hours, in 9 minutes.

Some instinct kicked in and told me to run, so i did. i ran to home, where i thought it was. i say 'thought' as the grassy plateau i was galloping across manically stretched forever. the same trees in the same criss cross pattern. That bench dedicated to the old man who would care for the lost puppies and kittens alike. Even the same blades of individual grass, that.. plastic-y grass..

I decided running wasnt working, and i'd need to conserve my energy. I could drink from the pond nearby, eat some apples from the trees, besides, i've got an infinite backrooms-sized plateau of these things. i can last a while.

Wandering to explore in a different direction led me to an empty journal , equipped with a 2 pens and a lock. And to top it all off, my name. Plastered in big letters on the front.
*OP'S PERSONAL JOURNAL*
What. The Hell.

Day 5 of being in the plateau, I recorded how this place works. And decided its probably another plane of existance. The endless cycle, the fruit that regrows within the day, a day/night cycle of only around 4 hours. Relative to standard earth time of course.

Day 8 and something changed.
Whilst out scavenging, i discovered a beeping red light in the grass far beyond usual limits before it loops. The area of where i had before it looped around had increased by about 2km in each cardinal direction. The flashing red light turned out to be a device of somekind, with runes on it i've never seen before. Not human thats for sure

Day 14. I managed to open the device using a penny, guess they really are lucky, huh? But inside it was blank. No battery. No wires. No LEDs. I decided to put the cover back on, and maybe try find something to activate it.

Day 27, My usable area increased another 10km! And this is now in the present day, as a write this. You're all caught up. And to top it off, an old lumber axe was lying on the grass ~4km from my starting position. So i used this opportunity to cut down some of the unlimited trees and create a little hut for shelter. I mean, theres no animals, not yet at least, but the rain's not an issue now.

Day 30, An expedition SW ~5km found me a button with similar runes to the device found on day 8. What do ya know, they fit together perfectly. Like ying and yang. 
Maybe if i write them on this page and then hold them near the reciever..

Huh, the light went of- OH, It's purple now? Green? Gone..
..
Oh.. Sh-

Day 31, Something arrived from the sky it was.. something, like a venator from Star Wars but wrong.. A Covenant supercarrier from Halo mixed in maybe. But it scanned me or something, and i just ran. But instead of a loop i found my house. No signs of life, No dog, No family, No plants. Nothing.
Thats when i heard a smaller craft land outside, I locked myself in my room, clutching a BB Gun i had from the Airsoft training a few days ago, or.. i guess before all this that is.

Day..?, Theres more.
Cant write much
Must Hide.

day.
wriggling, squirming, squeltching, different, new, dangeros?
Food all gone, water low. Feeling woozy.

..days?..
They left me alone. They left. I went to the fridge after it was safe and thank god there was food, it was perfectly fine, too. Not out of date. The digital clock hanging on the wall displayed the same date as the time i left my friends. 
24th May, 2022.
The same.
The time though..
2:46..
Only ten minutes had passed? surely not..

new day new.. hope to be lost

I give up. They're back again. All i hear is wriggling and squirming like the flood from Halo, the piter patter of not my dog in my normal home safe and sound, but a creature horrifyingly distorted and deformed. Not from sight, but from sound alone.

i give.. up.

They're outside. Banging on the door. They want to be in i can hear them faintly chant
"come with us, we are the light, come with us, we are the end"
They're going to get in i know it. its just when, why is this happening why does this happen to m\~-/~~-
                                                                                 \-/


25th May, 2022. The Maywood incident
--------------------------------------------------------------
1500 hours. [REDACTED] Maywood was found dead in his room after being missing for a day. His friends said that they were socializing at the nearby park when he took an unusual turn than normal, turning to the Remyaw Plains, a section of the town said to be cursed. And when they looked back, [REDACTED] Maywood was gone.
No signs of injury were found on the body, however internal organs were completely gutted and flung all over the room. Investigations are still underway and questions being answered to the best of our ability.
A journal was found next to the body, however there are no records of any journals being bought by the individual. the contents are currently being deciphered, as they are in runes unknown. All we can read is a few words, in english, that read:
"SUBJECT READY, COMMENCE." At the end, the writing seems to be interupted by something, like their hand was moved mid sentence.

It’s the same every time.

First is Sodium Thiopental. An anesthetic; ultrashort-action barbiturate. Some’ll tell you that it’s this that kills them, that it’s this that puts them under and they’ve got no idea what happens next. I beg to differ. Men still whimper after the anesthetic, you can still hear their shallow sobs, half-mumbled prayers. I think this step is more for us than anything, to give us the illusion we’re doing a good thing. To give the impression that all of this, the dim lighting, the smell of bleach and vomit, the doctors smoking as they wait by the body bag, is *humane.*

Then saline solution to flush the line. This is important, any contamination and the chemicals could react, you risk fumbling the execution, which can lead to an appeal, or the subject walking free. Always remember to flush the line.

Second is Pancuronium Bromide, a paralyzing agent, this stops breathing, paralyzing the diaphragm and lungs. You can hear this one. Like someone’s holding their body in a vice, their breaths get more strained, raspier, you can hear the spittle drying in their throat, on their chin. No more prayers.

Saline solution, flush the line again. Always remember to flush the line.

Third, and last, is Potassium Chloride, a toxic agent. Sure, they wouldn’t have a great chance at living anyway, but this is what *really* kills them. It induces cardiac arrest, their body seizes, shakes, strains against the leather and plastic holding them in place.

Within a minute or two, they’re declared dead.

I’ve been a state executioner for a while now, coming on 5 years. It’s decent pay, sure, and as there aren’t many who’re willing to do it, who’re willing to get really up close and personal you’ll often find that you’ve got a choice of where you want to live. If a state has the death penalty, and administers the injection, chances are there’ll be work for you there.

For me it’s always come from a deep personal sense of justice. I was robbed of the chance at a normal life when I was just a boy. The media fetishised it, called it *the perfect crime,* and TV was flooded with men and women who would say things like *whilst of course, I cannot condone the murders nor would I ever want to, there is a strange and perverse genius to them….a sense that a truly intelligent mind is behind this...*

I’d had to grow up hearing that, called onto talk shows when my voice had barely broken, asked to comment on the deranged genius behind the death of my family, the symbolism of the way he’d flayed their skin, asked if I had any clue what the words on the wall meant.

I didn’t, if you’re curious.

In my mind there was no genius behind it, nothing symbolic: it was what it was. A man had broken into my home whilst I wasn’t there, killed and dismembered those I held dear, pinning their skin to the wall, like taxidermy models, or butterflies in glass cases.

There had been things that had seemed strange, sure. The fact that in this series of murders he’d always write what the police were about to do before they did it, on the walls. Sometimes in blood, sometimes in black ink. Things like:

15:29 OFFICER NORTON ENTERS BUILDING.

15:30 NORTON EXCLAIMS: HOLY SHIT.

15:31 NORTON RETCHES

15:34 CALLS FOR BACK UP

Sometimes there’d be little clips of speech, and first responders would swear that they were exactly what they’d said. I chalked this up to suggestible minds, to people not knowing what the fuck they’re meant to think when they see a family of five cut apart in their living room. They’d want to misremember, to align their narrative with something bigger.

They never caught him. They tried, but every single time he was one step ahead. They’d arrive at hotel rooms a day too late, decipher clues hours after the deadline.

There were parts too, they didn’t mention. Darker things: insane ramblings, pages from notebooks with these strange drawings, figures reaching out past the page, rambling interior monologues: *it comes and it comes and there is nothing we can do we are stuck it comes we are stuck move back to move forward it comes there is nothing we can do i am alone we are alone nothing we can do the cycle continues the cycle marches on unchanged always nothing we can do*

There were vague connections between the families targeted. It wasn’t just mine, although they were the first. I’d known the victims' families, memories that refused to show themselves no matter how much I tried. I remembered big get-togethers, the adults laughing and drunk, attending Church together, services spoken in tongues, candles and glyphs and songs in Latin.

Once I heard they’d finally caught him I transferred straight away. More than a decade of waiting, and there was a chance I’d be the one to put the injection in. To, in my own way, have justice for what was done to me, and those I loved that night. There were concerns of course, and those who knew of my history tried to talk me out of it, but I was owed favours. Everyone in our field is owed favours. Turn a blind eye here, sign there, you’d  be surprised what we let happen.

I remember how he looked. How all these years I’d imagined him as a monster: hideous, slavering, desperate. I watched for a while through the one way glass. He seemed familiar, the slope of his nose, the way he let his mouth come to rest. Even though I know they’re mirrors I swear to God he saw me too, and smiled. Broad, exposing yellow teeth.

Maybe I’d pictured him all these years so intensely, every night in my dreams and every morning when I steeled myself for work, I couldn’t see it in his face. Part of me just was not able to see it.

He had a strange air about him: this sense of calm that only he disturbed. As if nothing around him could affect him because whatever had a hold over him was inside. His eyes were dark. He’d occasionally look around the room, close his eyes for a second, say something, before opening them again. Like he was checking for something.

They usually have to wear hoods, but I’d made a special request to keep his off. So I could see his eyes roll back and turn white. Who was going to tell? He’d be zipped in a cheap body bag in 15 minutes and everyone here had other shit to be getting on with.

I left my hood outside as well. Entered.

I had it all prepared, what I’d say when I saw him, the cool and detached way I’d deliver it, as if this didn’t mean the world to me, as if he and his crimes were nothing and I’d risen above them but as soon as I entered they caught in my throat.

The guards on either side of him waited.

He licked his lips.

“Jack.”

I wanted to speak, to reply, but I was powerless. A boy again, nervous and sobbing held by arms I didn’t know, not allowed into my own home but asked questions, *no* I don’t know if my mother and father had debts, *no* I don’t know who my next of kin is, *no* I don’t know why someone might want to hurt them. Asking to see my parents over and over again because I was so scared and I needed them, and every time being told I couldn’t and I wasn’t sure why but I knew that the panic rising in my stomach wasn’t good, couldn’t be good-

He continued speaking:

“You look old - older.”

I told him I was here to administer his lethal injection. That in less than ten minutes he would be dead.

He rolled his eyes. Was he *enjoying* this?

I tried to be professional, if I couldn’t speak I could at least do my job, could at least kill him.

I fumbled the needle for a moment, and it fell onto the floor. I had never, in all my years, fumbled before. Never. It was a point of pride for me: steady hands.  My heart stopped for a moment, but the casing was still on. I could breathe. As I came up I met his eye again.

“You always do that.”

A beat.

He continued: “every time.”

As if he knew what I was going to do before I did it. As if, I thought for a brief moment, he'd done this before.

He started speaking as I pushed the anesthetic in, and I thought for a moment it was a prayer. But when I began to be able to pick up words, in the sterile silence of that room, I realised he was speaking to me. It was like he'd have moments of lucidity and then lapse into madness again:

“Good luck, Jack” he was saying “it’s up to you now and it’s over for me and I’m so glad I’m so glad I’m free and I’m so sorry I’m so sorry Jack it’s you now no choice you’ll know when you know and it’s you now Jack, it’s always you it’s always us-”

His words were cut short. He bit his tongue. The Bromide had entered his blood stream, his lungs and diaphragm stopped working. I could hear the last of the air leak from his mouth, his throat. He jerked back, and with his last breath his head lolled back, as if relaxing, and I swear to God he smiled.

I went home feeling strange. Unfulfilled. I’d thought this would be it, that after this my life would be somehow fixed, that days would seem brighter and the evenings longer and less lonely, but there was nothing. The trailer park I lived in stunk just as bad, roaches still scattered when I turned on the light, and I was still empty.

Maybe, I thought, it was because of the way he’d acted. As if he’d *wanted* to be caught. As if this was some game.

Maybe it was what he said, somehow implicating me in all of this. I could still hear his monologue, rambling and repetitive but somehow so *urgent.* So *desperate.*

I knew it was true. He hadn’t just wanted to be caught, he’d wanted to *die.*

Mark called. A friend from the prison. He knew the execution was today, was checking in.

“Rough day, huh?”

“Sure. Yeah.”

“Heard it was a weird one for you, Jack.”

I sighed, he’d probably heard about the weird monologue, about the repetition, about the fact he knew my name.

“Yeah, it was. He knew my name, kept rambling in these weird whispers, said it was me now, and he was free and-” I paused. Took a breath. “It was fucked, man. It was fucked.”

Mark seemed confused.

“I didn’t know about that.”

My heart skipped a beat. Why had he called if not that?

“The guys said it must have been a hard execution for you.”

“Why’s that?”

“You don’t know?

Jack, they said the guy looked just like [you](https://www.reddit.com/r/Max_Voynich/).”

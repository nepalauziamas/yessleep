&#x200B;

October is here at last and in spite of everything, I’m still excited about it. Last post, I mentioned that I kept the skull of that shapeshifter. Since then, I’ve put it to good use as a candle holder. Yeah, I got some black and red candles and stuck them into the sockets. We even painted it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The left side along with its antler being the former color with the right side and the corresponding antler being the latter color. Even Stevenson agrees it looks pretty damn cool. Among other things, we made a sugar cookie pizza I saw in my dream. Good ones have been rare for me lately, so I took it as a sign. I topped it with Nutella, peanut butter, and strawberry jam.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I also baked chocolate chip cookies topped with peanut butter. This year, I’m hoping to get baking a pumpkin pie down. I keep burning the freaking things. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. If anyone could give me some advice on that or hell, even link a sure-fire recipe even an idiot like me could make, I’d appreciate it. Anyway, talking about my cooking ventures is fun and all, but I guess I should move on to more important matters.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Namely, that card tree we have in the basement. None of us could've guessed what Stevenson found out about it. Early in the morning at breakfast, he came up to call us down and get a slice of the quiche I made.  His expression made it apparent that whatever he wanted us to see had shaken him. We followed him and there it lay on Carl's workbench.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Multiple tools were beside it that was covered in thick blue liquid which was presumably its blood. Seeing all this was pretty offputting.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Okay, so besides making yourself seem like a demented surgeon, why are you showing us this?” Carl asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Stevenson, slightly annoyed, replied.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Just watch."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He proceeded to use some tools to pry what I will loosely refer to as its lips apart. We could hear some ear-piercing awful noises as he did. It was like listening to countless people being tortured at once. My arms broke out in goosebumps. It was like listening to someone open up a can of what the fuck.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

As the anguished wood around its mouth that I will loosely be referring to as its lips was parting, there was a faint white light. When they were fully opened, we could see a glowing swirling mass within. It got so bright it was nearly blinding until Stevenson removed the tools, making it close.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Warn us to wear sunglasses next time," Carl snapped at him.

&#x200B;

"The hell was that?" I asked, rubbing my eyes.

&#x200B;

"I believe it's some kind of portal," Stevenson replied. "I've stuck different tools inside and it doesn't seem to have an end."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This was shocking news.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"So then they must've eaten everyone," Nick said.

&#x200B;

"I don't know if "eat" is the right word, more like consumed. Either way, by doing so these things have most likely sent your friends and my colleagues far away, maybe to another universe. Hell, even to another dimension for all we know."

&#x200B;

"To Inde's home?" I asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This was a harrowing thought. If everyone was there, it meant they might've seen it, and if that’s the case,  they’d be as good as dead already. Then again if there’s a word that can be used to describe our townspeople it’s resilient. We’ll never know until we finally go to where they are. The most obvious obstacle to our goal is that we don’t have any reliable way to fight Inde.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“That’s gonna be a bitch,” Carl said. “Maybe we’re going  about this the wrong way.”

&#x200B;

“Meaning what?” Nick replied.

&#x200B;

“We’re thinking about this like we’re going to fight Inde and to be honest, I think that’s fucking stupid.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We couldn’t argue with him there.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“What we should do is get them out as quickly and quietly as possible,” Carl continued.

&#x200B;

“Great, because the last rescue mission we were on went so smoothly,” I said.  “Oh well, I guess we’ll just have to hope our luck stays strong.”

&#x200B;

“That’s the spirit.”

&#x200B;

“Great,” Nick yawned, “but how do we even know the card trees will take us there?”

&#x200B;

“We could lower a camera in,” Stevenson suggested. “Then again that may be a bit risky depending on what it shows us. If only we knew someone who could tell us more about it.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The only person we could think of that would fit that bill was Zohl and we didn’t have a clue where he was.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Maybe we should try the library again,” I said. “I don’t think we’ve finished exploring it.”

&#x200B;

“Now that you mention it, there are those symbols we found in the back,” Carl replied. “I wonder if the book mentions anything about them?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We flipped through it and eventually found the symbols among the invisible ink portion. From what we gathered, they seemed to be used for performing some kind of ritual after dark as indicated by the drawn stars.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Of course, it has to be at night," Nick complained. "What does it even do anyway?"

&#x200B;

"Something important I bet," I told him. "Why else would Alice risk her life to try it?"

&#x200B;

“Hang on. I don’t think that’s all of it,” Stevenson spoke up.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He pointed to the end of the page and noted a shape that seemed to be connecting to something else. Sure enough, he was right. The following three pages showed that the symbols we saw initially were part of four sets, meaning to complete it we’d have to set up the other three. While initially, we thought that wouldn’t be that difficult, we soon realized this wasn’t going to be the case. The main challenge to that was shown on the following fourth page,

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

On it were all the symbol sets with a note saying they had to be when converted from metrics at least half a mile apart and then somehow connected together.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“So we have to do all this while those card trees are attacking us?” Nick asked.

&#x200B;

“Pretty much,” I said.

&#x200B;

“Well, could we maybe put down some suites first so they can’t get us?”

&#x200B;

“There’d still be openings for them to get through.”

&#x200B;

“Oh, right, guess we better weapon up then.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The plan was to do it as early in the night as possible. Stevenson would be completing the one at the library and then pick us up once we did ours. We each made sure to copy down the symbols so we’d get them right. Plus, we bought some extra hand radios and offerings to place in the circle’s centers. Nick was at the power plant.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Carl was at the town hall and I was at Formaggio’s.  We need something roughly at the center of all these places and that happened to be the stand containing statues of presumably our town’s founders. We don’t know much about them and the plaque is too faded to read properly.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Alright, is everyone ready?” Carl asked through the speaker.

&#x200B;

“As ever,” I replied.

&#x200B;

“Yep,” Nick said.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Glancing up from my spot, I could see the setting sun here at last and the all too familiar dread crept within me once more.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Let’s hurry this up,” Stevenson told us.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We did so, drawing the symbols fast and placing our objects within them. It couldn’t be any objects, however. It had to carry some significance. For example, the pen on the first set was one Alice used a lot. Carl used an old knife he owned since he was a kid.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Nick used an old shirt of his and I used my old Gamecube controller which contained a lot of teeth marks. I placed it in the center and waited. For what? I wasn’t sure. Then a bright orange light shot from both sides of my symbols set.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Do you guys see this light too?” I asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

They told me they did and that the offerings were acting strange.  I choked on mine and much to my dismay it seemed to be melting. While this did give me some heartache, I knew it was a necessary sacrifice.  The others reported the same thing was happening to them. Everything was going smoothly so far which naturally meant shit was about to hit the fan.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Even though we knew this all too well, that didn’t stop the panic from crawling in. The first few card trees were emerging from the woods. I told everyone this and they informed me they were seeing them too.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“How long do we have to hold them off for?” Nick inquired.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

According to the ritual, once all symbol sets were created it wouldn’t be complete until the line was fully connected.  If any of the sets were damaged it would stop everything so we had to prevent that for the next ten minutes. This was easier said than done especially when we were swarmed with card trees. From the front, about four approached me which I shot down. Then ten came from my left and right side which I also shot.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The thing is as prepared as we could get, we each could only carry so much. When pulling the triggers of my guns was met with clicking, I switched to my crossbow. This put me at a significant disadvantage since I couldn’t attack as fast. Back before our training, my hands would be shaking in a situation like this. However, Carl taught us to separate fear from action.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I ducked and sidestepped swinging branches. Some tried to grab my legs. I cut them away. Then I noticed one was getting too close to my symbol set. I dove at it with my knife out and leaped onto its back, stabbing repeatedly. It screamed in pain.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Then it spoke and what it said was chilling.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Thank you…”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Caught off guard by this, I failed to react in time to some more branches swinging at me. There was only time to gasp before one hit me. I let out a grunt of pain and was sent flying through the broken window of Formaggio’s and into an overturned table. Groaning, I pulled out my radio.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"How are things coming along for you guys?" I asked, gritting my teeth as I was trying to fight through the pain shooting through me.

&#x200B;

"I managed to climb up a tree, but the fuckers have me stuck," Carl replied.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Nick, breathing heavily, spoke next.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Why are there so many? I've been running like a maniac and more keep-."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He yelled and an audible thump sounded over the speaker.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Nick, are you alright?" I said, getting concerned.

&#x200B;

"For now."

&#x200B;

"Good, what about you, Stevenson?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

When he didn't respond I got a bad feeling. I heard him screaming off in the distance and didn't have to see what was going on to know it wasn't anything good. He did respond.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"They're looking for me inside," he whispered. "I'm hiding in the restroom."

&#x200B;

"How did you mess that up?" Carl chastised him.  "The only thing you had to do was wait inside and not draw attention to yourself."

&#x200B;

"I was startled. There were some flashing lights above the library that caught me off guard.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

As I was trying to think of what that could be, the card trees were coming in. Scrambling to my feet, I dashed for the back exit only to find more bursting in from there as well. At that moment, I wondered to myself why we didn’t paint suites on the buildings. It was too late. I was surrounded and despite my best efforts of slashing and stabbing, they had me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Guys,” I screamed into my radio as I was being dragged away, ”they got me.”

&#x200B;

“Pete, no,” Nick yelled.

&#x200B;

“We’ll be over there soon,” Carl said. “Hang on.”

&#x200B;

The branches wrapped over my entire body. It was suffocating and wriggled desperately in a vain effort to free myself. Eventually, my body succumbed and I passed out. I woke later with a gasp, finding myself bound to a tree and so were the others. They were tied to trees near mine.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“You guys got captured too?” I croaked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My heart sank, knowing not one of us was able to get away.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Oh no,” Stevenson responded, “We just thought it’d be a good idea to take a walk in the woods full of things that are going to eat us. Yes, we were captured.”

&#x200B;

“Ah, shut up,” Carl told him. “We’re in this mess because you fucked up. You had the easiest part of all this, but you got scared by some damn lights.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Before he could reply, our captors returned.  We were helpless against the card trees and ny stomach turned at the sight of them. Something we’d been wondering is why they bothered dragging their victims into the woods as opposed to consuming them as soon as they were caught. The answer was that it seemed they needed to perform some kind of ritual first.  Actually, it was more of a dance.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

They did it in rhythm, circling around us. Honestly, if they weren’t a bunch of abominations of nature intending on consuming us, it would’ve been kind of majestic. We tried to get free. However, none of us could move freely. The card trees were chanting something.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The language was ancient and gravelly Hearing it made my skin crawl. All at once, they stopped and faced us. Their mouths opened wide, shining blue light onto us. Sounds come from them, screams of anguish and despair. Their branches shot forward, slicing away our restraints and then ensnaring us once again.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

They lifted us up, dangling us over their open maws. This was it. A distant part of my mind was wondering if this is what everyone else in town had seen before they were eaten. If this were the case, then our hopes of them being okay were dashed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Guys,” I groaned.

&#x200B;

“Yeah?” Nick said, panic clear in his voice.

&#x200B;

“Sorry.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The others were silent. We were pulled forward, only able to stare while awaiting our harrowing fate. We were inches away from them when suddenly something flew towards us, slicing through their branches. We dropped to the ground hard. My muscles ached due to how long we were still.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

As I was getting up, my bones popped and we could now see many arrows sticking out of the card trees. When they fell over, our savior was revealed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Apologies for not assisting sooner, I needed to make preparations.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Our faces broke into grins.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Zohl,” Carl, Nick, and I exclaimed at once.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He was back and unchanged except that his suit was now blue with a white tie.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Come, we need should discuss matters somewhere safer.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He helped us back to Carl’s place and shortly later, we were all sitting on the couch together.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“A curse, hm? Well, it sounds like you’ve had quite the eventful past couple of years,” he told us.

“Yeah. but we got these crystals that keep it at bay,” Carl said. “Good thing too. What we're dealing with now is bad enough on its own.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I can imagine. Incidentally, that man has been staring at me for nearly six minutes straight.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He pointed to Stevenson. He’d been that way since the walk back.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I’ve never seen a real-life alien before,” he whispered.

&#x200B;

“And now you have, so what do you think of me?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Those words were like opening a damn. A torrent of questions poured from Stevenson, asking about his powers and technology.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Settle down,” I said to Stevenson. “He literally just got back. Give the guy time to relax. Wait, you are a guy, right? I don’t think we’ve ever asked.”

&#x200B;

“My species doesn’t recognize the concept of gender. Refer to me as you wish.”

&#x200B;

“Okay. so as I was saying, give him time to breathe before you jump down his throat with questions.”

&#x200B;

“Where have you been anyway?” Nick inquired of Zohl.

&#x200B;

“It’s a long story. I will tell it. However, I need to rest after such a long journey.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He was preaching to the choir. We were exhausted by the night’s events. He’s sleeping out in his ship which he promised to show us. I am fucking pumped about that. I finally get to see the inside of it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

More good news is that when I told him about I thought saving everyone would be impossible, he told me I may be wrong so I guess there’s hope after all. We’ll know what he means soon. On that note, I better get to [sleep.](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesFromRose/)

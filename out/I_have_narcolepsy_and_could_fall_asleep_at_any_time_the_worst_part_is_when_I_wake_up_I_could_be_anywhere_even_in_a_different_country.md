 

I was diagnosed with narcolepsy last year when I suddenly started falling asleep at work, I didn’t think it was a big deal at the time. The only reason I went to the doctor at all was to save myself from getting fired, my boss thought I was on drugs because it happened sometimes mid-sentence. Anyway, back then I only dozed off for a few seconds at a time and always woke up in the same place. The only bad thing was I lost my driver's license and my wife had to drive me to work, which she was not happy about. I love my wife more than anything and she does have a good heart, deep down, but she can get moody when things don’t go her way. 

Every journey with her from, and to work for the first two weeks was hell, I don’t know why she took it out on me, it's not like I got narcolepsy on purpose, but try explaining that to her. She is one of those people that always finds a way to blame everyone else for what's wrong in her life, even when it’s her own fault, like the time she ran me over. One day she complained of black smoke coming out of her exhaust pipe and asked me to check it out, when I told her I couldn’t see anything she revved the engine. Unfortunately, it was in reverse at the time, she must have knocked me 10 feet, luckily, I went straight through that timber fence and got away with a few minor cuts and bruises. 

She blamed me for the whole thing, her argument was I shouldn’t have been standing there in the first place. I could barely walk for a week after that and all she was worried about was the dent in her bumper, she even made me take it in to get fixed. So, you can imagine what I had to put up with when she had to drive to the other side of the country for me.  

It wasn’t too bad in the early stages I didn’t go too far, maybe a different room or something like that, it was kind of funny my wife was convinced I was trying to prank her all the time. For me the joke was over when I woke up in the middle of town half naked on a Sunday morning, after mass. It was so embarrassing my wife had to pick me up at the police station. When I tried to convince her that I just woke up like that she got so angry, she didn’t talk to me for a week after it. 

She only started to believe me when she witnessed it for herself as she was driving me to work one day, she was stopped at a traffic light when she dropped her phone down beside her seat. Within the 10 seconds it took for her to find it, I was gone. That was the weird thing, it only seemed to happen when no one was looking. 

When I first realized that we tried everything to prevent it from happening, from tying me onto the bed and locking me in my room to putting up security cameras, but it never worked, the moment no one was looking I'd be gone. When we looked back over the footage nothing would show up only a black screen.  

Every time it happened it took me a little further, until eventually it became too far for my wife to drive. I had to tape my passport and wallet to my leg, so I'd have money for a hotel room and food until I found a way home, it was costing so much money we had to take out a second mortgage. 

Even though I never knew when it would happen, it could have been a day, a week, once I went a whole month without any incidents. I did notice some sort of order in the direction I was going and was sometimes able to predict roughly where I would wake up. I realized every 3rd jump I would end up going in the same direction as the first, but maybe a couple of hundred miles or so ahead. Here is my problem, two jumps ago I ended up in south Korea at the edge of the north Korean border, I'll give you one guess where I will end up next. I don’t know how I am going to tell my wife.

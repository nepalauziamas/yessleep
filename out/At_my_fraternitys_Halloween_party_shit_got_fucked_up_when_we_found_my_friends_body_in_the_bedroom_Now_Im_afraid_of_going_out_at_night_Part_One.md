Full moon, flashing lights, loud ass music, beer, pot, and the hottest girls on campus. Every college boy's dream, right? That was the "Knuckle-biter Empire's" Halloween party.

This was all of course, Ronnie’s idea. Ronald Edmunds, "Knuckle-biter Supreme and ruler of parties and chicks!" In case you haven't picked up on it yet, yes, we're just a bunch of dumbass frat boys. Parties once a month and football games every Friday night during the winter. The three of us; Me, Ronnie, Zack and Wydell, were about the most obnoxious frat on campus at Western State University, and we couldn't have cared less. 

When we weren't at football games like I mentioned, ogling the cheerleaders, or trying to (and usually failing to) score with the chicks at Ronnie's house parties, we were usually spending our time coming up with the most extreme stunts and pranks to pull off on the campus. And when I say extreme, we're not just talking simple spray painting "Suck it" on the Dean's car (though we did do that once) or hooking up a car battery to the seat in one of the bathrooms so the next unlucky son of a bitch would be on the hot seat when he needed to drop one. No, we're talking more like actually filling up and attempting to light off a potpourri of firecrackers un the trunk of Wydell's old piece of shit Ford pickup that was constantly breaking down every two times you went to turn the damn thing on and watching it go out with a blast on the campus football field. Either that, or at the very least trying to dare random people to run across campus in broad daylight bare assed with lit sparklers in their hands, shouting "*Long live Knuckle-biter Supreme!"*

Yes, we were idiots and yes, we probably should've been arrested a few times. To answer as to why we haven't ever been (since I know you're wondering), well, let me emphasize the word *ATTEMPT.* See, the downside was, next to none of these stunts *actually* worked like we wanted them to. People of course weren't interested in making a quick 20 bucks by running across campus in the buff and the one time we actually tried the car bomb on the soccer field act, the damn things were fucking duds. In short, we were wannabe hotshots, even if we couldn't ever pull off half the insane and dangerous shit we came up with on the regular. 

I know that was kind of a lot, but now you know who we were, and why this whole mess has turned things every which way from loose for me. So anyway, like I said, we were at Ronnie's party. Me and Zack were both nice and stoned with the bowl he brought while watching Wydell dance -- or at least *try* to -- in the middle of the living room with a few of the girls while Ronnie was in the kitchen, nursing his high with as much of the chips and junk food as he could stuff in his mouth. As the two of us watched, Zack turned to me and said, "God man, just imagine."

"What, dude?" I asked. He pointed to the girls gathered around Wydell. 

"Imagine yourself, right there, with all them rubbing up against you like that." I looked and snickered.

"Yeah."

"Hey, Wydell, back room's all yours!" he called out. Wydell glared at him, still continuing to do his little shaking thing that I guess was supposed to count as him dancing. I think he was actually about to stop and walk off somewhere else when one of the girls, an albeit drop-dead *gorgeous* babe that had both mine and Zack's eyes bugging from their sockets, stopped him. She was tall, meeting Wydell, who was the tallest of us "Knuckle-biters" at 6', at eye level. She was slim, too, forming an almost perfect hourglass shape from her shoulders to her hips. Wydell was thinking the same thing, too, judging from the way in which his eyes were about to shoot out of his own head. 

She winked, bit her lip and playfully took his hand, gesturing to the back bedroom of Ronnie's house. Wydell stood still, looking caught off guard. I, being the good ol' pal I was, decided to egg him on, going "Wy-dell! Wy-dell! Wy-dell!" Soon, Zack and a few of the others around him joined in. He looked absolutely embarrassed and it was hilarious. Of course, I couldn't blame him. 

Of the four of us, Wydell was always the one we'd expect to always strike out with the ladies. I mean, *none* of us were realn "Top notch" catches as far as that went, I'll admit. But Wydell had always been the responsible, or at least the *most* responsible "Knuckle-biter". It was at least 51% of the reason we had him hanging out with us. While the other three of us were doing shit that'd get us (and probably others if we're being honest) killed, Wydell would be the one that'd be there so that we'd have at least a *slight* chance at surviving whatever stupid stunt we were trying to pull off at any given moment. Funny how that works, I guess.

Well anyway, there he was, presented with this golden opportunity and what does he do? He stands there, jaw hanging open like an idiot. A few other girls, all just as hot as the one in front of him, then come up and take his other hand with sly smiles of their own. Eventually they managed to coax him to move and they led him all the way to the back room. "Attaboy! Get 'em, Wy-guy!" I shouted. 

I heard the door close and everyone turned down the music and tried to listen closely. We couldn't hear anything. We figured, you know, he's probably nervous. Like I said, it *was* his first time. Eventually, though, interest in this started to fade after about 5 or so minutes with absolutely nothing happening and the music was turned back up. Another ten or twenty minutes went by before Ronnie came back into the living room.

 "Hey, what's going on? I miss something?" Zack and I grinned. 

"Bro, you missed Wydell scoring with chicks!" I exclaimed. His eyes grew.

"You're bullshitting!"

"No dude." Zack said, "Ask anyone here, they'll tell you." He looked around at the crowd and back to the two of us. "You'd be proud."

"Who was it?" he asked, still looking skeptical. I shrugged. 

"Don't know. It was this really cute chick and a couple of her friends. I haven't ever seen them before. I don't even think they're actually from the campus." His eyes got even bigger with shock.

"*Friends?!*" he exclaimed. "You mean to tell me he actually landed more than one at the same time!" Zack and I both nodded, grinning excitedly. He stared in shock for another moment before his face fell into one of outrage. "Hold up, you mean to tell me that fucker's gettin' it on *before* I had my turn?! The fuck!" 

"Aw, lighten up, dude." Zack chided. "You've had all this time to have your shot and you decided to pig out in the kitchen."

 I shrugged in agreement and told him, "You stay quiet, you bite it." It was our little credo. It was supposed to mean something similar to "YOLO", you know? You get one shot, you better take it, basically. Of course, this didn't mean shit to him. 

That was always a big sort of unspoken rule between the 'Knuckle-biter Empire' when it came to parties. We could have as much fun with whatever girl we managed to get lucky with that night in the back room, for however long we liked, so long as he got the first session. It was sort of own little "Bro-code" type thing, even if we weren't exactly big on the idea. We didn't usually oppose it. But I figured, like Zack said, he'd had all that time, PLUS it was Wydell's first ever -- you'd think he'd have been willing to cut *a little* slack, right? 

Ronnie started stomping off toward the back room. Zack and I braced ourselves to have to hear him scream at the top of his lungs at Wydell. We heard him shout "What the fuck!" I could tell something was off, though. "Oh God, what the fuck!" 

Zack and I looked at each other alarmed before jumping up from the couch and running for the back room. Zack reached the room ahead of me. "Dude, what's wro-- OH MY GOD!" 

I made it the rest of the way to the room and instantly felt sick to my stomach. The bed was torn and cut up, every inch covered in rips and slashes. Also covered in these from head to toe, almost to the point where I couldn't even recognize him, was Wydell, who was gasping and wheezing, even coughing up spurts of blood. On the wall, as well as on his chest and both his palms, was a pentagram. "Wydell!" I cried, pushing past the other two and rushing over to the bed. Zack turned and retched while Ronnie just stood frozen in the doorway. 

Wydell weakly spasmed while spitting out bigger and bigger spurts of blood. "Wy, stay with me, man!" I turned to the others and shouted, "What the fuck are you standing there for?! GO! get 911 on the phone!" 

"We can't, dude!" Ronnie exclaimed.

"What do you mean "We can't?"

"Dude, are you *trying* to get us busted!" He held up the joint he had behind his ear. 

"He's gonna fucking *DIE* if we don't!" He still remained stiff. "Dude, trust me, this is a hell of a lot worse than a fucking possession charge. Get the ambulance on the phone, NOW!" I stared wildly at him, making it clear that I was gonna put my foot in his ass if he didn't. Reluctantly, yet desperately, he ran back into the living room to call 911 while also clearing out the rest of the guests. 

"Zack, grab me a towel." He ran to the bathroom and came back with an old dirty towel. "Here, help me plug his wound."

"Which one?" he asked. I looked around. I almost wasn't sure, given how much his body had been ripped up. Finally, I told him to wrap it around the pentagram on his chest. I carefully them tried performing CPR. I didn't know what else to do, besides that and trying to prop his head up. Never really had much knowledge of First Aid. Sure enough, this at least got him to stop coughing up blood. He continued wheezing. 

"What happened, dude?" Zack asked Wydell, as if he was gonna actually be able to answer that. Wydell's gasped harder and harder, like he was actually *trying* to speak. Nothing came out, though. 

Ronnie came running back into the room. "Okay, they're on their way. Is he gonna be--"

"Don't know yet. Is everybody else gone?"

"Yeah." Wydell's body began to relax and his eyes started to glaze over with his head lolling limply to one side. 

"Wy!" I said, shaking him gently. "Wydell, come on man, stay with me!" I could feel his chest relaxing under my hands. He wasn't gonna make it much longer. I started shaking him harder. "Wydell! WYDELL!" 

I then resorted again to chest compressions, stopping every 10 to 15 seconds to give him mouth to mouth. Nothing seemed to be working. His heartbeat was so faint by that point that I almost didn't feel it, despite how hard I was pressing. In what I considered to be a true stroke of luck, almost even the work of a miracle, I heard the sirens outside. 

"That's them," Ronnie said, "I'll let them in." He and Zack then rushed out of the room into the living room, leaving me alone with a rapidly fading Wydell. Ten seconds later, paramedics flooded the room and told me they'd handle it from there. I was led out of the room while they started trying to prep him to be moved. 

My mind was wrecked, to say the least. I mean, one moment, shit's fine and dandy, my friend's about to get his first lucky night with a couple of hot chicks, and just 15 or 20 minutes later, he was choking on his own blood after having been mauled by what must've been a big ass wolverine or something. This alone was enough to put me into a frenzy, obviously, but what stuck out to me even more were, of course, the pentagrams. Now, I'm no kind of religious nut by any stretch -- I grew up atheist -- but I wasn't born yesterday. I'd seen shit like this both online and on TV. I knew what a human sacrifice looked like. 

Not only this, but I also saw the window wide open in the room while I was trying to revive Wydell. One thing I knew for a fact was that Ronnie never opened that window, usually so he could keep the weed fumes contained whenever he was having one of his turns with the back room. And because I also knew no one else was in there at the time, I knew this had to do with those girls. They did that to him and then fled out the window, disappearing into the night. 

That much was certain to me, even then, with my brain scrambling worse than a pan of eggs. What *wasn't* making sense to me was why and/or even how. Okay, so maybe the chicks were part of some crazy murder cult or something. Again, that'd (maybe) explain the pentagrams. But even still, though, how the hell could they have done *that* to him?!

Wydell was then rushed off to the hospital as police then arrived at the house. The rest of that night was spent being interrogated by the police. We tried telling them the same thing I've been saying here; that we don't know shit about what went in in that room, but it was still another 4 or 5 hours of them assaulting us with questions before they finally let us go home. Zack, Ronnie and I split up from there; with them (at least I assume) going back to the campus while I decided to head to the hospital to check up on Wydell.

Admittedly, I wasn't sure what I was supposed to expect, other than to hear that he didn't even make it there. I guess it was a relief then that I stood corrected when they told me he'd actually stabilized. The doctors told me he was asleep and had been for the past 3 hours. "We almost lost him." the doctor added, chuckling dryly. "But whatever your boy's on, it's some powerful stuff."

"What do you mean?" I asked him. 

"Well, you saw him, right? Losing as much blood as he did, plus several slashed tendons and even one or two slashed arteries, he should've bit it before we could get him on the table. But he's still kicking, sleeping now like a baby." He chuckled again when he said this. I stared confused at him. "Sorry, wasn't meaning any disrespect, just astonished by it, that's all."

"Yeah, okay, whatever, can I see him?" He looked at his watch. 

"'Fraid not, pal." he said, looking up at me, tapping his watch. "Come back in about 6 hours." With that, I turned and left back towards the campus. On the way, I texted Ronnie and Zack, telling them Wydell had made it and was okay. Ronnie texted back.

**-- "Thank god! What do U think could've happened?"**

I texted back, telling him "Fuck if I knew."

**-- "He must've** ***really*** **wanted it rough, huh?"**

\-- "Dude, what the fuck! Our boy is put in the hospital and you're making jokes?"

**-- "Sorry... Seriously, though, who were those chicks anyway? You know 'em?"**

\-- "No, man, I told you, I've never seen them before. I don't think they're even from the college."

**-- "Then how'd they find my place? I mean, you know our Halloween party was "Invite only", right?"**

I stopped. There was another enigma, one I never even considered before then. He was right, we, or at least me and Ronnie, had only told a select few people that we were even having that party at his house that night. And whoever we *did* allow on the guest list, we made sure all four of us knew about it. We also explicitly stated the whole "Invite only" thing to the guests, meaning that they weren't allowed to bring anyone else in on it, either. Well, again, that's how me and Ronnie did, anyways.

That led me to wonder then, who, if not me or Ronnie, knew them and invited them? The only options were either A, Wydell himself, or B, Zack. I told this to Ronnie. 

**-- "I doubt Zack would've known. I'll ask him, though."**

After that, I drove back the rest of the way to the campus and headed back to my dorm, where I crashed out of sheer exhaustion. Despite this, though, I didn't sleep well. I couldn't get the image out of my head of seeing Wydell splayed out across Ronnie's bed like that, all hacked up with pentagrams all over him. I woke up at around 8:00 that morning, though, to a flood of texts from Ronnie.

**-- "DUDE! LOOK AT THIS SHIT!"**

Following this was a google link to a news article on YouTube, as well as about 5 or 6 different screenshots. Each one was of the hospital. One or two of them looked like the inside of some of the rooms all torn apart, stuff having been thrown all over the place like a tornado had swept through, while others were of actual *people* having been torn apart. Some of them didn't even have much left of them anymore, looking like hunks of bloody meat and bones scattered across the floor. 

\-- "Dude, when was this taken?"

**-- "This morning, dude. Have U seen the footage yet?"**

I responded that I hadn't and clicked the video. Footage of the hospital from the photos appeared with the headline reading "Brutal violence in hospital at late hours of the night!” It went on to show similar pictures inside the hospital, along with people, patients and nurses alike, being wheeled out of the place. Seeing the place from the outside, I realized it was the hospital Wydell was in. This put me on edge, causing me to spend the entire video tensely waiting for it to be revealed that Wydell had been mutilated again along with the others. 

A woman then came on screen. "Only hours ago this morning, Authorities responded to a distressed call from a member of the St. Leonard's Memorial hospital staff. According to the anonymous caller, Screams and sounds of a struggle were heard from the east wing of the facility." 

The screen transitioned then to a walk inside the hospital. I saw large scratches running across the lengths of both the floor and the walls. "Authorities claim to have arrived to what they describe to be a madhouse, with hordes of people clamoring out of the hospital for their lives. Police officer, Gordon LaVey, is quoted in saying that the situation was nothing short of utter chaos."

It then cut to the Officer. "It was wild." he said. "We pull up and we couldn't even get into the parking lot because people were scattered all over the place. It took us almost twenty minutes to be able to calm enough people down to even get into the parking lot." It cut back to the reporter.

"When asked what happened inside, this was what officer LaVey had to say." It cut back to officer LaVey.

"When we could finally get someone to calm down long enough to even talk to us, the most consistent detail we could even make out was something about a "Monster" rampaging through the place. We sent a unit in, and things just went down from there." The footage then cut back to the hospital with a recording that played of the radio communications.

For about the first minute or so, it was typical back and forth chatter between the inside and outside units. Suddenly, though, I could hear the inside unit starting to panic as growling noises picked up in the distance. From there, it devolved into chaos, with the inside crew shouting frantically for backup and firing their guns in a frenzy and ground crew trying to discern what was going on. The chaos escalated when just about all I could hear from the inside unit's side was screams of pain and the growling turning into straight up roaring. 

Hearing this made my blood freeze solid. My body was stiff. I couldn't even move my eyelids to blink. I just stared slack jawed at my phone screen as the reporter went on to say that no suspects -- human or otherwise -- were detained and that investigation into the situation was ongoing. Of course, this brought me no comfort. 

All I could do was wonder what the hell that growling in the background was coming from. What the hell had all the cops thrown into a panic like that, and what caused the destruction of the hospital like what was shown? This, and what the hell happened to my friend in there? Was *he* okay?

Immediately after the news clip ended, I texted Ronnie back telling him I'd watched the news clip. 

**-- "Dude, what** ***was*** **that? You heard the shit in the background, right? Shit was freaky!"**

\-- "Yeah, I heard it. Sounded like a dog or something. A big ass dog."

**-- "A** ***dog??*** **What dog would be big enough to do all that; destroying the place like that?"**

\-- "I don't know, man, shit, that's just what it sounded like to me. I mean, it's obvious whatever the fucking thing was, *wasn't* a person."

**-- "True. Still, though, I don't know how it could've even got in. I mean, how could it have just busted in like that? Aren't there usually** ***some*** **kind of security staked out at the place?"**

\-- "The hell you asking *me* for? *YOU* knew about this before *I* did."

**-- "Yeah, but you were there last night, weren't you?"**

I stopped. He was right again. I *was* there, only hours before this all took place. Everything was fine, both when I arrived and when I left... But then, where did this thing come from and how did I or nobody else see it? 

\-- "Yeah... I was..."

**-- "And you didn't see any quote-unquote "Big-ass dogs" there, did you?"**

\-- "No. You're right, I didn't see anything like that."

**-- "What about our boy, Wy? You think he's okay?"**

My heart went into a frenzy. 

\-- "I don't know, dude. He was out cold when I left the hospital. Docs say he pulled through by a miracle when I got there. They wouldn't let me see him, though. I was gonna try and talk to him today."

**-- "Fat chance of that..."**

\-- "Yeah, well... Hey, you talk to Zack yet, ask him if he knew the girls from the party last night and how they showed up?"

**-- "Yeah. He swears up and down that he's never seen 'em before in his life before the party.And I believe him like I believe you."**

\-- "Yeah... But then... How could they have known, then?"

**-- "Dude... You don't think maybe..."**

\-- "What?"

**-- "That maybe Wydell might've invited them, do you?"**

\-- "You serious? Wydell? I'd sooner believe it was you that did it before him. Besides, why would he invite chicks over just to mutilate him like that?"

**-- "Well, I mean, if he did know them, I doubt it was because he wanted to get freaky with 'em like that. Hell, you saw the pentagrams, right; occult shit, you know?"**

\-- "Yeah, I've been thinking about that. You think that's why they were at the party? To perform some sort of human sacrifice?"

**-- "Possible."**

\-- "Why Wydell, though?"

**-- "I don't know, man. Hell, all I know is,** ***I*** **didn't invite them, you didn't invite them, and Zack didn't, either. That would have to leave him."**

\-- "And now there's whatever the hell this thing on the news was."

**-- "I know, man, shit's got me all screwed up in all kinds of different ways. Look, man, I gotta go now. Gotta get ready for class (it's Professor Rathburn's class today, too... Fuck me)."**

\-- "Okay, let me know if something else fucked up happens without me noticing, okay?"

**-- "Got it. Also, see if you can talk to Wydell, see how he's holding up and if he knows anything."**

\-- "I'll try, dude, although I don't know how I'd be able to do that."

**-- "Why not?"** 

\-- "Well, weren't the patients moved last night when they were evacuating?"

**-- "Yeah. So check Ellis General, if they moved them anywhere, it'd likely be there, right, since it's only about two or three blocks out from St. Leonard's."**

\-- "Okay, I'll try there then after my 2:30 class."

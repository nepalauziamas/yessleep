Looking back, there was so much there, so many minor signs pointing to the truth, that a part of me wonders how I missed it all this time. I suppose no one ever really expects that they might be living in a nightmare, especially when the details are so subtle. 


Now, I struggle to find comfort anywhere. Paranoia running wild amidst my mind in any home I find myself in.


Let the story of my waking nightmare be a cautionary tale. If the wrong packages are continuously arriving at your house, you need to GET OUT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. You and your loved one's lives may be in grave danger. 


I’ll do my best to tell the full story, or as much as I’ve caught on to anyways, in as many parts as it takes.


It makes my skin crawl to imagine that any of you reading this may, unknowingly, be in the exact same situation my family found ourselves in. 


And that for some of you, this message may not be warning enough until it’s too late.


…


I was in the midst of cooking dinner when the most recent package arrived. 


It was a little after half-past five when Jessie, my ancient German Malinois, began barking at the door excitedly. Gray fur rose on her tan back as she hunched over in a stiff warning stance. I watched from the kitchen with mild interest, as a stiff knock echoed from the door, and from the sidelight windows framing the door I watched as a man speed-walked away. 


Setting the mixing spoon in my hand on the counter and pushing the pot of boiling noodles to the back of the stove, I made my way to the door; urging Jessie to be quiet with a shush and patting her head. 


Peering out the sidelight window, I was just in time to catch the brown delivery truck disappearing around the corner of my block.


Upon the welcome mat on my porch sat a medium-sized package from Amazon. I wracked my brain for what purchase I might have made recently, ultimately drawing a blank. It wasn't until I read the label that an irritating realization began to dawn on me. 


'Bily Mertins'


43257 - not gonna add the rest of my address here for obvious reasons - Cold Lake, Illinois. 


It was my address. 


My name?…Not by a long shot. 


I exhaled through my nose, irritation blossoming like flowers in the spring. My mind replaying the frustrating calls I'd already had with UPS, FedEx, and the like, and the prospect of yet another less than ideal.


Still, I was shit out of ideas and running out of space. A part of me felt wrong simply trashing the stuff. 


Clearly, someone was spending actual money to have it delivered, even if to the wrong location, and in the off-chance, I ever managed to find out who it was meant for, I didn’t want to have to explain that I’d thrown away thousands of dollars worth of deliveries.


It started slowly at first, a slow trickle that seemed to follow in the weeks after we'd moved into my late Grandmother's house following her passing due to suffering a heart attack atop the stairs. 


The unexpected packages, and the odd letter, continued arriving at our door without explanation. Calls to USPS, or FedEX and the like all proving useless. 


When we lost my husband to a sudden illness, only months after moving in the frequency seemed to increase. 


The contents were never anything I’d ordered, though at the beginning they were at least useful usually. 


Snacks, food, soap, and men’s clothing, all stuff I admittedly took more often than not, unable to keep stacking box after unopened box;  but as the year stretched on the contents grew stranger and stranger, leading up to the latest.


Though they never had my name or the name of anyone who lived anywhere near me for that matter - as I found out one day after getting curious enough to actually go door to door asking neighbors if they were missing any deliveries - they always had my address.


It was easy to dismiss, at first, with any myriad of excuses; a printing error of some sort, an issue with the system at one delivery place or another, but as it continued to happen with the numbers steadily increasing from the odd arrival every other week, to an almost daily thing, I was forced to look into all of the possibilities, none of them proving useful. 


I lifted the box, using my foot to nudge Jessie back into the house as she tried to push past me.


The contents within rustled with the motion. The sound of plastic and metal against metal jangling as I lifted it and  I hobbled the box into the corner in my living room. Which was quickly becoming overrun by packages both unopened and opened under various names, all addressed to my house. 


Between my recent move and the steady stream of packages I wasn't ordering ending up at my house, the garage was a sea of boxes, the prospect of fully unpacking the space growing less feasible by the day. 


I set the box on top of another causing a rustle of metal from inside. Taking a moment to stretch my back and catch my breath, before I made my way to the kitchen, grabbing a pair of scissors. 


As I slid the blade through the tape, I opened the box to reveal layers of that inflatable protective wrap, which I piled on the table as I dug through. 


A glint of light from something caught my eye from beneath the plastic wrap, and I reached for it, my hand meeting cold metal. 


Confusion and slight disgust were my immediate reactions as I held out a pair of handcuffs covered in a cheap pink fur, the sort seemingly meant for a certain type of leisure activity. 


They were unwrapped, no plastic packaging or box included besides the protective wrap, and with stomach-turning consideration that perhaps they may be used. I tossed them aside letting them slide across the table. Jessie bounded over sniffing them eagerly. 


“No, yucky, leave them be!” I snapped, nudging her away from the restraints. 


The rest of the bag's contents were along the same lines, everything looking like it had come straight from some adult store. 


It included one of those leather ball gag things, a paddle lined with small metal studs, and another metal restraint, this one less frilly than before, that seemed meant to close around a person's ankles. 


As I looked through the box, I felt a chill travel through me and found myself peering over my shoulder instinctively for reasons I couldn’t fathom.


It was all very weird, to say the least, and clearly, nothing my chronically single self would be purchasing, even if I had use for it. 


Besides that, it made me feel uncomfortable in a way I couldn’t quite peg. Everything about it was strange, suggestive; and for the first time in a while, it made me wonder about who was on the other side of all of this. 


I lifted the box with a grunt, making my way to the garage door; maneuvering it open with an elbow and doing the same with the light switch. 


I added the box to the growing pile almost occupying the entire right half of the garage now, an exasperated sigh escaping my lips as I took momentary stock of it all.


Someone had to be paying for all of this. There had to be hundreds of dollars worth of random merchandise sitting in my living room, none of which I had ordered. Surely someone somewhere had to be missing it. 


I’d received a pair of surgical gloves and masks the week prior, which I knew weren’t coming cheap since the pandemic, a set of cookware the week before that, complete with a nice new skillet, cast iron pan, and a knife set; as well as various other household essentials from soap to trash bags. 


If UPS, FedEx, and the other services I’d called were to be believed, NO ONE had called to report a myriad of missing orders, or about any of the packages, I was certain I’d gotten by mistake despite the fact that my address was on every order.


The faint smell of burning reminded me about dinner. The distant sound of Jessie’s bark which with old age had become more of a shrieking croak - from somewhere upstairs, snapped me from my spaciness as I entered the shoe room, closing the door behind me.


It was starting to get out of hand, and I was getting tired of dealing with the near-constant stream of deliveries; especially if things like what had arrived tonight would become the norm.


What if Claire had opened tonight’s package first? I shuddered at the thought.


The last thing I needed in my life with everything that had happened in the past year would be having to navigate that talk with a twelve-year-old, especially one who already had as much going on, mentally and emotionally, as Claire who was still far from fully healed after losing her father; as I was my husband.


Aaron, my husband, had been the love of my life and an absolute gem of a father to Claire. I’ve been through enough grief counseling and group trauma circles to know that everyone feels basically the same about their dead loved ones; they were a joy to be around, everyone loved them, yadda yadda, but when I say it was true for Aaron it really was. 


From the day we’d met during our sophomore year of college, he’d known how to put a smile on my face or garner a laugh from me in my worst of moods. 


When our daughter was born it was clear he had that same charm with her. From birth, Claire had been a daddy's girl, known to throw a tantrum when I even dared take her from his arms, and all the way up until his death that hadn’t changed. 


Aaron got sick about a year ago, suddenly and violently. 


The progression was…quick. One day he was complaining about a bit of fatigue and running out of breath, certain it was some form of COVID, and by the next month, he was bedridden and in and out of a coma - vomiting blood and whatever else his stomach contained most of his waking hours.


 His death shook my world in ways I couldn’t begin to fathom. It was like someone had stolen the sun, and expected me to wake up and live tomorrow as though nothing was wrong, and it hit even harder for Claire. We’d spent the last year doing our best to heal and find a new normal despite the massive gaping hole in our lives that never felt more present than at the dinner table.


Jessie’s incessant yipping continued without an end in sight.


“Jessie, hush up girl! Claire, go see what she’s barking at please?” I called from the living room, turning my head to better cast my voice out of the room and up the stairs. 


I had a sneaking suspicion I already knew.


There was a moment of silence before I heard the groan of floorboards overhead indicating movement, traveling towards the hallway upstairs. Jessie’s barking continued, almost incessantly, a shrill, wheezy sort of yip now. 


The poor dog was ancient, mostly blind at this point and working her way towards being deaf, with a myriad of quirks, the latest of which has been her habit of barking non-stop while staring blindly at the ceiling of our house ever since Aaron had passed. He’d been her person, and without him, she seemed just as lost as the rest of us.


“She’s fine, Mom,” Claire’s voice called back from upstairs.


“She’s just barking at the ceiling again!” 


Of course. I rolled my eyes and returned to the kitchen, wrapping up the spaghetti I’d started, and called Claire down for dinner as silence finally fell from upstairs, as thoughts of our most recent delivery faded from my mind.


Before I delve into the events that have unfolded in our home in recent weeks and exposed me to the nature of the nightmare I was living in unconsciously, it’s integral that I share with you the conversation my daughter and I had that night at dinner. 


Thinking back on it now, so much of what I would discover was obvious then.


We ate in relative silence that night, as had become something of a habit. My questions about school were answered with the briefest answers possible as Claire ran her fork through her food idly. 


We talked for a bit about the growing mound of boxes in the living room, which I told her I’d find a solution for soon when the conversation petered out. 


She seemed to stare past me, eyes zoning out at some point on the ceiling, clearly distracted.


“Is everything okay? You alright?” I asked.


She blinked once, then twice as her mind returned, and sighed looking at me for a moment with a look of consideration.


“You can tell me anything baby, you know that.” 


She sighed again, twisting a rising pile of noodles with her fork. I could practically see the question in her expression, the need to ask whatever it was swelling bigger and bigger the longer she tried to hold it in.


When she looked at me, it was with a seriousness in her young eyes I hadn’t seen since her father’s funeral.


“Mommy, do you ever talk to daddy still?”


The question caught me completely off guard and I tried to suck in a breath. Inhaling with it a loose piece of the spaghetti, prompting a coughing fit which only grew worse the harder I tried to control it.


It’s not like we haven’t discussed Aaron’s passing, on the contrary. I’d made a point of trying to unpack her emotions with her several times in the last few months following the advice of countless therapists, but I always met the same sort of resistance with her. Reaching a point at which she refused to keep talking about him. 


I didn’t hold it against her. 


I was, and I am, hurting more than is possible to express, and I couldn’t imagine how a child copes with such pain, but suffice it to say hearing her bring him up, and to ask such a…strange question, hit with the force of an airbag.


I gathered myself as hastily as I could, seeing those big brown, questioning eyes of my daughter - so much like her fathers - searching for a way to answer. 


We’d never really been the religious sort, and especially hadn’t raised Claire that way at all so for a moment I wasn’t even quite sure what she meant by the question. 


“Well,” I started, feeling so much like those cheesy sitcom parents when their kids ask about puberty or something, reaching blindly for a response I didn’t have prepared; like a man in the dark.


“I - think about daddy a lot. I talk about him out loud by myself sometimes, and I guess, yeah, I guess sometimes I try to talk to him.”


Fuck. I felt the beginnings of a lump forming in my throat. Which I was more than accustomed to at this point, a side effect of any attempt to discuss Aaron. Still, I had to hold it together in front of Claire, if nobody else, she deserved and needed my strength.


She looked me over, her expression unreadable, before turning her gaze back to her twirling fork amidst the pasta.


“Does Daddy ever talk to you?”


The pang in my chest felt like a small dagger.


Hold it together. I had to repeat it to myself mentally, a veritable mantra in that moment which I clung to to stave off tears. 


Such an innocent question, but God, if it didn’t hit like a ton of bricks. 


I wish he did baby. 


It was the response I wanted to give, but it didn’t feel constructive.


“No, but…I think he’s listening.” I finally managed my tone a bit shaky and somber despite myself.


“That would be nice though, huh?” I added with a forced laugh, doing my best to inject levity into the atmosphere.


Claire didn’t laugh or even crack a smile. 


Instead, she looked away, glancing down at the floor with an expression usually reserved for when she had done something wrong; or was hiding something…


My smile wavered a bit, fading mostly, though I didn’t want to give her the impression I was upset.


“I do”, she said, so quietly it was almost a whisper.


“You do what, sweetheart?”


She glanced up at me with a nervous sort of look, face still cast downward.


“I talk to daddy.” she finally said, as though admitting to something she knew was wrong.


I opened my mouth, then found I wasn’t quite sure what to say and closed it again. My mind searched frantically for what to say, but found only silence.


No amount of grief counseling, classes on parenting through loss, or therapist advice had prepared me for what to say when my daughter claims to speak to my dead husband. 


She watched me intently, even stopping spinning her fork to gauge my reaction.


“Oh, really?” was all I could think to respond at that moment.


I wanted to slap myself for my lack of eloquence as I watched her little face fall.


“He knew you wouldn’t believe me”, she muttered, sounding defeated. 


“That’s why I wasn’t supposed to tell you. Cause you wouldn’t believe that he came back for us, so I was supposed to keep it a secret.”


Confusion and an equal amount of concern blossomed in the wake of that statement, my mind torn on which to express first. 


I chewed thoughtfully on a mouthful of pasta, rolling the noodles around with my tongue; as something of a nervous tick. While I tried to think of just how to respond to my daughter telling me she was speaking with her dead father, and that he had told her to keep it a secret.


I’d heard from a friend of mine studying child psychology that said children can cope with loss in strange ways to protect themselves. Manufacturing imaginary friends or playing pretend can be a part of that, as jarring as such habits can appear all of the sudden. Was this just that? Was Claire imagining conversations with her father? 


Could that really be healthy?


“Who said I don’t believe you, huh?” I asked, keeping my tone light and playful.


She shot me a look halfway between ‘who are you kidding?’ and ‘do you mean it?’, before glancing back down at her lap, as she murmured her response.


“Daddy. He told me it had to be our secret, that if you found out I was talking to him, you would make him go away again.”


I couldn’t quite pinpoint why, but her words raised the hairs along my back, and piqued a sort of primal unease in me. There was just something about what she was saying that rang with an almost predatory air. 


“Well”, I began, scouring my thoughts for a response that wouldn’t crush whatever coping mechanism she had found, while also expressing that what her imaginary ‘dad’ was telling her wasn’t right. 


There was nothing explicitly dangerous in what she’d said, but it raised alarm bells I couldn’t shake.


“First off, there’s nothing you can’t tell me, understand? You’re my favorite little lady, and it’s my job to look after you; but to do that, I have to know what’s going on in your life, okay?” 


She nodded, her short brown curls bouncing on her shoulders as she did, the timid look never waning.


“So, you’ve been talking to your father? Do you…do that often?”


I felt insane even asking the question, my heart pounding for reasons I couldn’t quite peg as I tried to read the look on my daughter's face. 


She nodded slowly, shoving a mouthful of twisted spaghetti into her mouth, chewing for a moment before she spoke.


“Sometimes. Only when it’s really dark out, really late at night I hear him talking to me. He sounds different but I know it’s him because he knows so much about me, and you.” 


She sounded both excited, and nervous to speak about it, as though this was something she’d been holding in for a while.


She looked up at me, eyes shining with a look of sincere worry as if I were the one telling her about having conversations with my dead husband. 


“He misses you, mom. Talks about you a lot, about being with you, laying in your bed together. He says that you’re as beautiful as when he first laid eyes on you.” she said. She returned to poking at the remaining food on her plate as I reeled from her response, my mind grasping for anything to say.


“That’s -” I found myself at a loss, searching and failing to find the words to craft a response to what I’d just heard. 


My head pounded, torn between a growing concern for my daughter’s mental state, and the growing pool of despair forming;, as though her words had burst some pipe in which I’d managed to keep the emotion bundled, springing a leak.


“I - I miss him too.”


Claire nodded, but she watched me, eyes inquisitive and a bit worried as she tried to read my reaction. She glanced down at her plate again, stirring a bit in her seat, brows knit as a frown overtook her features.


“I’m not crazy, Momma. I promise I’m not.”


I felt my face go flush, worrying immediately about what expression I must have worn to make her feel the need to say that.


“Of course, you aren’t, baby. I’d never think such a thing, why would you say that?”


She shrugged, and her response made my heart fall and the beginnings of a cold pit of unease start to form.


“He told me that’s what anyone would think if I told them about him.”


…


We watched a movie together that night in an attempt to bring the mood up, as I could tell our dinner conversation had left us both feeling somewhat somber. After doing a quick Google search for animated films without a dead parent or parents as a major plot point, we settled on Mulan.


At some point halfway through the movie, Claire fell asleep, her head slowly settling into my lap as she did. Despite my wanting to get up and get us both to bed, I could feel my eyelids growing heavier, the sensation of sandpaper more pronounced with every blink as I slowly began to slip into the fog of sleep.


My eyes fluttered between closed and open almost unconsciously, my mind drifting lazily in that twilight between the sleeping and waking worlds, floating ever closer to the former.


The distant sound of strained barking, all too familiar at this point, almost worked itself into my sleep as it began again from upstairs. The damn dog was barking at the ceiling…Again.


I was far too tired to get up and quiet Jessie, opting to let her drone on until she’d tired herself out, and had almost managed to sleep in spite of it when -


THUD. 


A massive noise shook the walls for a moment, followed by a loud and familiar yelp.


The shock that traveled through me hit like a bolt of lightning, jolting me awake, if not a little dazed as my eyes darted wildly around the room, head on a swivel. 


For several seconds I struggled to regain my senses, not sure who or what I’d just heard as my mind returned from the borders of sleep. It sounded like the slam of a door, or something heavy being dropped coming from somewhere on the 2nd floor of the house, followed by a quieter but still rather heavy sound.


I squinted, unsure at first if the steady shake of the wall was an effect of the sleep-blurred vision, or reality. Settling on the latter as a thin shower of dust rained from the ceiling above, a clear sign that something had made an impact somewhere.


Did Jessie knock something over perhaps?


Unsure of what to do for a few moments, I waited to see if there would be any repeat of the slam, or if there was anything else to hear amongst the silence, my ear perking involuntarily as my heart raced from the residual shock. 


I rose slightly from the couch, carefully sliding from beneath Claire and replacing my lap with a pillow as she stirred slightly, her sleeping face frowning as I stepped away moving gingerly. As I rose, I rounded the couch, making my way into the foyer and stopping at the bottom of the stairs. 


The hallways upstairs were pitch-black now that the sun had set fully, no lights yet turned on. I listened, trying my best to hear over the beating of my heart, which was oddly quick, pumping strange anxiety through my veins though I had no notion why.


“Jessie?” I called up the stairs, waiting to hear the jingle of her collar as she made her way over at the sound of her name. 


Nothing.


I stared into the pool of darkness that reached past the landing of the stairs, swallowing mine and Claire’s rooms whole in its inky blackness and a chill ran down my spine like a gentle caress from the fingers of a dead man. 


There was something…odd, something more than the general foreboding when confronting the dark, something I couldn’t shake as I stared up into the hallway. A sense that perhaps[ something might be staring back.

l protest under my foot; I felt a cold, growing sense of dl Jessie.


It almost looked like she was sleeping at first, her little body stirring faintly until I looked closer and saw the pool of blood and foam pouring from her nose and slack jaw, and noticed the stirring come strange and sporadically. 


She was convulsing. 


“Jessie, oh dear God no, what’s wrong girl!” I hardly recognized my own voice through the panic that was surging in me like water against a levee in a hurricane. 


My heart pounded against the wall of my chest. Panic and adrenaline-induced nausea twisting my gut into sickening knots as I rushed over to my dog's side, vision growing steadily blurrier. I knew I loved the animal, but until that moment, I guess I wasn’t aware of just how much the prospect of losing her fucking gutted me. 


I’d bought her for Aaron years ago when Claire was still walking around in diapers, and the two had been best friends from the day she arrived as a puppy. Having her, was like still having the smallest part of him, and watching her foaming and convulsing on the floor in a starkly similar condition to how I’d found Aaron when he first began battling his ailment was almost too much.


“C’mon baby, wake up, you’re okay girl,” I chided through tears, pushing her to move or respond somehow.


 The only sound she made was a long whistling hiss of a breath, that sounded as though it had wracked her lungs to even manage. 


“Mom, is everything -” I spun at the sound of Claire’s voice, facing her in the doorway. She rubbed lazily at her eyes, sleep heavily present in her features until her eyes met Jessie.


Her eyes widened, and gleamed with a layer of fresh tears, hands rushing up to her mouth which just hung agape. 


“I don’t know what’s wrong with her,” I started, panic present in my voice despite myself, “Was there anything in here she could have eaten?”


Claire only shook her head, her eyes never leaving Jessie’s body lightly convulsing on her rug.


“I need to take her to an emergency vet, Jesus Christ let one be open.” I kneeled over, muttering a prayer that whatever had happened to Jessie hadn’t broken anything, and hoisted her up, cradling the animal in my arms as I made my way out the room.


Claire remained frozen as I pushed past her, seemingly entranced by the small pool of blood and foam that had come from Jessie, now dissolving into a stain on her carpet. 


“He told me…” she breathed, her voice shaking, as she looked at me for the first time, tears running freely now. 


“Claire, what? What’s wrong? I have to go now!” I snapped more than I’d meant to, feeling immediately guilty as I saw her blink in surprise, ushering forth even more tears.


“He told me not to tell you, or he’d have to punish me…he told me…he told me…” she continued to repeat that to herself, slowly lowering herself into a fetal position, hugging her legs close. 


She remained there like that, just staring at the stain on her carpet.


I wanted more than anything to comfort her, to bend down and hold her, but with the growing strain of holding the fifty-plus pound dog, and Jessie’s worsening condition, I had no time.


“Listen, I’ve got to go now. I’ll…make sure Jessie is okay,” I lied, “But you have school tomorrow and it’s already late, so just…try and get some sleep.”


She glanced over her shoulder back at me, and the look of sheer guilt and sadness twisting her features almost broke me.


“This is my fault.” She said.


“No, it’s not, please, just get some rest baby. I have to go.”


With that, I left, lumbering the fifty-plus pound animal down the stairs and out the door. I swayed under her weight as I freed an arm to open the rear door, pushing her onto the seat as gently as I could before I threw open the driver side door, phone in hand by the time I climbed in. 


I quickly found the nearest open emergency vet clinic a little over fifteen minutes away. 


I pulled out of the driveway not even bothering to check the rearview, the air around me buzzing with the same nervous energy the night seemed rife with now.


As I took one last passing glance at the house, I caught Claire watching from the window of her bedroom, her figure outlined against the light inside. 


From the periphery of my vision, I caught sight of something. Movement, brief, so quick it was impossible to know I’d seen anything for sure, but in the back of my mind, I could have sworn I’d seen someone draw the curtain shut.


My heart lurched, as my eye was drawn to the uppermost window of the house, just in time to catch the lace white curtain as it closed. I felt a trickle of fear for a moment before I found some rationalization.


There’s a Goddamn draft in the attic. I told myself, as I started off towards the clinic. 


The ghost of your dead husband is not haunting your home, Allie. It’s just a draft.


Whether I believed that or not, I couldn’t have begun to imagine the reality of the situation. 


If I had, I’d have gotten us both far away from that house the moment Claire found that letter...

I know it has been a very long time since I posted. So I thought I'd reintroduce myself to new people reading my story. My name is Hugh and I moved into a house in the woods and when I arrived I was greeted by creatures of unknown horror. Not all of these creatures were out to get me like my best friend Charles the seedling, or the skinwalker that had vanished during my last post.

I now work for a company called "redacted" and I'm here to finish my story. There are a lot of things I know now that I didn't know at the time...

The last time I left off I went to bed after being followed by people in a van. That night was incredibly rough. I could hear the sound of the Gossipers using the voice of my deceased grandfather telling me to open the doors to let them in. That was the night I learned that Gossipers did not work alone. They had managed to find some other entity to join them in tormenting me. I named them "solicitors", I imagine everyone has had solicitors knock on their door preaching the word of god or asking you to buy some sort of merchandise. These creatures are different they can bother you by getting near you. I went to my door to figure out who was knocking on my door when I was met with a completely dark figure wearing a black hat on the other side.

I didn't open the door due to the large stature of the creature and its speech pattern. It kept asking through the door. "Sir, I would like to talk to you. I need some help I've been trapped out here for quite some time." This might be able to fool most people that don't live in a situation like mine. Through text, it seems like a perfectly understandable sentence. When spoken it was like the person on the other side was struggling to even pronounce the words "would, like, and talk". That wasn't even the only thing Its voice was just unnaturally deep as if it was spoken through some sort of voice changer.

Since it was unable to get inside unless I allowed it in I decided to talk to it. This is how that conversation went.

"Hey buddy, you don't sound alright I imagine you would like in"

It kept responding to me with "Yes please, I am hurt pretty badly"

In which I told it.

"I imagine did you trip in fall with those early long legs of yours?"

Keep in mind with this all going on the Gossipers were too stupid to stop their talking making this entity's story completely unbelievable, and after I told it that it proceeded to knock at a faster pace and a lot louder and this was not one of the nights where I would allow my self to be so easily fucked with.  I asked the Solicitor to give me one second and ill be right back with something for him.

I entered my bedroom and whipped out a machete I had bought before I moved here, and walked back to the creature. I told him "Come a little closer to the door I'm having a little trouble hearing you." and when he did I slid the machete underneath the door hitting it in its feet. It began to scream in an incomprehensible voice.

I watched as it proceeded to walk backward into the woods to where the Gossipers were and everything had finally gone silent in the area.

Charles proceeded to walk out of my bedroom since he slept inside due to the mass of Gossipers that had been in the area. He asked me on a little notepad " Are we safe inside?". I didn't believe so but I lied to Charles to keep him from being scared. We eventually went back to bed and I slept with the machete under my pillow, out of fear of the creature deciding it can somehow get in the house.

The next morning I had decided to go back outside and check on the doorway. It had started to grow to about the height of the creature last night. which was probably around 7 feet. Me and Charles decided that we needed to find a way to keep these creatures from getting through the doorway or at least prolonged them from getting to my house or the townspeople. Charles had grown large hedges with thorns around the doorway, and I had sharpened large sticks and stuck them inside of it in hopes that if something had decided to crawl through It would be impaled.

Once we finished doing that, we decided to head back into town again to gather some supplies, the ride was stressful. We had just got followed by a black van and I was nervous it would find us again. Luckily nothing had happened. I did notice something I hadn't realized before. People were sick around the town.

From what I heard on the local radio is that people should stay in their homes and try not to get near people. The symptoms were "Redness to the skin, Blistering, and violent hallucinations". I entered the local gun store and purchased myself a pump action shotgun. This was so I could rack it and scare the shit out of anything that came near me or my house. I had left quickly though after noticing the cashier had slight blisters forming on the skin of his neck.

The drive home was normal and peaceful, I was finally able to relax and listen to some music. I zoned out until I noticed a pair of headlights in front of my house.

It was the black van again, and two people were knocking on my door. I racked my shotgun and hopped out of my car. I point it at the two people and told them " What are you doing at my house, and why did you follow me last night you have no idea how dangerous these woods are, and I'm not even referring to myself"

Both of the gentlemen turned around and raised their hands. One of the younger men yelled back at me " You better lower that gun before you have the company on your ass". The Older gentleman looked back at his friend and told him. "Silence, we are on this man's property and we definitely gave him a scare last night. He has every right to point that gun at us."

I told the older gentleman " What do you mean by The Company, and who are both of you."

The older man chuckled and told me " Lower your gun I promise I have answers for you. We are not here to hurt you, on quite the contrary to be exact. We were sent out here due to the large number of recent missing persons reported in this city. We believe this might be due to some entities, like you said there are more dangerous things out here in the forest. So why don't we go inside and have a chat."

I told them " For me to let you bastards in you will need to empty your pockets, and drop any weapons you have on you."

They complied and I took anything they had on them and led them inside, I didn't lower my gun until we made it into my living room. They sat on my couch while I kept my shotgun steadied on them in my lap

I asked them "So what are you guys doing here and what is the company?"

The older man spoke up and said " As you know there are creatures that inhabit these woods. Who do you think keeps the make-believe fictitious? "

I told him " I don't know, what are you the men in black?"

He gave out a chuckle and said " No son, the men in black wish they were us. We hunt down the things that are believed to reside in nightmares. Not just creatures from outer space. Why don't you let that little fella Charles out of your pocket now?"

This caught me off guard, they must have been watching me for a while if they knew about Charles.

I sat Charles down on the floor and he grew to his normal height.

The old man told me " He's such an amazing specimen. They don't usually befriend people due to their sheltered nature. Do not worry we do not hunt creatures like these. They are classified as ranked 1 entities and are actually from our reality."

I knew this already but him telling me they do not go after ranked 1 creatures made me relax more and I lowered my gun and sat it up on the nightstand next to me. What had me concerned though was what he meant by "Our Reality". I asked him " What do you mean by our reality, are you saying there are more?

"Precisely son, and what we believed is that there is some kind of mist, fog, or a doorway that resides on this property. From your posts though, we discovered that you stated there was some kind of doorway here. That's why I also knew you had the little fella on you."

I knew that posting about this place might have been dangerous. I didn't realize the kind of attention I would get.  I told them a bit angrily " So you guys know about everything. So then you should know about the old god living inside of that damn door"

He spoke up and in a more stern voice "Boy like I said we deal with the things you couldn't even imagine. Every reality has creatures living in them and are all different. The portal you have here is most likely a dead realm, these have opened up before but had been luckily closed before anything serious could come through. I don't think you understand but this sickness in your town is caused by an entity that has been leaving that realm. It is truly amazing that you are immune to it, I guarantee this is thanks to Charles. People from the company have to be vaccinated to fight off these viruses and that doesn't always work, and the samples we have been taking from the local area and wildlife have already shown that is spreading at an alarming rate."

I told him what does the company want from me, if you guys know how to close this thing why couldn't you just do it and leave me out of it?

The younger gentleman laughed "Why do you think, With a corporation as secret as ours don't you think we would have silenced you and finished the job yesterday? We are here to invite you to the company. Someone that's able to make friends with these entities is needed in our line of work. Also from the looks of you, I'm starting to think the poison is finally setting in."

My eyes began to widen as I looked down and noticed down my arms my skin started to turn black and blue, and I couldn't move anymore.

The older man spoke up and said " Son I'm giving you one option, and an invitation to the company is incredibly rare. If you come to work with us you will be forced to hunt down these creatures but will be rewarded. If you don't in around 3 minutes your heart with completely stop."

There was nothing I could do. I knew that I couldn't leave Charles alone, so many what-ifs came to mind. I settled on my answer.

"Fine, I'll join you."

The younger man got up and stabbed my leg with a needle and told me before I blacked out. "Welcome to the company"

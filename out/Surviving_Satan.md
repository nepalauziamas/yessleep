Hello to all who are taking the time to read my post. This is not a story, this is not a fairytale, and this is most certainly not a creepypasta posted on r/nosleep for entertainment.This is my real life experience and I want the world to know the truth of this dark and sinister world we live in....

**note to reader** this is my first time typing out something of this magnitude so please bare with me...I'm not the talented Stephen King, although I may have diareeah of the mouth like him, but I need to give you a proper background before it gets "good" and "riveting" so you understand how this all came to be. There will be no fabrications nor will I be stretching the truth in this post whatsoever.

**Here is my story:**

My name is Jimmy. I'm 34 years old and I'm trying to overcome this traumatic experience and find my way in life. I'm sure some will rag on me for not having my shit together right now and I'm sure some will perhaps relate to me not being established anymore. I've always been an extrovert. As outgoing and charismatic as they come. I was a professional barber for about 15 years, starting in high-school and honing my skills to where I confidently opened up my own barbershop business. I did quite well as I am great at communicating with people and delivering an exceptional service to them. You meet a vast array of different people as a barber. You meet regular Joe Shmoes, you meet high profile widely known people, you meet doctors, you meet felons, you meet cops, you meet lawyers, shit I even met a well known pop singer. You definitely come across EVERY walk of life imaginable as a barber...Different people from all different backgrounds. I loved it. Making people happy & hearing the many crazy and different stories from all walks of life while making enough money to give my son and I a happy life and then some. There is, however, a sad, almost surreal reason why I closed the doors doors my business and gave up my passion entirely. You might ask yourself...if he was so good at it and really enjoyed going to work every day why the hell would he stop? Well reader, I am about to tell you the darkest rabbit hole I ever was lost in...

It was about two and a half years ago. Maybe three. I received a phone call from an unknown number which didn't surprise me considering my phone number was pretty much open to everyone as many of my clients would text or call me to schedule appointments. As I earlier said, and not to toot my own horn but i was very good at cutting men and woman's hair so of course I got alot of texts and calls from random folks who heard about me via word of mouth so getting a call from an unknown number wasn't out of the norm for me as like I I said i cut ALL walks of life...but this call...for whatever reason felt different.

Caller:  "HI is this Jimmy?" 

Me: "Yes it is, who's calling?" 

Caller: "Hey Jim, this is Damion. I'm trying to schedule an appointment with you...Heard great things from my buddy (*doesn't mention name of buddy which was kind of weird*) and I'm in need of a new solid barber...Got any availability this week?"

Me: "Hi Damion, I got you 100% you're in good hands...how does say....(*flips through apt book to find an open slot for him*)
Next Tuesday, 2pm sound?"

Caller: "Would you be able to do something later? Perhaps 6pm? I work late, if that's that's inconviencince I will greatly show my gratitude."

**Not being able to turn down new clientele or money I re-check my apt book**

Me: "I'm booked until closing...I can take you after my last cut, can you be here at 7pm?"

Caller: "I'll be there. Thanks again you're a lifesaver...see you Tuesday!"

Me: "no worries bro see ya Tuesday!"

**call ends** 

It's important to point out that after that phone call a wave of uncertainty splashed upon me in the most subtle way...

I go about my life as I would any day. Wake up, wake my son up, make breakfast for us (I'm a single father and I have my son FT) do my morning routine, drop him off off school, go to the shop, service my clients until closing, and return home with my son. Tuesday comes the same as every day comes. I finish my last client and almost as if on que, a gentleman of about 40 something years old  strolls in as I'm sweeping the last of today's fallen hair. I'm a heterosexual but this guy was good-looking. *too goodlooking* he was dressed casually, but in the most sharp way imaginable. I'm assuming this is Damion, and as with everyone else who enters my shop I greet him in a laid back and friendly manner.

Me: "Ahh you must be Damion. *reaches out hand to formally introduce myself* I'm Jimmy."

Damion: "Good evening Jimmy! *shakes my hand, solid and firmly* that's me, pleasure to meet you. Thanks again for fitting me in! How are ya?"

Me: "can't complain Damion, have a seat, *gestures to my old school vintage Koken barber chair* make yourself comfortable"

*another wave of that certain uncertainty falls upon me...I shrug it off as this seems to be a stand up guy...nothing wrong here Jimmy..Calm down*

We make the usual first time client small talk; where he's from, his hobbies, occupation, likes & dislikes, nothing that could lead to making him nor I feel uncomfortable. I need to point out that regardless of our innocent conversations I still felt uncomfortable...in my own barbershop...Weird...

I come to find out he's from the city of angels...Where people go to find happiness and fame and they leave with a souvenir of pain and sorrow...California. 

He recently moved to the east coast for business. He's an executive at a major nationwide firm that handles rich peoples money. That's all the info he really gave me. For such a successful guy he was pretty dodgy about how he got to that position and barely explained what his job even consists of...I didn't find this too strange as like I've previously said, I meet ALL types of people and I've met a fair share of private folks...

What really didn't sit well with me is that during our 40 minutes together, not once did he mention family ie; children, spouse, not even the friend who told him about me...Not once did he mention what he enjoys in life nor did he vent about any stressors in his life. This is a tad bit strange, even for a first time client. I'm a good reader of people...he's no way at all shy or introverted... I could tell by the swagger he left behind each strong step he took when entering the shop.

He seemed to know alot about me though, not majorly surprising considering I have social media pages for my business and being the owner my full name is basically  public knowledge...Yeah I know you can find out alot with a person's name but he knew a little too much about my persona which really struck me sideways as I don't even tell my most loyal clients personal things about myself. The less people know about you the better, in my opinion..He didn't come out blatantly with what he knew but he subtly hinted at things in the most innocent way which made me really wonder about him...

I finish his haircut and he comes across very appreciative and satisfied with my work. Hands me a HUNDRED dollar bill, (I charge $25 for a haircut) and requests another appointment the following Tuesday at the same time..That's really not ideal seeing as my son and I would be getting home at around 8:30pm and he has school the next day, but he was persistent, in the way that I felt OBLIGATED to give him what he wanted...I didn't feel like I, nor my son would be in any type of danger had I declined, yet I felt like I really needed to submit to this guy's requests...

We get home and I cook Tommy (my son) dinner while he takes a bath. I get his pajamas out & I read him a short story while he drifts to sleep. I try to do the same but it takes me hours to fall asleep...

The next week flies by without incident...7pm on Tuesday rolls in and Damion enters my shop at 6:59pm exactly.

All goes well, yet deep down I feel that sense of uncertainty and discomfort...I shrug it off and finish my service. He pays me and requests I be put in my appointment book every Tuesday, 7pm, indefinitely. I oblige and although Damion doesn't offer any information on himself, I come to enjoy his time in my chair, not just for the weekly $100 but for some reason I can't obtain. He is *polarizing*

Fast forward 2 months. Tommy & my lives are the same as always. School, work, eat, sleep, repeat. However this Tuesday will start the end of the cozy life I knew..

 Damion arrives at 6:59pm per usual. He sits in my chair, we shoot the shit, I cut his hair, and after he pays me he asks me a peculiar question that takes me a step back...

Damion: "Jimmy, my man, when was the last time you had some fun? You're here six days a week and when you're not servicing your clients your servicing your son...Tell me brother, would you like to attend my annual Halloween bash this year? It's a costume party too it'll be *a hell of a time*"

*the reason I'm taken aback is because while many of my  clients have asked me to grab drinks, catch a Sox game, or something along those lines , I would have NEVER expected a well established and professional oriented man to throw some silly Halloween party...

**Once again I feel like no isn't an answer and I'm obligated to attend.**

Me: "shit well uhh sure man. I'd love to go...Costumes are a must though huh?"

Damion: "have some Halloween spirit my boy! Would it really be a true hallows eve party if there weren't costumes?! Hey I can promise many fine looking females will surely catch your eye with their one of a kind costumes!"
 
He looks at me in a way I've never been looked at before....I almost look away....in fear? Most likely not but I still almost couldn't maintain eye contact...

Me: "ahhh what the hell. Count me in bro. Text me the address & I'll see ya there! Thanks for the invite Dame."

Damion: "way ahead of ya brother man...I already dropped you a pin to where it's at...look forward to seeing you there!"

And just like that, before i can even register the fact that he already gave me the address before even inviting me, he swiftly walks out the door in his quick strides full of swagger. 

**October 31st, 2018**

I soon realized I can't just wear an old RedSox hat and a Damon jersey for a costume because I'm sure this event will be over the top just like Damion, and I'm not trying to be *that guy* I ended up purchasing a costume doctors coat, stethoscope, and some fake blood. Evil doctor seemed reasonable to me.

I drop Tommy off at my moms place for the night in his Spiderman attire, ready to indulge on candy and bounce off his grandmother's walls. I put the address in my phones gps and off I go...

45 minutes later the robotic voice let's me know I've arrived at my destination. I remember this 100% exactly. My jaw drops when I see this house...not even a house...a mansion...A mansion on the beach...You got to be kidding me! This guy really must have did something right in his life..that's for sure.

I'm not the shy type as i've previous informed you guys but yet again that uncertain woozy feeling rushes across me and leaves as fast as it came...

I walk up to the giant doors and use the brass knocker hoping someone would hear and come to greet me inside...what happens is the door creaks open as if done by some force that can't be seen...I shrug it off and walk inside hoping I don't drip fake blood on his fancy black & white checkerboard carpet. Weird sense of decor but hey to each their own..

A masked figure wearing an intense monster suit with claws and horns atop it's head approaches me making its way past a cluster fuck of many partygoers in costumes, most of which have their face hidden. The way this person walks up to me so confident and swift I already know it's Damion.

Damion: "Jimmy my boy! HAPPY HALLOWEEN The best barber on the east coast! Love the costume!! Welcome to my humble abode, friend!! Come here ya crazy bastard!!"

**he hands me a silly looking Bill Clinton rubber mask which I halfheartidly accepted and put on *never liked the suffocating way masks made me feel*.. He also comes in for a bro hug, I hesitate as I don't want to transfer the fake blood on my costume onto him and he's keen to noticing this**

Damion: "relax my friend I'm definitely NOT afraid of a little blood!! I'm satan for God's sake!!" *laughs at his joke referencing his costume*

**we slap each other a bro handshake and do that quick bro hug us guys tend to do to people we enjoy**

Me: "Happy Halloween Dame! You really did well for yourself huh?! *my modest and humble shack of a house comes to mind* Thanks for having me man, I appreciate it!"

Damion: "Well like they say hard work pays off. Im glad you could make it Jimmy i really am...Fancy a drink? Follow me, open bar!!!!"

**the sense of uncertainty and unease soon leave my body completely and I quickly forget that feeling ever happened to me**

I take in my surroundings...Very LOUD party music, many woman barely dressed in anything that's NOT modest are dancing, laughing, smiling. There's a few guys at a table making quite large lines of cocaine to soon be snorted. Group of people taking hits & sharing with one another a Marijuana cigarette... There's a bartender dressed in a tuxedo albeit wearing a mask shaking a margarita at a bar that takes up half of the entire room. Mind you, we had to have walked through 3 rooms already just to make it to the bar. As Damion and I approach, the sea of people without hesitation make room for us to get through. They all are looking at Damion like they're infatuated in him. Throwing compliments and kind words to their host. They LOVE him...They **idolize** him. It's hard to digest all of this... Once we get to the two open stools at the bar, the bartender literally puts the shaker down and comes to us awaiting our drink requests. Damion orders two "Souless Sangrias" which he says are from his own recipe. I go to sit in the stool while we wait for our drinks and he says

 "no no my boy, come mingle! I want you to meet the select other few V.I.P.S i've invited. They're my great friends just like you."

Almost like a movie, as soon as he finishes his sentence, the sharp dressed masked bartender brings us our drinks. They look ravishing although the color of its contents is almost a match to the fake blood on my doctor coat. 

Me: "vip?! Me? I'm just a barber Dame nothing too special haha but thanks I'd love to meet the peers of a man like you! They must be so fascinating!"

**I'd like to point out that I'm NOT an ass kisser. I don't need validation from people to secure my confidence. But this guy...he's like someone...*something* I've never met before. Through all the hundreds and thousands of folks I've met in my career and life, nobody can come close to the magnitude of importance this man generates. It's unreal.**

 *I can feel his inviting smile even through his hidden face*

Damion: "they're just regular people like you and myself, my boy. You will get along perfect. Follow me"

We make it through 3 more rooms that were FULL of people, body to body, shoulder to shoulder, we get in and out with great ease. No need to be pushy or say "scuse me, scuse me" constantly. The path was wide open for Damion.They really looked up to this guy...I thought to myself there's no way all these folks know him, that would be un herd of..Yet they all looked at him with happy and googly eyed faces like they had intense love for him like he's a god or something...

We walk up a long and lavish set of stairs to the second floor of his mansion. I feel the urge to piss like a racehorse. I mean yeah I finished half of my "souless sangria" but damn already got to break the seal? I ask Damion where the bathroom is and he smoothly says 

"Go left, take a right at the end of that hallway, follow it to the end and there will be two doors. One will read incubus' and the other will be succubus'."

Me: "suck-you-what?!?!"

Damion: *laughs at my ignorance*  "I made sure my assistant went all out for the party theme my boy...I'll explain what they are later...just use the one labeled *incubus* please hurry, the fun will soon begin my boy."

*the pressure in my bladder bypasses my questions and confusion...I nod and go to find the toilet*

I obviously get lost as well as mesmerized. The music can't be heard as well up here and as I walk past the many doors which happen to have bronze plated plaques where the peephole would be with gold encrusted script that looks to be in Latin maybe? As I continue down the corridor, strange sounds enter my eardrums...I hear things I can't describe...So weird and unusual....people who I believe to be maybe chanting in a language I can't describe, some people moaning in pure ecstasy, some people screaming in pain and crying for help.. loud metal object sounding tools being used in some way shape or form...at this time I start feeling intoxicated. Not the usual buzz you get from say a 6 pack of lager no. This is a feeling I'm not used to. I can't understand this because I've only drank one single drink that had the slightest hint of alcohol in it. My legs feel as though they gained 200 lbs. A subtle feeling of bliss and ecstasy envelops my body and soul. I forget I even have to urinate. I just keep walking. My hand gently brushes against the wall...my fingers even are starting to feel euphoric now..

What the fuck was in that sangria....

After what seems like 3 hours I make it to a door that reads "succubus" and one that reads "incubus" in my state of intoxication & confusion I chose which door to enter blindly figuring a toilets a toilet.  I walk in & the first thing I notice is the smell. Metallic & familiar but I can't put my tongue on what it is. As i enter a stall, a masked figure exits the one next to mine. The metallic smell slams me in the face & being so inebriated it doesn't occur to me that this person is covered in real blood. I slur my words and say 

"nice costume bro love the detail!! Man that Damion is so cool huh?? what a party!!" 

**silence**

The lack of words from him didnt matter to me. I didn't  even realize he didnt respond due to my current state. He could have said "fuck you guy" and I would have probably smiled. I finally relieve myself & to this day I still beat myself up for bring so blinded by all the clues in front of my face.. That smell was without a doubt blood. Regardless of human or animal it was blood. why didn't I realize this then and get as far away as possible...

I pull up my scrubs and flush the toilet. Wash my hands and exit the restroom. At this point in time whatever substance I ingested has been steadily getting me more and more fucked up by the minute. For example, it took me probably 4 minutes until I figured out how to turn the sink on...

I follow down the long and dark hallway. I take more left and rights than I thought any living space could possibly have. Still maintaining the euphoric feeling surging throughout my body I become slightly annoyed by not being able to find the stairs to the lower level or even find Damion let alone anyone else. Due to lack of good judgement, with my 200lb legs made of lead, I try to run in hopes of finding the stairs quicker. In the state I was in, alongside the baggy scrubs of my costume, I trip and crash hard and without an inch of grace into one of the many large doors with strange writing on them. Being 6'3 and 290 pounds my deadweight body causes the door to buckle and swing wide open. The first thing I see is a group of people. All wearing a black gown or something with these sinister masks on their faces. All are facing towards me. As like it was no big deal I get up and brush myself off. While I regain my balance and my vision goes back to somewhat normal I see that in the middle of the circle is a naked man. He is gagged and bound also covered in blood. 

*I think to myself wow he really did go all out for this party this is extradinary. well done Damion. Kudos to you.*

One of the masked figures approaches my direction. It passes by and shuts the door. Puts a chair under the handle so no one else can enter nor exit..Through its masked face I hear a familiar voice that I clearly recognize to be Damions say to me..

"Hello Jimmy, my boy...We have been waiting for you..The fun may finally begin...."

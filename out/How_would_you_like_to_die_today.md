“How would you like to die today?”

It was just redundant at this point; I already knew what I had to do. I ignored it and laid in bed, pretending to be asleep. But there was no point; it knew I was awake already. 

I could feel a dull ache throughout my body from yesterday when I was violently beaten to death. Now, I was as good as new, except for the soreness. 

“How would you like to die today?”

I knew it would simply keep repeating itself until I chose. I sat up and looked at the thing standing at the foot of my bed. 

It looked like a child; a little girl with long, dirty hair and a torn bow on her head. But this wasn’t a child. Children don’t make you choose how you’re going to die every single day. At least, not literally. It was too painful to look at it, it was so familiar and yet, I knew that it was just some...*thing*. An empty shell with an outward appearance that was meant to deceive me. I guess that’s just part of the torture. 

It smiled at me pleasantly while it waited for me to answer. 

“Would you like some choices?” 

“I guess.” I sighed. 

“Would you like some choices? Yes or no?”

“Yes!” I replied. 

It nodded its head once. It looked the same way in my memories. 

“Your choices for today are; strangulation, overdose, or jumping off the roof of your office building.”

I looked above its head and at my reflection in the mirror, as if that was supposed to save me from this.  

“Would you like me to repeat your choices?”

I knew I had to work late anyway today, and since I would already be at work…

“I’ll do the jump.” I replied. 

“Choice noted. You have until 11:59 pm to die. I’ll update you every two hours.”

I got ready for work, ate breakfast, and dropped my kids off at school. I was at a red light when I saw a girl on a skateboard roll out into the street as a car was passing by. The driver managed to stop the car, and the girl held onto the hood of the car as the driver honked angrily. 

“She would have died if you didn’t do this.” 

I glanced at the passenger seat and there it was; its shoes dripping mud on the floor of my car. I stared at the left one; a dirty black shoe with the missing buckle, until the car behind me honked its horn and snapped me out of my trance. 

Two years of this shit and you’d think I’d be used to it by now. 

I finally got to work and spent the rest of the day at my desk, getting reminders every two hours. I didn’t finish work until 9:30. I had less than two hours left before I had to jump off the roof. I was already falling asleep in the dark office. Everyone else had left, and the cleaning crew would get here at any minute. I must have dozed off for a while because I woke up at the last reminder. 

“You have thirty minutes left.” 

I begrudgingly got up and made my way up to the roof. It was freezing up there, and I hadn’t brought a jacket with me. Why would I need one though, if I was going to die? 

I stepped towards the edge of the roof and peered over the ledge. 

This was going to hurt like a bitch. It was way higher than the last building I had jumped from. 

I sighed and my breath formed puffs in the cold air. 

“You have fifteen minutes left.”

“I don’t want to do this anymore.” 

“Someone must die.” 

“I know. But I don’t want to do this anymore.” 

“You’re selfish; you’ve saved a lot of people who would otherwise have died.”

“I know.”

“You have twelve minutes left.”

“I don’t care.”

“This was your choice, no?”

“I’m not doing it.” 

I stepped back until I was a safe distance from the edge. 

“Someone must die. If not you, then someone else.”

“I understand that.”

“Are you okay with that?”

“Doing this was supposed to stop my daughter from dying. But it didn’t. Now, this is even worse.” I looked over at it, standing there, watching me and waiting for me to jump. 

“Are you okay with that?

“She died anyway. And then Jean left me and the kids.” 

“You have eight minutes left. Are you okay with it?”

I took a deep breath and nodded. “I’m okay with it.”

“Very well.”

I walked back down, got into my car, and drove home in silence. It didn’t appear in my car again, or at all, for the rest of the night. 

I got home and checked on the kids; my sister had put them to bed and they were fast asleep under their matching blankets. 

I changed my clothes and fell into bed. 

The next morning I woke up before my alarm went off. I kept my eyes shut for a moment, but it was quiet. I finally opened them and stared up at the ceiling, avoiding the foot of my bed, scared of it being back. 

I finally worked up the nerve to look; it was empty. 

I sighed in relief and a little bit of sadness, got up, showered, and got dressed before going downstairs. My sister had already left hours ago, and I saw Ben in the kitchen eating cereal. 

“Where’s your sister?” I asked. 

“She’s still sleeping.”

“What? Why didn’t you wake her up?” I asked, looking at the time. 

“I tried! She didn’t want to get up.”

I ran back down the hall. 

“Emilia! You need to get up now, it’s time for school.”

I walked into the room and over to the bed where I pulled the covers down, revealing her head, her curls crushed up and messy from sleep. 

“Em?” I shook her and she rolled over but didn’t get up. 

“Emilia, this isn’t funny.” 

I leaned over her and realized something. She wasn’t breathing. I stared at her, as she laid there, still. 

Behind me, I heard a familiar voice. 

“How would you like to die today?” 

I stood up straight and turned around slowly to look at it. It was even worse than I thought. It looked different now; short, messy brown curls instead of the long brown hair. It was a new face, a new *everything* entirely. I stared at it, and I couldn’t get my lips to move. 

Of course, it wasn’t over. The torture had just been turned up a notch. 

“How would you like to die today?”

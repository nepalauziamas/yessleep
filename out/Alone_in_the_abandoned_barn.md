Behind my house there’s an old barn in the middle of a field that has been abandoned and falling apart for the past 10-15 years, it was once used to place horses for a horse race track arena nearby. Anyways last summer my younger cousin came over to hang out at my house, he was always too afraid to go into the abandoned barn when I’d ask him to explore with me in the past. This time he asked me if I wanted to explore it with him I accepted his offer. 


We both entered the barn through a rusty medal door that was difficult to open, as we walked between the horse stables, all the medal doors and walls were covered with graffiti. Most of the graffiti were of satanic symbols and political slangs, there was even some graffiti displaying someone committing suicide via hanging and others were of people cutting off pieces of their body, especially the genitalia. In some areas it was almost pitch black so we used a flashlight to begin searching through different rooms, in one room we found what appeared to be a heroin needle on the floor. In another there was something more disturbing, an animal which seemed to be a possum had it’s head removed except the head was no where to be found, it was just a headless corpse laying in the middle of the room by itself. 


My cousin was beginning to become freaked out, he told me that he was going to go back to the house because he felt very uneasy in the barn. I tried to convince him to stay but he ignored and left me to explore the rest of the barn alone, as I was wandering around the dark halls, going from room to room. I began to get a call from my friend whom I’ll call “Danny”, Danny was called to tell a funny story about what happened to him while at the supermarket earlier that day, I began to laugh at his story while getting completely distracted from my surroundings. While still on the call with him I began to walk back down the halls, from about 15 feet away there was someone sticking their head through a window.


 I couldn’t tell who it was since I forgot to wear my prescription eye contacts that help me see better, I assumed it my cousin coming back to check on me. I started walking over to the figure, I was only about 8 feet away when I finally realized that the person wasn’t my cousin. It was some random guy I’d never seen before who looked to be in his mid 20’s, he had blonde hair with a pony tail. He was giving me a big death stare, I didn’t how to react so I just asked him in a confused tone “what’s up dude?” He kept staring me down for about 10 more seconds, he then pulled away from the window, and began to run around the barn, I was paranoid that he was going to ambush me from another entrance. I then heard running footsteps down one of the dark halls, getting louder and louder BOOM BOOM! BOOM!!


Before I could see him in the barn, I sprinted to and jumped out of a window nearby, landing on the field ground on my hands and knees, I quickly got back on my feet. I then began to sprint through the field back to my house, on the way, I looked behind me to see the guy staring at me through the same window I’d jumped out of with the same angry death stare, when I made it inside the house. I began to catch my breath as my cousin was sitting on the couch watching cartoons on the living room TV, he then noticed me and asked what had happened. I told him about the strange guy stalking me in the barn, when I finished explaining to him what I experienced. My cousin then told me “oh yeah, I saw that guy on top of the roof while I was leaving the barn. He was also staring at me.” I got a little annoyed asking him why he didn’t tell me that through a phone call or text message, he casually just said “I didn’t really think about it, we don’t have to worry about it now anyways”. When he told me that, I realized he had a point and sat down next to him, I called back Danny to explain why I stopped talking on the phone, then quickly forgot about it during the day.

OK... I don't know how to say this as I am really just... shaken up, nauseated... not good, to say the least.

So, exactly nine months ago today, one of my classmates, Judy, went missing, the first missing person's case in our area. This caused a lot of panic and concern among families, and it was on the news for a while. 

Around the same time, my friend started baking things. Pies, cakes, tarts... basically every dessert under the sun. I'm allergic to gluten and dairy, so I couldn't eat any. I was annoyed at first, but then I got over it. 

The next month, two kids went missing- two young boys named Micheal and Joseph. My friend kept everyone happy by baking, and gave me a small, gluten and dairy free cake she made. It tasted good, if a bit odd. It tasted nothing like any of the usual gluten and dairy free cakes I had had before, but then again, my friend was hand making them. They weren't going to taste like the store ones. 

Over the next few months, ten kids went missing, ranging from four to eighteen years old. My friend just kept baking, baking, baking, and making sure that all the treats were gone within a short amount of time, claiming that it was so nothing went stale. 

However, a couple months ago, I was round my friend's house for a sleepover. I woke up in the middle of the night due to nightmares, and I wanted a drink of water. We were sleeping in the basement, as my friend didn't want us to sleep in her room, so I had to go up the stairs to the kitchen. Because it was dark and I didn't want to wake anyone by turning the lights on, I just kept quiet as I tried to get to the kitchen while my eyes adjusted to the dark. 

I did find the kitchen, and I suddenly noticed a funny smell. There had been a humidifier in the kitchen most of the day, and I guess it had either been turned off or ran out of oils or whatever had been in there. 

By funny smell, I don't mean the lingering oils. It smelled like something had gone off. But whatever. I just needed to find a glass so I could get some water. 

I opened one of the cupboards, trying to find where the glasses were, but I opened the wrong cupboard, it seemed.

I was met by more of that funny smell, that funny rotting smell, and I guessed it was coming from whatever was inside.

I know what you're thinking- what idiot goes and investigates something they have no knowledge of?

Well. I am that idiot.

I turned on the kitchen light and went back to the cupboard. It was filled with flour, sugar, and basically every baking thing apart from eggs, milk and butter. Just my friend's baking cupboard.

However, there was a tub of... something. It kind of looked like something had been blended up, and it was nearly empty. It seemed to have been the source of the weird smell, and it was a dark red colour. It kind of looked like... blood.

I took the tub, and hid it in my overnight bag. Before I went home, I walked to the police station with it. The officer at the desk said he'd take it to the lab for testing.

A month later, my friend was arrested. It turned out, the red stuff was the blended-up remains of the most recent missing kid, a seventeen year old male named Daniel. My friend had been knocking her victims out before bringing them into her room, sexually assaulting them no matter what age or gender they were while they were still unconscious, and then killed them before chopping the body up and blending the bits of the corpses together, bones and all, and baking them into her food. She had made the townsfolk eat the kids they were trying to find.

Everyone in my area has their thoughts centered on a single event that occurred just two days ago. An event that has brought many people to tears for the sheer horror of the situation; we all lost something that day. My best friend, Andrew, died in every parent's nightmare-a school shooting.


He sent me text messages as it started until the end of his life. I couldn't stop reading them over and over again, emotions overwhelming me in waves. I can't talk to anyone about this, not even my parents-this is a very personal matter. But I need to somehow let it out, and this reddit community is the only place I know I can reach out to. That's why I've decided to transcribe my dear friend's last words to me here, completely unaltered.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The door gave way soon under my violent kicks. The sound of it smashing into the adjoining wall felt like a proper signal for my grand entrance as I stepped in and began to fill my fellow students with an onslaught of bullets. I saw my dear, best friend Andrew hit the 'send' button for his last message before gazing up at me in speechless disbelief.

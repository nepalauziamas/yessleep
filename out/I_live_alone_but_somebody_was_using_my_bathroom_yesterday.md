I’ll quickly say that I’m no George R.R Martin, I certainly can’t write to save my life, but the things that have been happening need to get out there; I’m scared and confused.

Now, I live alone in a small two-storey house. Sounds like overkill but it was only a tiny bit more expensive than the other homes near me and I’m in a band, so it was nice to have a bottom floor with room for a music studio. 
Now to preface, ever since I was young, my parents incessantly reminded me to knock on the bathroom door before opening. They say from the ages of 3-7, I had a habit of swinging it open whilst it was occupied. They became sick of it and reminded me almost every morning to knock before using the toilet; My habit of throwing the door open soon turned into one of knocking every. Single. Time. 
This might not seem important, but I thought I should mention it as it’s stuck into my adult hood, even now living on my own, and it relates to the part of the story I’m about to relay…

As I said, I live entirely on my own, and I’m the ONLY person with the keys to my home. 
Just yesterday, I woke up pretty damn early, maybe around 2am? Pretty unusual for me, but I attributed it to the feeling of my bladder bursting at the seems. I hastily jogged to my toilet, just down the hallway from my room. As per usual, I instinctively knocked on the door; Of course I expected no answer and begun to open the door… That was until I heard something that sent a chill down my spine:

“Occupied.”

My hand snapped away from the door handle, I was unsure if I was dreaming. Clearly someone has broken into my home, I thought,  but why would they use the toilet? 
“H- hello?” I awkwardly mumbled, I wanted to see if I was losing my mind, or if there really was some criminal standing on the other side of the door. 

No response.

I took a deep breath, slowly turning the handle, somewhat-ready to defend myself (I would’ve gone to grab a knife, but my kitchen is on the other side of the house, and I didn’t want to give this unknown man the ability to escape, or stage an ambush at worst). Though to my surprise, the bathroom remained empty, nobody behind the shower curtains, nobody on the toilet. I even checked to see if they had hid themselves in the little draws around the room, no human could fit in there but I was paranoid and it was 2am. After frantically searching my house for almost thirty whole minutes, I displeasingly chalked it up to my mind playing tricks on me, and went back to bed after doing my business.

This morning I checked my bathroom once again- just to be sure. Once again, completely devoid of anything but a toilet, shower, tap, and a few drawers of medicine and toilet paper. 

My day went completely normally; I ate, went and saw a movie with a friend, and came home to play some video games. What happened during tonight is what’s got me truly freaked out. I’ve been in my room this whole time, trying to get some rest, but I haven’t been to sleep; As I was lying awake, my eyes glued to the ceiling, some moonlight begun to shine through my curtains. I decided to open up a window, get some fresh air. I gently pulled my curtains open, nothing seemed out of the ordinary… that was until I noticed the man standing next to my mail box. He stood there with a cartoonish grin, illuminated by the street lamps. He wore a simple suit and a fedora, he would appear polite had I not seen him in such strange circumstances, and wearing such an uncanny smile.
I confusingly waved, not wanting to come off as rude; he simply stared at me. 
He didn’t threaten me, he didn’t appear to have a weapon, but he creeped me out to no end. I looked away for a simple moment, I don’t even remember what to look at… but once I’d looked back, he was gone… and he hasn’t been back, nor have I heard any noises. 
This happened mere minutes ago. I don’t want to call the police as nothing has happened that might require such action. But I’m feeling really freaked out, especially after yesterday’s incident. It might be dumb but I thought I’d ask you guys for any ideas…

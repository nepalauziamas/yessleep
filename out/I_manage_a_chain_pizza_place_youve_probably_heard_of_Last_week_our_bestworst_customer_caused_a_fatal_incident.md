The giant man was my least favorite customer. You could smell him come in before you saw him; nearly seven-feet tall and at least 400 pounds, the guy had a distinct smell, something like cinnamon and burning hair. I didn’t dislike the man because of his appearance or odor, though. No, I hated whenever the customer–Brad–came in because he ate his pizza like he was going to war.

Brad would settle his bulk into a corner table and then order our largest deep dish pizza to start. That was his appetizer. He liked to work his way through our Hot-N-Ready menu. If a particular item caught his attention that day, he’d order double. His mid-meal break was a triple order of Crazy Bread, an order of wings, and all of this was washed down with Diet Pepsi by the gallon.

The way Brad ate terrified children and ran off other customers. He hit the pizza harder than the Allies when they stormed Normandy Beach. Globs of sauce and chunks of crust went flying in every direction when Brad chewed. It was like someone set off a hand grenade inside of a lasagna. His shirt and cheeks and table were splattered each session before he was halfway done. Anyone sitting within a dozen feet of Brad was in danger of being struck by debris. And the sounds he made when he ate, I still have nightmares about the slurping, chomping, gurgling, moaning sounds.

Suffice to say, no one ever wanted to wait on Brad when he visited our Little Caesars. So, as the manager, that duty usually fell on me. We tolerated Brad scaring away our other customers because there really wasn’t a legal reason to ban him. That is, until one morning last week when Brad waddled into the restaurant holding a small cooler, took his usual seat in the corner, and ordered every cheese pizza that we had in the kitchen.

“Brad, I think we’ve got about eighty pizzas cooling back there,” I told him. “How many do you actually want?”

“Eighty is a good start but you’ll need to keep them coming. I have an appetite today.”

“What’s in the cooler?”

Brad grinned. His teeth were awful. “Just some toppings I brought from home.”

“We don’t really allow that.”

“Do I need to register a complaint with Little Caesars’ main office *again*?”

I sighed. “Fine. Whatever. Just don’t make a mess.”

Brad lifted his cooler onto the table and started poking around inside while I walked back to the kitchen to give them his order. When I returned with Brad’s Diet Pepsi and first pizza, I nearly gagged when the smell from his cooler hit me. Inside of the box were dozens of plastic baggies arranged around a few ice packs. The baggies were smeared with a thick, pinkish fluid and contained gray chunks of what I had to assume was meat. Whatever it was, it reeked like it was spoiled.

“You can’t eat that,” I said, setting Brad’s order on his table. “The food in your cooler has gone bad.”

Brad just smiled and popped one of the gray blobs into his mouth, then licked the pink fluid from his chin. I retreated before my stomach betrayed me. Me and the rest of the staff barricaded ourselves in the kitchen as well as we could. Every few minutes I would run another pizza out like I was charging across a battlefield dodging cannon fire. Brad’s rotten toppings and woodchipper eating style scared away most of the customers immediately. One brave family tried to stick it out sitting at the opposite end of the room. But Brad ended up choking on a slice of pizza and then coughing it up.

The wad of dough and phlegm shot over all of the tables and splattered the family. Brad started laughing, spraying more food. That was too much. I stormed over to Brad’s table as the family left in disgust.

“That’s it, you’re banned from Little Caesars,” I shouted.

Brad just continued to munch. “But I haven’t finished.”

“Finish up then. Eat as much as you want and more. But after you leave today you’re banned. Permanently.”

Brad shrugged and thrust his empty glass at me. “Refill.”

The big man continued to eat for hours. I’d never seen him tear through pizza and wings and Crazy Bread like he did that day. At one point, he slouched over and I thought he was finally done. But then he popped up and beckoned me over with one swollen hand. I didn’t know how Brad could possibly keep eating. The buttons had popped from his shirt and his belly spilled over his legs.

“I want to try some of my toppings warm,” he said, nodding towards one of the disgusting baggies. “Toss those in the microwave for me.”

“Absolutely not.”

“If you do, I promise to leave here in the next hour.”

I pulled my shirt over my nose to try to defend against the stench and gingerly picked up a baggie with a napkin. I hurried back to the kitchen, poured out the vile gunk into a bowl, and put it in the microwave. The odor was overwhelming and I knew we’d need to air out the kitchen for days to get rid of it. I immediately regretted listening to Brad’s request. Maybe it was time to call the cops and have him tossed out.

“More,” I heard him yell from the dining room. “Stack them high. And I need a refill.”

Since I was watching the microwave, my assistant manager Bianca was the one to run out the next tower of pizzas and a two-liter. The microwave beeped and I extracted the foul contents. When the steam cleared, I nearly dropped the bowl. Not because it was hot but because, outside of the little baggies, I could finally get a clear look at the “toppings” Brad had brought from home. Most were unrecognizable lumps of pink-brown but one object was unmistakably, undeniably, the bottom half of a human ear. I placed the bowl on the counter, my face cold with shock. Before I could decide how to react, there was a shriek from the dining room.

I made it to the kitchen door just as Bianca came running inside clutching her arm. At first, I thought she’d gotten pizza sauce all over her hand, there was so much red. Then I realized that all of the fingers on her left hand except for her index and thumb were gone, nothing but raw stumps.

“He ***bit*** me,” Bianca screamed. “I tried to put the pizza down for him and that monster snapped.”

I heard the sound of falling tables and a loud crash. No part of me wanted to go look but I was the manager. The staff at Little Caesars were counting on me.

“Wrap Bianca’s hand in a towel and keep pressure on it,” I instructed one of the cooks. “You, call 9-1-1,” I said to another. “We need an ambulance and the police.”

I took a breath and walked out into the dining room to find Brad on the floor. He’d fallen from his chair and knocked the contents of his table everywhere. He had half of a pizza in his mouth, his jowls trembling as he chewed, and he was crawling towards a pile of other slices.

“What did you do?” I whispered. “What is *wrong* with you?”

Brad spat out the pizza long enough to laugh. “She shouldn’t have gotten so close to my food. You don’t mess with a man’s food. *MY FOOD*. Where are the toppings?”

“What are they?”

“Friends and family. I’ve been saving them up for a while. For something special.”

Brad army crawled on his elbows, dragging his distended gut along the tiles. He made it to a nearby pile of pizza and began devouring it. His whole body looked swollen as a blood-drunk tick.

“The police are on their way, Brad.”

He nodded and started eating faster. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. The man shoveled food into his jaw, swallowing without chewing. I couldn’t help but stare. Once all of the pizza was gone, Brad lay on his belly licking his fingers.

“More,” he demanded.

“No.”

“**More**.”

For someone that big, Brad crawled fast. He came at me, pulling his bulk along with bloody fingernails. I ran, tripping over a table and crashing to the floor. There was a tug on my foot; Brad had a hand wrapped around my ankle. He dragged me towards him and I reacted on reflex, kicking out. My shoe connected with a *crack* and Brad jerked away, his nose bent at an unnatural angle.

“I said *more*,” he growled, leaning on a table to stand up.

But the table couldn’t take his weight; the stand cracked when he was halfway standing and Brad slammed into the floor gut first. There was a horrible ripping sound and I saw Brad’s eyes go blank. He tried to rise again but something was wrong. When he got to his hands and knees it became clear that his body had finally burst from the pressure and the force of the fall. His stomach had a tear right around the belly button, purple intestines, and undigested pizza all spilled out into a wet pile on the floor.

“So hungry,” Brad whispered before collapsing.

They had to bring in a professional disaster clean-up crew to dispose of the body and mop up the mess. We had to close the restaurant for forty-eight hours. To this day, Brad’s last meal remains the second or third worst shift I’ve ever had managing a Little Caesars.

And the craziest part? Corporate used their connections to hush everything up. They paid off staff and customers and squashed all media stories. A complete blackout. That’s why I had to post this; to leave at least [some record of the Incident at Little Caesars.](https://www.travisbrownwriting.com/)

 It was only when I sat on the plane that I thought about the whole case. Our new job. I stared at the flashdrive in my hand, wondering if I should check its contents. It had been given to me by someone in the office just after we had been assigned to this job. For all I knew it was just some virus. 

The man had rushed me in headquarters, mumbling, forcing the drive into my pocket. “It's not too late, run while you can. They'll send you where they want to get–” Then was the even weirder part. He was dragged away by security. I only caught a glimpse of the man's badge, *Myles West*, it read. I had the feeling that if security had seen the man hand me this flash drive, they would have taken it too. 

No one in the company saw Myles again. 

So, I was put with a new team, designated the *Delta Squad*. We had been tasked by HQ to harvest artifacts, stone samples, and so on from a private, underwater cave system in Italy, and we were on our way there. 

My team is Alison West, Riley Arnold, Jared Parker, and myself, Alex Earndale. We had been given a briefing about this secret location. It was a historical site of some sort, on the verge of being owned by some other corp. 

Jared and I are sort of fill-in-the-gap guys. I know weapons, radio systems, and other miscellaneous things. Jared is our resident Latin expert, and had a bit of tech knowledge of his own. Riley is our dedicated tech though. Alison is our pilot, brawn, and leader.

I like all of them. I've been on OPs with Jared before, but not the others before this. Riley was nice enough and Alison didn't care much if we called her, ‘Sir’, ‘Ma'am’, or any of that. “Just Alison,” she said.

“And if you were smart, you'd just throw that drive away. He's always been crazy.” She said when I asked her about Myles. Apparently he was one of Alison's uncles, a raven by all accounts. I don't know why, but I held onto the flash drive. 

HQ was serious about this job, as they had given us some pretty high tech stuff. The biggest among these were the suits we were fitted into. They were the real sci-fi sort of thing, full body suits with all sorts of functions. They had flashlights, comms, night vision, additional strength, and the ability to support us underwater in pressurized places. That's just some of it though. The suits had a sort of failsafe too, that if enough of their onboard battery was used, they'd shut all ‘unnecessaries’ off to give an hour of life support. 

About the briefing. Apparently at some point back in Roman times there were groups, cults really, that fled into caves to create offshoot civilizations. No one knows whether these people were actual Romans or not, or why they fled. They thought that they would be safe from something if they built their towns down there. That's right, underground cave cities. We all simply assume that they were flooded later on by earthly shifting.  

The cave systems had been dated to Roman times through archaeological and anthropological evidence. A spelunker and cave diver, David Werner, had found the cave and sparked HQ's interest with it. Once they discovered it was some sort of unique underground, underwater area this person readied to dive with a team. 

They were quite surprised at what they found down there and took pictures of the sprawling underground city. It has one central feature: a temple of sorts, painted with ancient murals and Latin phrases. Who knows how all of this survived erosion, but it was there. In fact, the temple was a sort of air pocket where the water did not reach. The divers had taken several photos and resurfaced.

HQ's top scientists were worried it would be some sort of branch language, but it turned out to be traditional Latin in the murals, just fanciful script that might take a minute to read. The anthropology department also suggested that these images have ties to different cultist behaviors around the world, but more research is required, hence our explorations. 

The caves had been put on the back burner for some time, until recently, when they were outbid to renew rights on the land. I'm not sure how any of that works, all I know is that HQ wants to be the first to discover the most obvious aspects before they lose it. Our squad would be some of the first to walk there since ancient times. Groups had been sent around the area to investigate though, mainly asking the surrounding locals at the chance of legends about this place. 

Locals did have stories. Old ones, ones that have the strange air around them when they're told. If a local heard whispers of these stories being told to our agents, they would leave, as if they'd catch bad luck. 

The boil down of the tales went something like this, “Don't go into the ancient cities, don't take anything, don't wish for anything. The first names of the first borns. Otherwise, it will only be death below.”, “The silken blood, from the first names of the first borns…”, and yada yada. They liked that one phrase a lot, ‘death below’. 

The locals admitted that they didn't really know what the stories meant, as several cities had been found and looted to no consequences long ago. Of course in this field, it's not uncommon for these warnings to pop up, and despite these, HQ sent us out, the first recovery squad to fully capture the ruins. To gather as many artifacts, videos, and images as possible. 

When the executive had shown us what current evidence was available, he also told us about the cave diver's advice, *“Don't go down there, the caves* ***are inhabited*** *by something”*, *“Don't go into* ***the citadel****”*. He had us reference an image he had taken in the ruins proper. There were blips in the dark that could almost be seen as eyes, or a figure maybe. These were what had started the rumors when some of the evidence leaked, *there's something down there*.

That cave diver said other things, but I just ignored them at the time. Things about how there were tunnels in the walls that figure used to chase him outside. Nonsense, I thought. 

“We need you to go into the caves and recover the artifacts shown here. Take more clear pictures and video of the murals and upload them to us through our high-depth connection systems.”

We did what we were told, and here we are.

“I still have a bad feeling about all of this.” Jared said as we flew on the plane. 

“We'll be fine,” This was Riley. “We've been fine all of the other times. Egypt, Mexico, you name it.”

“I don't know, something just seems off about this one is all. I don't like the stories about something hiding in the caves. What if it's waiting for us?”

“Well, next time we go into a pyramid I'll pack some bug spray for the locusts. Come on, Jared.” I said. 

Alison looked over the pilot's seat, “Quiet down back there. We're going to land soon.”

I tucked the flash drive away. Whatever it had on it, it could wait until the ride home.

When the plane landed we then drove across the Italian countryside. There wasn't much time to enjoy the colorful sights. We made it to the area that afternoon. There were security teams at the borders who let us in, private property signs staked throughout. They drove us up to the mountain baseline before we had to hike.

It was quite a trip to make it there, moving through heavy foliage and steep mountains, but in the end we made it. The mouth of the cave was not so obvious. If it wasn't for the map and pictures HQ had given us, we might not have found it for hours. 

We had to shimmy in one by one, then climb down a cliff inside that descended into the mountain itself. It seemed ancient stairs had been carved here, pathways too, but they had long since collapsed or eroded.  

“Headcams on still?” Alison asked. She gained an affirmative from all of us.

Suddenly, there was some kind of loud rumble above. If it wasn't for our full helmets with local comms installed, we may not have heard Alison's warning. 

“Small cave-in– move to the left side here, quickly.” 

As she said it, a few hand sized stones crumbled from the cliff. It took a moment for the dust to settle so that we could see. It seemed the entrance itself had sealed somehow.

“What the hell?” I muttered. “What caused that? Did anyone feel an earthquake or something?”

There had been a sort of rumble, now that I thought about it. It didn't seem to be earthquake material though.

“Nothing for me.” Riley said, checking a reader on her wrist. 

“Well, that's exactly why we bring the power drills. Are they ready to go?” Alison said. 

Riley pulled her pack from her shoulders and looked inside. She unfolded the high tech drill, and it flashed a red light, “Dead…”.

“Damn it, Jared. Why isn't the drill charged?” Alison said. 

Jared went to rub the back of his neck, but his 

suit blocked him, “Yeah… sorry about that.”

“And *that* is exactly why we bring generators.” Riley said. 

“Come on then, let's get moving. We can charge the drill at camp while we dip our toes in.” Alison said.

The caves were just as creepy as they looked in the few pictures, weirder even, almost like something alive was petrified. The tunnels deeper in were tall and round, as if burrowed out by some giant worm long ago. Several smaller holes and tunnels covered the walls in a strange pattern. I'm no geologist, but it looked perhaps volcanic. Sometimes the cave ceilings were just tall enough we couldn't even see them with our helmet lights. Some sections had almost Egyptian-like carvings and story murals too.

Even though these high tech suits were protecting us from the underground pressure, I could feel it like eyes on my back. 

After an hour's walk or so, we were deep enough to start feeling anxious about the whole thing. I didn't have time to feel the jetlag either.

We found a flat area and set up our base. I was calibrating some diving equipment there as everyone else went about their own business. The folding tech drill charged beside us. 

We had quite the loadout. Rifles and ammunition, tech like HDCs, suit repair products, generators, sleeping areas, diving gear, and rations. HQ sure was serious about this. None of my equipment was cooperating much though. The radio and HDC, high-depth connection, beeped at me with some kind of repeating error.

“Hey, Jared, got any ideas what's going on here?” I gestured at the equipment, the calibration giving chaotic feedback to my headset. I would've called on Riley, but her and Alison were busy away from camp where the water started.

“Don't think it's gonna work again. There ain't much signal down here.”

“Damn it,” I smacked the radio as it buzzed louder. 

“Best just turn that thing off. Save our generator power,” Jared said. “There's no way we're connecting to home base again.”

HQ had said this radio was good for deep cavern travel up to two miles, hence its name, and we weren't that far under. They said it was necessary that we keep communication open at all times, upload the pictures and so on. Well it seems that they had screwed it up. Our proximity helmet comms worked, and our long distance radios. Just not our deep cavern connection to HQ. 

I clicked the off switch and pulled its cords from the generators. Jared glanced off to the side, and then I heard it. Footsteps creeping up to camp. 

“So,” Alison began, walking into sight. “You get that connection working yet?”

“No,” Jared and I said together. 

“Not down here past the gates of hell.” Jared said.

“Where's Riley? Didn't you assign yourself to her today?” I asked.

“She's still off setting up lights at the water. We've been down there for a while, but she said it would be a few hours at least. I just came back to get a few adapters for her.”

“I don't know how she stands it, being down there all alone.” Jared said.

“She really *shouldn't* be down there alone, right? Isn't that against protocol, boss? Why didn't you just radio us?” I said. 

She glanced down at the radio I had been working on. “Doesn't seem to be in working order.”

I held her eye and tapped the radio on my shoulder. All of ours gave the fuzzy click of reception. “Hey asshole, these ones still work.” I said. 

“Careful what you say to your superior…” Alison growled.

A moment later we heard Riley. “Delta two here. No messing around on official channels please, Delta four. Glad you got the radios working. Where's our beloved leader, Delta one? I need those adapters. Over.” 

“Delta four here. Thank you for the advice and well wishes, Delta Two. The prodigal leader is on her way. Over and out.”

“Should we really keep leaving Riley? I'm worried about the stories. Everyone thinks we're crazy for taking this job.”

“Oh relax, Jared,” I teased. “Don't tell me you're still going on about it.”

Jared shrugged, glancing behind himself. “We both saw the same pictures, right? I only believe what seems reasonable. Those weird murals and buildings down here don't seem right. Not to mention that thing in the last image. That diver *saw* things down here, Alex. Things using those holes in the wall as tunnels to get around you, he said.” 

“As long as we follow protocol, we'll be fine.” I said.

“Protocol? You mean like communication with the surface or bust?” Jared said.

“What, you wanna abandon the whole mission? Leave this cash to someone else?”

Alison interrupted us. “Boys, enough. You're like kids sometimes, I swear to God… My babysitting days are over. That's an order.” 

Silence followed Alison's words, me messing with the last preparations while Jared glared at me. Then there was a sound. The three of us looked towards it. It had come from deeper in the cave it seemed, though it was hard to tell. A distant crash followed a moment later.

“Tell me you heard that,” Jared said. “It sounded like some kind of scream, didn't it?” 

I clicked comms. “Riley, you there? Over.” 

We waited for Riley to answer. When we were just about to give up, a garbled version of her voice chimed something unintelligible. There was also a strange residue in the background noise, a sort of soft whir, some malfunction maybe?

“She's probably just out of range. So who wants to go help her out?” Alison said.

“You're the one that should be over there anyway.” I mumbled.

Alison's smile was sarcastic, clear even through her helmet visor.

“Great, I'm glad you're so eager, Alex. Please, why don't you go on ahead? It seems that you get a break from this equipment for now.”

“Some leader you are…” I mumbled.

“Well the choices are a bit limited aren't they? For instance you couldn't lead a balloon by the string. By the way, she needs those adapters.” She said.

“Don't look at me. I freely admit that I'm scared.” Jared said.

I sighed. “Fine. I just hope you know you're a bundle of dicks…”

I stood up and gathered some of my gear and the adapters. I kept the flashdrive in a waterproof pocket. I don't know why, really. It was probably the best intuition I had that day. 

I grabbed my scanner, cameras, a more powerful flashlight, my diving gear backpack, and a weapon. This was when Alison chimed in again. 

“I thought you weren't scared of anything? Why don't you leave that behind then?”

I guess I had caught her in the wrong mood that day.

“I can go with you if you're scared. It is protocol after all to have a buddy.” Jared teased.

“Fine,” I put my rifle down. “You giddy little assholes stay here then. I'm gonna bring some of this other stuff to get some captures while I'm down there, like *protocol* demands.” and I headed off, into the seemingly endless caverns. 

\~

I studied the cave walls as I walked. I hadn't been able to understand their vast size until I had been sent there myself. I thought about the stories as I went. The drifting figure that the diver had said climbed in the walls, and the origins of these ruins. 

The pictures showed the sprawling city in chaotic design, carved stones and pyramids laid out in underground townships. Though the obvious reason for exploring these places was for historic documentation, something had always seemed off even to me, happy as Jared was to hear it later. 

I wasn't a treasurer for HQ, but we all knew what kinds of millions must surge through the company's accounts. There was something here that someone rich was looking for, and we were the stick they were poking the hive with. 

The sound of my footsteps seemed to offend the silence. I was starting to feel naked without my rifle despite myself. Questions did arise in me then, like, *“Why do we need weapons at all?”*, *“Why force us to establish live comms?”*. The stories of a figure crawling on the walls, traveling through the countless holes was not a welcome companion. At least the pay would be good… *was* good.

I eventually made it to where I could see Riley's floodlight set up and hear the soft whir of the generators. Seems this is what her and Alison have been doing. Several lights were mounted near a mouth leading into the water. Some lights hadn't quite been set up yet, and others simply weren't plugged in. I could see the distant structures through the glass-like surface, shadows of old bones long submerged. It was the city. Though it was made harder by a churning mess of silt. 

Riley's no amateur. She wouldn't have brushed the floor and disturbed the door like that on her own. It made me uneasy.

This place was so large even Riley's six hundred thousand lumens beaming through the water couldn't reach it all. It helped a considerable amount though, despite the silt.

“Hello? Riley?” I radioed out. The area was empty.

My words would have echoed without my helmet, I was hoping she would pick up the local comms. Despite that, I thought that I could almost hear an echo. My eyes had adjusted to the lights and I saw one of them was knocked over. It looked like it had been dragged partly down, into the water, leading into the mouth. Strangely though, there were no missing sets of diving gear. I hadn't thought much of it at the time. 

I could see another one of the lights farther into the ruins. In the middle of the paved streets in fact, illuminating buildings inside as it flickered. I clicked the long distance radio.

“Riley? You here or what?” There was no answer, besides that strange echo from the radio. Not even Jared or Alison chimed in. Then there was that strange audio residue. Though this time it was when *I* had clicked on the radio.

I set my headlamp to max brightness. That might burn through the battery, but I needed it. I thought about going back to Jared and Alison. I didn't. I should have.

I unpacked my diving gear bag, attached the necessary components to my suit, and readied myself to set off into the water.

“Here goes nothing.” I said, and dove in. 

There was a slight hill that led down into the city. The air seemed to thrum beyond the water pressure now on me. I swam across the infinity of darkness and soon made it to the light dragged down into the road. I paddled just above it. Seeing it clearer now, it had long marks across the metal. 

So it really had been dragged all the way here. The light itself was on its side, aimed towards the central building of town, *the citadel*. Its shadow flickered with the light.

I looked up at this building. It was an almost Mayan looking temple. Though I didn't study it long when I saw the figure, paddling at the top of the stairs there. No, they were actually just standing there normally, as if there wasn't any water at all. I should have realized something was up.

“Riley?” I said over radio. “It's me, Alex.” 

“Alex? It's me– help me!” She said back. 

It was odd, the voice almost didn't seem to come from the figure on the steps, but where else could it have come from?

My heart was racing, but I just assumed it was from relief. I swam down the street and towards the center. It was far enough to take me a few minutes to get there. As I came closer, I felt a further sinking in my chest. I knew something was telling me to paddle away as fast as I could, but I ignored it. Riley had waited on the steps for me I thought, but when I made it to the top of the stone overlook, no one was there. 

Just like the diver had said, the central part of this cathedral was a sort of air bubble. I had to swim through a small tunnel that led down until I surfaced in the mural chamber that we had seen in the pictures.

“Riley–” 

Then I saw the blood. 

I followed the trail. I pulled my knife. It was all I had. 

The sheer size of this place was intimidating in person. I didn't have long to admire the murals. On the wall, there were nine of those eight sided crosses, lined up in tandem with symbols above each. A group of four, and a group of five. Strung up on five of these were bodies, long dried blood trailing down the crosses. Their arms and legs… they were split down the center to fill all eight branches of the crosses. 

I didn't recognize any of them, but they were long dead, and all wore agent's uniforms like ours. What did this mean?

Then I saw Riley, hung in the second group and second from the right. She was still whole, luckily, and called out to me. 

“Alex? Help– me.”

I ran up and climbed a podium that led to the crosses. It was bad. Riley was hung by ropes around her wrists and shoulders. It was clear something had attacked, damaging the softer parts of her armor. She had sorts of claw-like marks across her leg and side. I tried to untie her bonds. 

“What happened?” I asked. My radio was on the fritz again with that strange residue.

“I was setting up lights. Something… grabbed me and attacked. It pulled me and a light all the way down here, slashing us both. I would've drowned without my helmet, I didn't have any diving gear on. I tried to run but– it hung me here. I think it's still nearby…”

Riley's words trailed off. She looked up as my radio crackled. I had only been able to free Riley's left shoulder, then stopped. Something dark dribbled onto my forehead from above. It was old, viscous blood. I looked up too. 

A dark silhouette smiled at me. A long, scaly smile and bright eyes. It spoke in a ragged and slow tone as if the speech was unfamiliar. It sent shivers down our spines.

“Like my work?”

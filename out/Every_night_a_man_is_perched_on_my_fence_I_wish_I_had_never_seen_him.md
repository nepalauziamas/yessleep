 

I’m guessing you’re here because you read the title of this post. I’m writing this with my phone’s brightness as low as it can to get my mind off what is happening.

I’ve been living in my current home for almost 5 years now with my cat and I used to live with my girlfriend but things got ugly and she left me. So, I’ve lived alone for about a year with only my cat. 

What is happening only started about a month ago, that’s when I noticed but it could have been going ok for longer. I noticed when my cat Cleo went missing. I had assumed it was just her walking about donde I let her wander outside and she had always come home. It was the first of November and it was late and I was waiting for cleo. It was taking her longer than usual to get back, but I just assumed she had seen something that interested her. It was at 10pm I decided to go to bed and use the camera I have outside that can connect to my phone with Bluetooth to see when she gets back so I could let her in. 

By the time I had gotten into bed and opened my phone to look at the camera for a little bit before bed to see if she was at the door. That’s when I saw it for the first time. I was only able to see it’s face it looked like a gaunt man like someone who is starving. It’s face was so pale and it had its eyes open so wide I could see the veins clearly. It was smiling…that smile it still haunts me. It was too wide and its teeth… its teeth were huge bigger than I had ever seen on a normal person. They were wet from what I could tell with something dark. 

And I could tell with how clearly I could see its head ,that it was tall. I can tell because my house was built on a wooded hill and I have a 6 foot privacy fence that’s made of wood boards, but with the hill on the side it was on it would have to have been 8 feet tall to be seen that clearly. Then it looked right into the camera. Right at me, and raised its hand and waved at me in its hand was cleo with what looked like bites taken out of her guts. 

Then it turns and left walking into the woods eating clean like she was a stick of beef jerky for it to snack on. This whole thing only lasted 12 seconds but it felt like hours. Staring at that thing’s smiling face. I called the police immediately after I mustered up enough courage to close the camera app making sure that thing was gone. I told them a homeless guy was on my property and killed and was eating my cat. They wouldn’t have believed me if I told them that a monster was on the other side of my fence and ate my cat. 

When they had arrived I showed them the footage. They thought it was a messed up joke but still agreed to search the area. It took them 20 minutes. They said they found a trail but it ended up not really leading anywhere. They left and said if he came back to call them. I have their number now. It hasn’t helped. I'm still scared for my life in my bathroom hiding for it. They had left 30 minutes ago.

It continued like this for the next few weeks but I stopped calling the cops since nothing came up every time I called and he only stayed on the other side of my fence. After those weeks of him standing on the other side of my fence staring at my camera. He came back like he always does but he wasn’t on the other side of the fence. He was perched on my fence.

He was just on my fence. He had his feet apart and was grabbing the fence between his feet with his hands. 

I could finally see his entire body, he was tall and looked like he was starving I could see his ribs under his skin, his arms and legs were unnaturally long and his hands and feet were the biggest I have ever seen on a person and his hands were covered

In blood. He was still smiling his disgusting smile,but his eyes were different this time. Instead of wide like before they weren’t there just empty bloody sockets. He wasn’t looking at the camera this time he was looking through my living room window. 

When I saw him I was laying on my couch in the living room with the curtains closed. Then I heard him, he was laughing. I could hear it from inside but faintly it was the most haunting thing I have ever heard. I wanted to look out the window and see him but I was terrified to think of what he would do to me. I saw what he did to cleo what he could do to me.

When he was perched on my fence no matter how long I watched him through the camera he never left. Eventually I was able to fall asleep somehow. When I woke up he was gone just like before. He kept coming back and perching on my fence for a few weeks. Until one day when I decided to visit my mom since she didn’t live that far from me and I needed to get away from my house. I couldn’t stay here with him there any more. I need to see if he would go away if I wasn't there. 

That was a big mistake. I had checked my camera before going to bed at my mother’s house which took me longer to get to than normal. Normally it is a 20-30 minute drive with no traffic but today it took almost an hour with no traffic. I managed to get here though. When I checked my camera I wasn’t greeted with that thing perched on my fence. He was in my yard staring right at the camera with his face as close to it as he could get. 

I saw this and screamed, dropping my phone and I could see on my screen when I looked back he had run off and was out of sight by the time my mother came back to ask me why I was screaming, I just told her a raccoon was close to the camera and it scared me. I didn’t check my camera again for the three days I was with my mother.

That leads up to today. I had gotten home from my mother’s and was laying in my bed again when I decided to check my camera. He was there again, I had decided I had had enough so, I went downstairs to at least see him with my own eyes. I looked through my living room window since I had the straightest shot to the stairs and somewhere I could hide. He was there and he looked worse than he did when I saw him on camera. He looked me in the eye with his empty sockets and started laughing like an insane asylum patient. It was so loud I could clearly hear it even though he was 15 feet away from me. I could hear it like he was next to me. 

I ran.

I wish I didn’t because the moment I did he jumped off the fence and ran to my back door. I could hear it as he ran across my yard. I ran upstairs to my room and hid in my bathroom with the lights off and now we’re here with me writing this. I heard him break my back door down it was dead bolted but he was able to break it open somehow. I only know he did because I could hear the door breaking as he forced it open.

I can hear him coming up the stairs and he is laughing so loudly. If anything happens and I have the chance I’ll update you on it .

Update:

He found my room, he was moving so slowly, I could hear him standing at my bedroom door laughing every 15 minutes he would take a step closer. He’s at my bathroom door now laughing. I heard him speak, he said he knew I was in here in the most hoarse voice I have ever heard. It sounded like he was smoking for decades. He is banging on the door. I can hear it breaking. I guess the only thing I can do now is say goodbye.

Mom I’m sorry I should have been better. Cleo I should have taken better care of you. Amelia I’m sorry I shouldn’t have said what I did. Please forgive me… I love you all.

This is the end of the line for me. The door is open and he is standing in the open doorway laughing. 

To anyone left reading this it's too late for me.

Goodbye

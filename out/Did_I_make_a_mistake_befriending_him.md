I recently started a new job at a jewelry store. It's been a month and I really like it here. I even made a friend, his name is Matthew and we share a shift every Monday, Thursday and Friday. 

Matthew is in his mid 20s and is a pretty nice guy with his likes and hobbies. Only thing is, he never eats. I've never seen him eat on his break unlike everyone else. At first it weirded me out but I guess everyone has their habits. 

There are times where he'll excuse himself to go to the bathroom and stay there for 20-30 minutes. Whenever he's questioned about it, he simply brushes it off. 

Another thing I've noticed is that sometimes his eyes go completely black and his skin will become extremely pale. I've seen this happen 2-3 times now and it has completely freaked me out. The third time I saw it, I questioned it but he laughed and said that I have an incredible imagination. 


Nonetheless, we get along well. 


Well, he recently invited me to have dinner at his house. I obviously accepted it and was really looking forward to it.  A day before said dinner, a coworker went missing. Her name was Amanda. The last one who saw her was Matthew but even he didn't know what had happened. 

Yesterday was the dinner. I went to his house, he lives in this 4 story apartment building on the second floor. The place was lovely, if you exclude that awful smell that emitted from a room with a slightly open door.

We chatted while eating, sharing stories and experiences. I excused myself to go to the bathroom. He was hesitant at first but eventually he showed me the way to the bathroom. 

I passed the room with the awful smell and peaked out of curiosity into it. I had to hold myself as I saw Amanda's body just laying on the floor with a few parts missing. I rushed to the bathroom and silently cried. I was so shocked I couldn't do anything else. 


After I was done, I made my way back to the kitchen. Halfway there, I saw a glimpse of something I can't even begin to describe. It was a humanoid thing with pale skin and black soulless eyes. Accompanying it was a set of huge black wings and it looked as if it was feasting on a leg. 

As soon as it felt my presence I assume, it transformed back to Matthew. He innocently smiled at me before asking me if I wanted dessert. I immediately declined and collected my things before running for the door. 

Before I could open the door, he, or it, was back to the previous form. It grabbed me by the shoulders and yelled at me to let nobody know of this or else I was next. 


Needless to say I ran as fast as I could. Today is Friday and it showed up at the store like normal and greeted to me as if the events of yesterday never occurred. 

I want to say something but what if I end up like Amanda? What if I end up becoming  it's next meal?

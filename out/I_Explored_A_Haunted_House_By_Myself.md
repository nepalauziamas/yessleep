"Come on, there has to be something I can do tonight," I mumbled, looking around on my phone.

It was a boring Friday night, and I didn't have anything to do because everyone else was at a school dance.

But I didn't have anyone to go with, so I decided to stay home and mess around on my phone.

Now I'm a big horror fan I had a bunch of different horror movies and books in my room, and when I could, I would chat about horror stuff.

Not very many people enjoyed horror things like I did, and that's why I didn't have a girlfriend or many friends.

Some people called me a goth or even a werido, and I was used to it.

I was watching TV with my phone next to me I was trying to watch something that wasn't horror related, but I couldn't help it.

Just then, my phone rang, and I picked it up, knowing it was my only friend, John.

" Hello?" I asked, sounding a bit annoyed.

John knew I didn't like it when he called while I was watching things, but he was my only friend.

He shared my love for horror, but it seemed like everyone else liked him more than me.

" Hey Victor, did you hear the news? Remember that house that's a few blocks from your house?" John's voice asked.

"Yeah, what about it?" I asked him.

"You should go check it out. I mean, you have nothing else to do, and besides, if you do, you are going to be famous at school," John explained.

Then it hit me: there was an old house that was near where I lived that everyone said was haunted.

I had bragged to a couple of my schoolmates that I would explore it and post about my experience on the internet.

I then told John I had to go and hung up on him before jumping up. I had a mission now.

I then ran over and grabbed my backpack that was laying on the ground next to my door.

There were a few things already packed into the bag, like a flashlight and a few other things.

" I hope I don't get arrested for doing this," I mumbled under my breath.

I put the backpack on and grabbed the flashlight before heading downstairs into the main room of the house.

I told my dad that I was going to the dance and he asked if he could drive me, but I told him I wanted to walk.

Before he could come ask me, I headed out of the house and into the night.

The flashlight, which I had turned on, bounced in my hand as I walked, making the light from it bounce too.

I walked for a few minutes, thinking about the house and its history.

Everyone said that an old couple lived there together, just the two of them.

But then one day, they disappeared, and no one knew where they went.

After that, everyone who's tried to live in that house has been scared out by what they call ghosts.

A few minutes later, I got to the house, and when I saw it, a big nervous lump went down my throat.

The house had two floors, which made it creepy for some reason, and there was also a big ornate door that was just screaming my name.

I then headed up the front steps, making a creaking sound every time I stepped on one.

When I reached for the door knob to test to see if it was locked, the door suddenly opened all by itself.

That made me jump back in fear and I also tripped down the stairs. I looked around trying to see if there was any wind blowing.

But there wasn't the door that had opened on its own, like it was telling me to come inside.

" Maybe this was a bad idea." I thought to myself, thinking about going back home.

But then I thought about what would happen if I went to school and told everyone I was too scared to go into the house.

Without another thought, I walked into the house with my bag and my flashlight.

The light bounced off the walls and I noticed the furniture was still inside the place, which made me wonder.

I then noticed there was a picture on the wall next to me, and I threw my flashlight on it.

It was a picture of the couple, but for some reason, the lady wasn't smiling. She looked nervous.

" Go away!" A voice behind me shouted.

I jumped out of fear again like an idiot, and I dropped the flashlight and grumbled under my breath.

I bent down and picked up the flashlight before turning around and trying to see who told me to go away.

But no one was there and I rolled my eyes before I headed off. I had my phone on and was starting to film my trip.

"Ok, so I'm on the first floor looking for something creepy," I said into the phone.

I aimed my phone and flashlight around in the same area, and then I headed into the living room.

I noticed all the stuff was in the living room, like the rest of the house, and then I saw a notepad laying on a side table near the couch.

I laid the flashlight down and grabbed the notepad with my free hand. There was enough light from my phone to where I could actually read it.

If anyone is reading this, then my death wasn't an accident.

"Wasn't it an accident?" I mumbled, looking around the dark room.

I put the notepad down and aimed my phone around the room, trying to see if I could find anything.

Suddenly, I heard a very loud scream, which made me jump, and I felt my heart jump too.

" What the heck?" I said, looking around the room.

I then grabbed my flashlight before running out of the living room and into the front hall area.

I still had my phone in my hand, but I didn't feel like filming anything else right now.

I looked over my shoulder and noticed that the front door of the house was still open.

I was thinking about just leaving the house and going back home, but I wanted to stay longer.

Then my brain started fighting; one side was telling me to go home before something awful happened.

But the other side was telling me to stay a bit longer and look around more.

And guess which side of my brain won I stood there looking at the stairs, wondering if I wanted to go up them.

I knew the stairs were probably really old and could break under my weight, but then I heard that freaky scream again.

As fast as my legs could carry me, I climbed up the stairs and stopped when I got up, and then I noticed all the rooms.

I tried to tone in the screams but I couldn't hear anymore, but I noticed something else. A door was open.

I headed over and peeked into the room, noticing it was a bedroom, so I headed into the room.

I looked around with my flashlight and noticed all the bedroom stuff, and then the lights turned on and I looked around confused.

Then I spotted someone there. Standing behind me was a man in a mask.

It was one of those horror movie masks, and I noticed he was holding a big hunting knife.

" Who are you?" I asked, fear raising up in my voice.

The man didn't say anything, but he put a finger to his lips and then pointed behind me, and I foolishly turned around.

There standing in the doorway was an old lady, but I knew it had to be a ghostÂ 

She had black and gray hair, but she was wearing a nightgown that looked bloody.

My mouth fell open and she smiled darkly at me, showing me old and rotting teeth and demon red eyes.

"W-who are you?" I asked, scared.

"That's irrelevant; what matters is why you're in my house!"The ghost yelled.

" I just wanted to look around and check it out," I said, holding the flashlight tightly in my hands.

" You humans have no right to come here! Leave or I will make you leave!" She yelled at me.

I turned to look at the masked man but noticed he was gone, and then that's when my heart dropped.

Suddenly, I threw my flashlight at the ghost and watched as it went right through it.

The ghost laughed before darting at me somehow, and I don't know how to explain it, I got out of the way.

I then ran without grabbing the flashlight. I didn't need to do anything stupid. I just needed my life.

What was the ghost going to do if it caught me? I didn't want to find out.

And where did that masked man go before I had time to ask? I was outside of the house.

I bent over, breathing heavily, as I was standing on the sidewalk, and I then looked around.

I noticed it was still nighttime, but I knew it was going to be morning soon.

So I ran home, and when I got back, I headed upstairs to my room without even thinking about being quiet.

I sat down on my bed, putting my hand on my heart, and I could feel it beating fast.

Suddenly, my phone beeped, telling me I had a message, and I was confused.

Did John stay up to ask me how my trip went? I didn't want to look at it, but I decided to anyways.

When I turned my phone on, the message popped up, and it was a picture of my flashlight that I had left.

Did you forget something? That was what the picture said.

My mouth fell open in shock and the phone dropped from my hand. If I had seen that ghost, then who had taken the picture? Everyone knew ghosts couldn't hold things or touch things.

Suddenly, it hit me like a brick hit me in the face. That masked man must have been, but still, who was he and how did he get my phone number?

I didn't want to think about it, so I put my phone away and then waited until the next day.

After that, when I went to school, people asked me about my trip to that haunted house, and I didn't want to tell them anything.

No one seemed to care that I almost got killed by a ghost or stabbed by a masked person, and I think that was a good thing.

Anyway, a few weeks later, I was actually walking home from school and decided to go check out the creepy house.

When I got there, I noticed a moving truck in the driveway and I felt confused about it.

I walked up closer and then noticed some big movers guys moving things into the house, and I felt the same feeling as when I went into the house.

Suddenly, a lady walked over to me with a big smile on her face and a bright green dress on.

" Why hello there, young man, it's nice to meet you," the lady said.

" Um - are you moving into that house?" I asked pointing at the house.

" Why yes, me and my husband love it. This neighborhood is so wonderful and when we heard this house had a sale price, we just had to buy it," the woman explained, grinning.

I grinned nervously, thinking about the ghost and masked man I saw wanting to tell this lady and her husband about it.

I told her I had to go and look up the window, and then I noticed that someone was standing at the window.

I couldn't tell who it was, but I noticed they were waving at me with a dark and gross grin on their face.

And then, without another word, I ran off down the street. The house was someone else's problem now.

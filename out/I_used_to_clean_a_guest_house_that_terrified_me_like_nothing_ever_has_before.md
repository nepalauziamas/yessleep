When I (23F) was 17, I was saving up for a backpacking trip and decided to get a second job. My dad happened to know a woman who owned a wedding venue and was looking for someone to do odd jobs around the property. For the sake of anonymity, we will call the woman “Megan”. 

From the moment I met Megan, I loved her. Truly, she was an amazing boss. I had absolutely no experience with any of the things she asked me to do, and looking back I was a slow and, (in my opinion) useless employee, however she payed me extremely well and really liked me. Tending to the garden, babysitting her 5-year old daughter, feeding the horses, painting fences, talking down brides having a mental breakdown, I was up for anything.

Except when it came to the guest house. 

The guest house was a beautiful new building situated above the horse stables. The bridesmaids and bride to be would stay there the night before the wedding, and the next night the bride and groom would stay there. They could look out the window and see the shimmering pond and the horses grazing in the field while eating a huge fresh breakfast that Megan would make with eggs from the chickens and veggies from the garden. It was truly beautiful. 

Yet every time I was sent to clean after they left, I was paralyzed with fear. 

All my life I have been a very independent person who prefers to be on my own, so this kind of job is right up my alley, but from the first moment I stepped in there I got an acute feeling that something wasn’t right. The best comparison I can think of is when you are out alone and a man approaches you, and he has this hungry look in his eyes like he wants something, and you get a sinking feeling in your gut and a heartbeat in your ears and you suddenly feel very exposed. 

I tried to shake this feeling off. Honestly, I felt embarrassed. This was such a beautiful, bright guest house with all new furnishings. There was nothing creepy about it at all. But the longer I stayed, the worse it got. 

The worst of all was the bathroom, because when I scrubbed the bath my back was to the door, and I could feel something behind me. Goosebumps would cover my arms and my heart would race, but every time I turned around there would be nothing there. 

I would clean as fast as I could, but that presence behind me was so strong it felt suffocating. I know it might sound crazy, but I was not alone. Something was watching me, and whatever it was did not like me. 

Every week, the feeling got stronger. I began to dread coming in to work. I had nightmares. But I never told Megan. How could I? I never actually saw anything scary in the guest house. 

One time in particular, when I was cleaning the tub, the feeling got so bad that I whipped around and ran as fast as I could down the stairs and outside. I stood out there gasping for breath. I felt like I had almost died, even though really, nothing had happened at all.

When my backpacking trip approached and I handed in my notice, Megan asked to take me out to dinner. We had a great time talking about some of the crazy weddings we had that summer, and then she suddenly got serious. She said that now that I was leaving, she had to tell me something. 

She told me that I lasted the longest out of anyone she’d ever known cleaning the guest house. I went completely still and asked her why. 

She said that in the past 2 years (since the venue has been opened) she has had many strange complaints about the guest house. Megan’s best friend used to clean it but would only do it with her husband, claiming that it terrified her for a reason she couldn’t explain. She also had a bride and groom say that the venue was lovely, but their was something very negative in the guest house. Worst of all, Megan told me she once had someone leave in the middle of the night. They told her they couldn’t sleep, because something was there with them. 

I was floored. I felt like I had been punched in the gut. Suddenly all the months I had spent feeling embarrassed and crazy became something else entirely. I told her how terrified I had been, how scared I was to come to work, and she apologized profusely, which I appreciated because honestly I was a little peeved she didn’t tell me before. She said that she hadn’t believed in any supernatural stuff until this guest house, and I couldn’t help but agree with her. She promised to deal with the problem. I didn’t know how she would do that, but wished her luck.

When I came back from backpacking 4 months later, Megan asked to meet with me.  I had been itching for an update about the guest house and I think she could sense that. She told me after I left, she called someone to come assess the situation. Honestly I still don’t know much about supernatural things so I don’t know the right “title” for what this lady was, but I guess she’s a well known spiritual woman in our town who people have gone to for this sort of stuff. I guess she went into the guest house, and immediately pointed to the vanity in the powder room. 

the powder room and the bathroom sit directly across from one another. I realized that when I cleaned the bathtub and felt that presence behind me, it was the vanity, which was the only thing within my eye-line each time I turned around. 

Megan told me she got the vanity at an estate sale, and it had been in the guest house since the venue first opened. She said that the lady told her it was the most powerful spiritual force she had ever worked with, and asked that Megan destroy the vanity immediately, which she did. She also later told Megan that the spirit followed her home and attacked her and tried to possess her but I’m only mentioning that briefly because A) Despite what I experienced I don’t really believe that lol and B) Megan didn’t tell me much about it 

Since the vanity was destroyed, Megan tells me that she hasn’t had any more issues/complaints with the guest house, but now she’s super into spiritual stuff which she wasn’t before. Before this happened to me, I would scoff at these kind of stories or explain them away, but nothing can ever explain the way I felt in that guest house. Now, whenever someone tells me or I read a creepy story, I pause before dismissing it and think about those times where my whole body was immobilized with fear which at the time, was seemingly no reason at all.

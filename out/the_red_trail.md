I don't know if you will see this but I pray that you do because just thirteen days ago I ventured into the Himalayan mountains for some stress relief as I started to make my way through the forest and all I decided to diverge from.

The path and I accidentally slipped on some leaves and hit my head I didn't know what to do so I decided to find a comfortable place to sit down I don't know what happened next but when i woke up I didn't. 

Know what to do I guess I had diverged to far from the path because I was literally in the middle of the forest and surrounded by nothing but trees I began to panic with my head rushing a million miles a minute.

I just jumped up and started to run deeper into the forest calling out to anyone hoping that someone would tell back but to no avail I now realize that was a stupid decision to make and I now regret it deeply.

Because if I had knew what was going to happen later on I would have ran the other way but I digress but after a few days in the forest I started to hear strange sounds almost like voices all around me like.

They were taunting me toying with my own mind trying to drive me crazy but I know I'm not don't ask me how I know I just know I've known from the very beginning that I didn't imagine any of it I know what I saw. 

After the fourth day passed I began to realize something I was lost not truly I just kept going in circles it was weird as if I knew what I was doing the whole time but why was the question I needed the answer for.

As I kept walking I began to wonder what if I walked straight so as I stopped walking I turned my body to the center of the circle and began to walk straight ahead almost as if I was being lead by somebody. 

And as I search deeper I began to realize that I am his sheep and david my shepherd I don't know why I was doing what I was doing my body was telling me to turn away but I just kept pushing forth as if it meant nothing to me.

As I kept walking through the thick trees and bushes filled with ivy I began to see light moving through the forest I entered a clearing and realized just what I was dealing with the scene before me could only be described in one word. 

Morbid I had never thought about what hell could have looked like but as I looked at what was what laid before my eyes I soon began to realize that this was hell I saw chaos and madness personified in what was happening in front of me.

And realized that the good merciful God I learned about would not even give this place a moment of his time no this place was the backyard of the devil himself purgatory truly it was horrific a place that would scar. 

Even the bravest of men it was a place that should be stricken form the earth and thrown into the depths of nothingness honestly and humbly I say to you all that should a man enter into this hell and come out the. 

Other side the he should be revered and worshipped as a king and a man among men for the sacrificial grounds that exist in front of me and lie beneath my eyes will fill you with true and honest fear. 

For what I saw was not to be taken lightly but as a threat to all that step within the confides of the red trail  I could describe it only as sickening and fearful for what was in front of me was disturbed to say the least as the ground might as well have been blood with how much had seeped into the earth beneath me. 

I looked on and horror to see body's strung up in trees like empty fleshy suits with their intense on the outside  I saw the dead bodies of women and children lead up and line a pathway up to the firepit I continued to look on in shock and anguish. 

As I bones surrounding the firepit as if meant to summon the devil himself I wanted to cry out but I couldn't and I wanted to scream to the heavens to save me from this nightmare but alas nothing came to the surface but a whimper and tears.

I reluctantly turned my body around only to gasp at the horror in front of my eyes I looked at the trees to see them all covered in claw marks as if to form a demonic painting I heard the cries of the forest as if to tell that my death was soon.

And I listened to the chirping from the birds as if they were trying to sing tunes from hell I don't know what came over me but I couldn't find my resolve to move I was frozen in terror unable to do anything when all of a sudden my body ran on its own. 

I began to run run for what felt like hours I felt the energy enter and leave my body as if it was a gift from the heavens themselves opened up to grant me strength after a little while I stopped running and checked my watch only to look in horror when I.

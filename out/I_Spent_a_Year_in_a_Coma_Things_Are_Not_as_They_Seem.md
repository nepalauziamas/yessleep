About a year and a half ago, I was in a terrible car accident that put me in a coma. Doctors say that I had so little brain activity that they thought I would never awaken. They said it was a miracle that I did, but that is a lie.

The year I spent in the coma was not as peaceful as one would expect from how little activity there was in my brain, rather it was a time I spent as a prisoner.

I lived out a life more horrifying than I could have imagined, in a world filled with creatures out of humanity’s worst nightmares. Even thinking of the things I remember from that time sends an icy chill down my spine. No matter how much it scares me to remember these things, I need to share what happened and warn the world of it.

Right after the accident happened, I bolted up in my bed, heart racing, and I thought the accident was just a bad dream. As I calmed down, I glanced over at the clock on my nightstand and saw that I was going to be late for work. I quickly showered and ate breakfast before rushing out to my car. It was then that I saw them.

I would try to describe the creatures I saw roaming the empty streets, but there will never be words that can do them justice. I froze when I saw them, thinking that I was still in a nightmare and tried to wake up, but I found that I couldn’t. It was then that one of the abominations saw me and charged. I hoped that I would wake up right before it reached me, but I didn’t. I felt claws ripping into my flesh and heard the sound of my limbs being torn off as I died.  


Then I woke up in my bed, heart racing before seeing that I was late for work.

As I rushed out to my car, I saw my head on the ground, face frozen in pain and terror. I tried to sprint back into my house, but I was caught before I had made it more than a couple feet. Once again, I felt myself die as the monsters ripped me apart.

Once again, I woke up, heart racing. I looked out the window, uncaring of the time, and saw the creatures still outside. I spent the next month hiding in my house before I ran out of food and starved to death.

The remainder of the year was spent in an endless cycle of dying and waking up. I tried as hard as I could to escape, but nothing helped.

One day when I was hiding in my house, I suddenly woke up to find myself in a hospital bed surrounded by doctors.

Some of you may be wondering why I am telling you my story after escaping the nightmare, but there are some things that just don’t line up, making me question if it was truly a nightmare and not reality.

First, the date on my watch in the nightmare matched the time when I both fell into the coma and when I woke up, correct to the minute.

Second, after I woke up, I began to see the creatures from my nightmare out of the corner of my eye.

Third, I still fall asleep and find myself in the same twisted version of reality that I spent a year. Sometimes I even wake up to find deep scars that weren’t there when I fell asleep.

And finally, the most convincing thing is that I am not the only one to experience this. I have spoken to others who described the nightmare perfectly and even saw the same things out of the corner of their eye. That could be passed off as our imaginations playing tricks on us, but it still doesn’t explain why we saw the exact same thing at the exact same time.

Combined, this makes me believe that what we lived through wasn’t just a dream, but rather another version of reality, one that we can never truly escape.

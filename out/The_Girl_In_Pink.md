When I was 14 something happened to me and my friend that we will never forget.

It was around evening and me and my friend (who we will call Michael) were sitting at the park bench just chatting and getting in touch about stuff, we talked about horror stories and video games.

It was pretty nice since we hadn't seen each other in weeks, so as we were talking we suddenly heard faint crying over the distance we both glanced at each other and didn't think much about it we kept talking and then realized the crying was getting closer and closer from behind us. We turned around and what we saw was a little girl in pink holding his hands in her face and she was crying and saying random words like "I Hate You! ". We were a bit confused because why would a little girl be outside in the evening alone?

As me and Michael were staring at the little girl thinking to ourselves about what to do the girl was already gone. After a moment of silence what felt like 10 min I turned to Michael and said:

Me: "Bro what was that about? "

Michael: "I don't know but should we go ask if she's lost? "

Me: "I Don't know if that's a good idea, to me that was really creepy."

Michael: "Bro we can't just leave a little girl go by herself in the dark! "

Me: "Ugh fine but if we die it's on you".

Then we stood up from the bench and took our bikes and then tried to catch up with the little girl.

After what felt like hours trying to search the park area Michael yelled to me.

Michael: "YO I THINK I FOUND HER! "

Me: "Hold on I'll be right there! "

I went over to Michael and he was next to a small forest he pointed down and we saw her, except something was off she didn't look the same when we saw her the first time. Her hair was falling off and her voice was deeper, it started to really creep me out and then Michael yelled.

Michael: "Hello are you okay?! "

Suddenly the girl looked at us and we saw it, she was smiling so widely it was inhuman and her hands were longer than before and she had fully black eyes.

Michael and I started to yell as the monster that we thought was a little girl started to grow longer and as she grew we could hear the loud popping of the girls bones as it grew larger and larger and then she started to scream so loudly that our ears almost popped. Me and Michael took our bikes and started pedaling as fast as we could and we could hear the loud steps of the monster behind us, after some time we couldn't hear the loud footsteps anymore and we were relieved, Michael and I were thinking about calling the police and then we thought that they might think were crazy, so we let it go and both of us went home.

Times passed and now I'm almost 17 and sometimes when me and Michael hangout we both still remember the day that we survived a monster.

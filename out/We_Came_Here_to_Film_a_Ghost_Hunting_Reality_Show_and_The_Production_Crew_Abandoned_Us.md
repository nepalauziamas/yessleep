I don't have a great connection, but I wanted to throw this story out into the aether and see if anyone could help me. It all started simply enough: Myself, my best friend Greg, and our mutual friend Nico have been hobby ghost hunters for years now. We have stuck mainly to areas close to where we all live in Arkansas: abandoned farmhouses, reportedly haunted bridges, and mysterious cemeteries. Recently, our YouTube channel has begun to get a boost in viewers. After being on a well-known countdown channel, people start piling in to see our escapades. We began to receive sponsorship deals, and Nico was even able to quit his job to seriously focus on the day-to-day of running our channel and socials. 

He became our kind of de-facto manager. He'd keep up on business emails; so it came as no surprise when he phoned me some time ago to talk about something interesting in our inbox. A production company based out of Italy -Tuffatore Productions- wanted to develop a TV show based around our ghost hunts. We met with the producers over Zoom and they laid out the deal they were offering: they would send us to haunted locations around the world, and we'd bring our backwoods charm to the proceedings, along with compelling footage of possible paranormal events. We were frankly over the moon about the possibility of travelling the world and doing what we loved. Maybe that's why we didn't look too closely at the deal. 

We scraped together a bit of cash and hired a contract lawyer and he explained that the contract was fairly standard and fair. He mentioned a strange clause about death, dismemberment, and disappearance, but we assumed since we'd be in abandoned buildings, that the production crew were just covering their asses. After getting the all clear from our lawyer we signed the contract and committed to an initial order of two episodes, which the production company would pitch to a bunch of different networks. I won't bore you with the contract specifics, but Nico, Greg, and I each received a handsome payment for our time, with a guaranteed amount if the show got picked up. Within a week of signing the contract, we were on a plane to Boston. From there, we took an extremely long boat ride to where we are now: Griffith's lighthouse. 

We disembarked with our camera gear and a week's worth of supplies. There was no crew. Just us for 7 days on this supposedly haunted little chunk of rock somewhere in the Atlantic. We were expected to be picked up on the morning of the 7th day, but that never happened. I'm entering what I think is my 17th day on the island, and I don't think anyone is coming for me. The first seven days were fine. We gathered footage, hung out, and spent way too much time talking about how rich we were going to be once the show got picked up. We got some okay EVP and a wind gust slamming the door to the lighthouse will probably be used to promote the show for years to come. Greg said it was a moment that should be forever enshrined in the opening credits. On the morning of the 7th day when our boat didn't come, we weren't too worried. It looked like a storm was coming in, and we assumed no one would try to travel in it. We dragged our stuff back inside determined to wait it out. 

That night, while the storm raged outside, the door to the lighthouse slammed open again while we sat not 10 feet from it, playing cards. I hopped up to shut it, and in a flash of lightning I swear I saw someone outside. They were just standing at the top of the steps that led down to the docks, and they were waving. I told Nico and Greg and they blew it off as imagination. We'd been in this creepy place for a week, and it was getting easier to psych ourselves out. Greg was next to see our strange visitor. It was day 9 or 10, and he had walked down to the dock to see if he could see any boats that he could maybe signal. He came rushing back into the lighthouse pale and panting. He swore that he had looked down into the water and seen a man on his back, just under the surface of the water. Waving. He said the man was clearly dead, as his body was bloated, and his skin was stretching and tearing, revealing black seams of rot. 

The next day, Nico went missing. 

At this point we did a full search of the island. It wasn't difficult, as it's just a lighthouse on a rock outcrop. You could see the whole island from the top of the lighthouse. During our search I found something that guarantees I'm never leaving this place. I almost didn't notice it at first. I was wandering the island, shouting for Nico, when my foot caught on something, sending me sprawling to the ground. When I finally got myself up, I saw that it was a chain. I grabbed at it, intending to pull it out of the ground. Instead, it lifted up a door buried in the wet earth. As the door lifted, my nose was assaulted by the god awful stench of decay. There was a small set of metal steps leading down, and, having no concern for my own safety, I trudged down. 

At the bottom of the stairs there was a chamber, maybe about 50 feet long, 50 feet wide. Up against the back wall there were boxes. Boxes just like the ones we had brought our gear in. Surrounding the boxes were bodies. A great heap of bodies. I covered my nose and got closer. The bodies were a scatter shot of different rates of decay. Some looked fairly fresh, while others were almost skeletons. I started noticing some of them were wearing tshirts emblazoned with different ghost hunting teams. A body of a woman no more than 25 years old was wearing a "Ghost Getters" shirt, a man near her was wearing one with "C.I.G.S, Central Indiana Ghost Society" patches. The more I looked the more ghost hunting teams I found. 

I heard shuffling behind me, and ran to the stairs to catch Greg before he came down. I looked up and instead of Greg, saw a waterlogged corpse staring at me, holding the corner of the trap door covering the hatch. He gave a little wave and slammed it shut. I rushed up, expecting to be locked in this place forever, like the bodies decomposing all around me, but the trap door freely gave way and I burst into the grey sunlight of the island. 2 days ago, while I was sitting on the dock trying to catch fish with a small bit of fishing line and a hook Nico had squirreled away in his suitcase, I heard what sounded like a scream starting before immediately being cut off. I ran to the top of the stairs and saw Greg standing at the railing around the lighthouse. He was halfheartedly waving, so I waved back and headed back to the dock to see if I could catch some food. 

When I returned a few hours later, I saw that Greg was still standing exactly where he had been before, still waving in that strange, halfhearted way. As I got closer, I realized why: Greg was dead. His throat was slashed from ear to ear, but there was no blood. He had been roughly lashed to the railing with old rope, with his right arm left free to dangle in the wind. I didn't even bother untying him. I just ran. I ran for the trap door, threw it open, and barreled down into this tomb. I've been here two days by my reckoning. I searched the gear boxes and found this phone. I also found camera gear dating back to what I think is the 60's. In the last two days, I've heard sounds up top. Wrenching, grinding sounds, laughing, banging, and a low gurgling that keeps happening right outside the door of the hatch. I've braced a tripod on either side of the door, and I'll leave it that way. 

Today I heard a new sound. It sounds like a boat engine, and it's getting closer and closer every hour. I'm at Griffith's Lighthouse, in the Atlantic Ocean, and although my friends are surely dead, I am not alone.

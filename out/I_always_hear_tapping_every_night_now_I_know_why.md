A year ago I had just arrived home from a long day of shopping for school clothes, I ran to my room and plopped myself on my bed. 

I decided to change into my pjs like any normal person would do before they slept! I grabbed my pjs and started changing meanwhile I had the blinds open and curtain open too. I began to tear of my clothes and then I felt a pare of eyes stare at me. I assumed it was my paranoia but I still went to the bathroom to change.

After I was done I jumped on my bed and began texting my friend to let her know I was home. Then the same feeling came back, I turned towards the window and I heard a noise coming from it. Tap Tap Tap. I jumped down from my bed to close the blinds and curtain but then I saw it. I screamed “SHIT!” As then my mom ran in. 

“WHATS WRONG CARLY?” 

“SOMEONES AT MY WINDOW!”

“WHAT.” 

I nodded as my mom bolted to my closet and grabbed a box, she opened it with haste and handed a pistol over to me. I was shaking and my mom looked me dead in the eye and said, “RUN.”

I of course listened to her and grabbed my phone and my shoes and bolted out the house, my dad had his gun which I had no idea what sort of gun it was. 

I ran towards my car and locked it and realized I left the keys inside. I ran back in to see my mom and dad in shock and my dad spoke.

“What did it look like, Carly.”

“It was tall..long hair, and it looked like a animal but it wasnt..” I said as tear fell down my face and fumbling my words. 

They looked at each other and spoke.

“Pack a bag quickly.” 

I listened as I packed and grabbed my keys, I waved to my parents as I drove to my friends house, I stayed their for a week then came back home.

Every week I would hear the tapping. It was the same eerie tapping every week but fast forward to yesterday 10:37pm I laid in my bed watching netflix and my window was open 

The tapping stopped for two weeks so I thought I was safe! I paused the tv and walked to the bathroom to pee.
The awkward steps to the bathroom will haunt me for the rest of my life because that would me the last time I was normal.

I walked back to my room and closed the window as I laid back down. I closed my eyes as I heard a door creak open. I peaked open my eyes as  I saw the closet door peep open. My stomach twisted as I remembered I cut the screen on my window so I can sneak in and out.

I realized my gun was in the closet too, I remained laying there in my bed as I saw a tall man step out of my closet and then I remembered my uncle lived next door and he looked exactly like that.

There basically is no end, It is currently 10:46 AM and the closet door is cracked open and my parents are most likely dead. I hear groaning in the closet currently and it sounds 
like someone in pain. I don’t know what to do and I cant call the cops because they are 1hr away.


THE END

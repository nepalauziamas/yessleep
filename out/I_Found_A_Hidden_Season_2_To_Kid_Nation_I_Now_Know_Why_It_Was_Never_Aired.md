"40 kids, no rules, what could go wrong?" I thought, pressing play on the TV remote on the first episode of Kid Nation. The show promptly starts with the entrance of a school bus. The narrator tells the audience,

"On the bus are 40 kids, ranging in age from 8 to 15. They come from all over the United States, each with their own story. Some are rich, some are poor, and some just don't want to be there."

The kids disembark the bus and are met by the show's host, Jonathon Karsh. He tells them that they will be spending the next 40 days in Bonanza City, a town that was abandoned after a gold rush. The town has no electricity, no running water, and no rules. The kids will have to work together to create their own government and society. 

The first few hours are spent exploring the town and getting to know each other. The kids quickly realize that they will have to work together if they want to eat dinner. They start setting up camp in an old-looking shack and begin to explore ways to feed all 40 kids with just spaghetti. They soon discover that there is a small stream running through the town... Wait I don't remember this. I paused the show. It displayed 15 minutes and 48 seconds had passed. "What the hell..?" I asked myself, unsure whether this was something I had forgotten from the last time I watched it. See, when the show came out in 2008, I was a huge reality-tv junkie and wanted my hands on every show that involved some sort of survival complex in it. This was the gold for me because after the 13th episode, I signed up immediately for the second season. Due to the controversy the show got however, no season 2 was made. 

I clicked off full screen and checked the url. I am streaming it in 480p resolution in a backwoods streaming site called "Vimeo" because yeah, I am the lucky bastard who found a vimeo 12 pages down in the Google page results looking for a free Kid Nation. I looked at the title below the video and it read: "kid.nation.2.41110ep1.mp4" with no description. Under closer evaluation, I noticed the seemingless isolated '2' infront of nation. "Kid Nation 2? No... There's no way." I pressed play on the video player and went back into full screen.

"Hey Bonanza City, where is the town council?" Jonathon asks,

A kid wearing a blue bandana and what looked to be a red flannel shirt walks on camera from behind one of the buildings, "I haven't seen them. Have you guys seen them?" The other kids start to gather around, all with the same look of confusion.

"No, we haven't seen them since this morning."

"Let's go find them!"

The kids start to search the town for the town council. They search every building and every nook and cranny but they can't find them anywhere. The police arrive on the scene and start questioning the kids. They ask if anyone has seen anything suspicious or out of the ordinary. 

 One of the girls, a shy 10-year-old named Sarah, comes forward and tells the police that she saw a man in a black hoodie walking around near the edge of town late last night. The police thank her for her information and tell the kids to go back to theircampsite.

The kids are visibly shaken by the events of the day. They huddle around the campfire and try to make sense of what is going on. Sarah tells the group what she saw and they all start to speculate about who the man in the hoodie could be. 

"Maybe he's just a wanderer," says one of the boys.

"Or maybe he's a murderer!" says another.

The group is quickly divided on what to do. Some want to stay and search for the town council, while others want to leave and find help. In the end, they decide to stay and search for the council until morning. 

As night falls, the kids take turns keeping watch. Sarah is on watch when she sees something moving in the bushes near the edge of camp. She wakes up one of the boys and they go to investigate. A wild boy,

bloody and covered in scratches, comes out of the bushes. The kids are shocked and scared. They don't know what to do.

The wild boy is taken back to camp where the kids try to feed and care for him. They soon realize that he is feral and doesn't know how to speak or communicate. The only thing he knows how to do is fight. The kids start to get scared of him and some even want to get rid of him. In the end, they decide to keep him around and try to help him learn how to be a part of their community.

"RUN!"

Sarah screamed as the wild boy came out of the bushes, blood dripping down his face, with a crazed look in his eyes. The other kids didn't know what to do, they were frozen in fear. Sarah turned and sprinted towards camp, the wild boy close behind her. 

She could hear his heavy breathing and feel his hot breath on the back of her neck. She was about to reach the camp when she felt a sharp pain in her leg and she went down. The wild boy was on top of her in an instant, tearing at her clothes with his teeth. She screamed and kicked at him, trying to fight him off, but he was too strong. He grabbed her throat and started to choke her. She could see the look of hunger in his eyes and she knew she was going to die. 

The other kids finally snapped out of their trance and ran towards Sarah and the wild boy. They tackled him off of her and held him down. One of the boys punched him in the face and he finally stopped fighting. They tied him up with some rope and dragged him back to camp.

Sarah was badly injured and covered in blood. The kids did their best to clean her up and bandage her wounds, but they knew she wouldn't be able to walk. They decided to carry her back to town on a make-shift stretcher. As they started walking, Sarah kept thinking about the wild boy and what could have happened if the other kids hadn't come when they did.

The next morning, The kids make their way back to town. Once they arrive, they see that the school bus is parked in front of the town hall, where the town council is supposed to be. The kids rush inside and see the town council gathered around a table in the center of the room. They were all laid out on the table, gagged and bound. The kids take them off and begin to ask them what the hell happened. After they untied them and they regained their voices.

The council members told the kids that a group of men had come into town the day before and taken over. They said they were looking for children to take with them. The council had tried to fight back, but they were outnumbered and outgunned. The men had taken some of the council members as hostages and demanded that the town hand over all the children, or they would kill the hostages.

A violent fight broke out in the middle of town. The kids stood no match as the cameraman hid behind a bush. He was no other than Jonathon, who was watching this like it was entertainment. I thought to myself: is this all staged? Is this a film project? I continued watching and the episode went on.

The kids were brutally beaten as Jonathon laughed at them. He approached a young boy, only eleven years old, and kicked him where he was injured. He begged Jonathon to stop but he continued. The boy lay there, screeching in pain as Jonathon stood over him, laughing and saying "This is reality, if you can't take it, you shouldn't have played this game."

One of the kids tried to attack Jonathon but he was immediately shot. The kids and their beloved 'teacher' were horrified. They couldn't believe what was happening. 

Jonathon smirked and said, "I'll be back for the rest of you dirty, filthy animals later." He got into the bus and drove away with the hostages. The kids were trapped and unable to do anything. They were helpless. They were all alone. 

The episode ended and the video stopped. I immediately went to my computer and looked up Jonathon. I found his twitter and his instagram. They were filled with pictures of him and his 'Kid Nation' coworkers, posing with children and smiling. I closed the pages and threw up a little. I was disgusted, enraged and scared.

I immediately went to the CBS website, hoping to find more information about the show. I clicked on their about page and looked for a place for their contact information. It was nowhere to be found. The only link was their social media pages. I closed that page and got out of my chair. I started to walk around my room, trying to make sense of what I had just seen. I was thinking maybe it was all a purposely bad acting job and it wasn't really real. I opened my computer and went back to CBS's social media pages. I left a comment on their Instagram asking if what I saw was real. I got one confirmation:

"Yes, it was real." - Johnny :)

 **Ever** since I was young I've worked odd jobs, you know painting a house here, or fixing up a car there and what not. Well a couple of days ago one of my **old** clients called me up asking to move some heavy boxes out of the basement and take them to the local garbage disposal company, I'm not one to question requests, I do them to make it pays the bills. When I pulled up to the house I could smell a **putrid odor** wafting at me even with the car windows up, that was the first sign that I'd bitten off more than I could chew with this one but nevertheless I got out of my car and walked in. It'd been a

 while since I'd seen this client, And he seemed **so... off..** he was very anxious about where I went in the house and would only let me come a few steps past the door. He showed me the basement and all of the **MANY** heavy boxes that needed to be moved, It smelled like something had died down there but what caught my attention the most was a door with **3 heavy locks attached to it**. I jokingly asked my client what was behind the door and he got very defensive telling me to mind my buisness and do my job and thats when he **stormed** up the stairs angrily, I shrugged it off and continuted to move heavy box after heavy box into my truck. After about half an hour I was nearly done when I noticed something.. a box in the corner was leaking something, something red. I walked closer to the box and seeing it that close with my own 2 eyes, there was no denying it, This was **blood**. I nearly threw up but what bought me back was the feint sound of knocking. **\*bang\* bang\* bang\*** Something was coming from the door but I had no clue what it could possibly be, but I was undeniably sure that the room behind that door had been sound proofed so that whatever sound came from that room **never escaped**. It wasn't done well enough though as I heard another sound escape from inbetween the cracks in the door, if I had to make it out I would say it sounded like the word "**help**." I shrugged it off

 as I went on and carried the final few boxes to my truck then went inside to let my neighbor know that the job had been done. When I approached the kitchen I saw him standing there with a **knife**, chopping something up but he quickly blocked my view of whatever it was and brought me back outside to pay me. He handed me the money and as I walked off I noticed that the bills he handed me were covered in a red liquid, **blood**. While I was driving off I heard a box fall out of the back of my truck. When I went to go put it back up the box had been opened and what was inside left me lost for words, There was a backpack, some clothes, bricks and a **student id of a child that had gone missing** about a **week** earlier.I got back in my truck and drove off quicker than I ever have before I immediatly dropped off the boxes at the disposal as I was told and went home. He's sent about **100 call's** since then begging me to do a night gig, Ive never answered him back but I get the feeling I'll be seeing him **very** soon again regardless.

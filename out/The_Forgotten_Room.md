Father once told me in one of our rare familial moments of sincerity that the men he sentenced to die were even lower than the filthiest disease-ridden vermin, and that by punishing them so severely he was performing a divine service. One not simply in honour of the Lord and the Crown, but the people whom we occupied and subjected to such barbarities in the first place by showing so bluntly the power of the King’s might over his ever-growing dominion. It is my opinion that he indeed genuinely did believe such things with all his heart, which surely is a testament to how he was able to find restful slumber in the night as the wails of the damned permeated the castle walls.


It is with this testimony of which I give according to nothing more than my own free will and insurmountable and eternal guilt that I hope to depose my father’s stellar reputation amongst the populace, that I may bring forth into the light and make known the horrendous truth of his deeds to the fullest possible extent so that the people will know that they do not revere a hero of war and battle, but a callous monster most vile and wretched. My sworn mission throughout the remainder of my life shall be to purge the contrived collective memory that has been constructed around my father following his death some six years ago. This is my confession, as both a still patriotic subject of the Crown and as a remorseful human being. My soul cannot find respite under the weight of such burden.


Throughout my childhood years spent in the castle living under my father’s care, I can recall that a tremendous effort was made to keep me firmly away from the carnage of the orders given during those dark times. Whether this was done out of some obscure paternal love which I never truly saw or if it was simply to assuage the doubts possibly simmering deeply in the background of his own fanaticism I shall never know, but I was consistently and relentlessly refused from venturing too far into certain areas of the property. In fact, the very presence of the dungeon complex escaped my naive perception until I was already a man of fifteen years. At which point, owing to the tempestuous resolve of young rebellion, I found myself sneaking beyond my father’s ever present grasp as night fell and the guards became less vigilant.


The excursions were only slight at first. I would make trips to the pantry where I would prepare my own food - a joy which I maintain to this day - or I would venture into the courtyard to gaze at the stars above and marvel at the complexities of the infinite. It was there, looking upwards into the twinkling beauty, that I first began to unravel the frightful revelation that would kill that sense of wonder within me forevermore. I would hear the muffled groans. The wailing. The screams. They were often sporadic, but utterly undeniable, and so wildly apparent in their suffering. So, I stopped making trips to the courtyard entirely, unable to stomach the frightening calls for mercy. At first, and it does embarrass me so to make my naivety known in such a public way as this, I thought perhaps the castle may be inhabited by a number of restless spirits.


I shall never forget my father’s response when I brought those concerns to him in childish earnestness. He bellowed, laughing and without the slightest remorse, that those 'old ghosts' weren’t in a position to harm the living in any way. ‘They are to be forgotten, like any other refuse.’ It became clear that the answers I was in search of would not come from the mouths of father nor his sycophantic entourage, and so I foolishly set out to uncover the source of those distressing sounds on my own, an endeavor of which - shamefully, I might add - I often find myself regretful of as I lay awake. Had I never seen such atrocities being carried out firsthand, had I simply been informed of them as my father was without the sight of the true unignorable brutality laid bare, perhaps I would even be in my father’s place today luxuriating in the flimsily justified carnage being wrought on our northern neighbors still, just as he was for all those terrible years. Ignorance, I find, can be and often is a blissful experience. Especially for one in a position of unyielding power. 


In the glow of an imposing full moon, I began my descent into the bowels of a hell constructed of grimy stone and iron bars, and with each step, the cries became all the more real. At the bottom of the stairs, a long corridor met my shuddering acquaintance, one with doorways of splintering wood on both sides, culminating in a single darkened chamber at its end which lay open. My footsteps seemed to carry into forever, echoing over the sobs of the broken on either side as I struggled with my nerves after reaching each closed doorway. In my fright, the will to face what lay on the other side of them became ever weakened until I had found myself at the very end, peering into the darkness of the only chamber left open. Silence seemed to inhabit the small space quite unlike all the others which were so clearly home to abject suffering. With a shaking hand I pulled a still-glowing lantern from its rusty hook and paced ever so tentatively inside where I was met by a wooden hatch placed upon the center of the floor. A whimper escaped my lips as I gripped the heavy iron handle with my free hand and slowly pulled upwards until what lay beneath became undeniably clear.


A mass of pale lacerated and bruised flesh, arms writhing languidly, a head, even a foot poked up above the rest crammed inside the cramped passage leading straight down into God knows where. The toes on the foot curled, the sight of which filled me with such unimaginable horror that I was unable to maintain what little composure remained within me. My startled screaming provoked those jammed inside, rousing them into fits of wails which became pleas for death. The man whose head was at the surface craned his neck to face me before recoiling from the brightness of the lantern clutched ever tightly to my chest. Finally, after what seemed like a millennia of terror, I fled like a coward back to the safety of my bedchamber where I found not rest but near-madness. The following morning, as the sun began to rise, I raided the pantry for some meager supplies and appropriated a horse from the stables. Then, I abandoned my duties and began my journey to the shores of France, where I still reside to this day.


I shall never forget the look on the face of the man trapped in that hellish abyss. His eyes haunt me, now and forever. They were the eyes of the damned, forgotten and cursed beyond any punishment that could ever be deemed appropriate by a civil society. When I think back to those innocent years, before the hidden barbarity of my family and countrymen became so painfully apparent to me, I can find no pleasure even in those happy memories. They are soiled. Drenched in blood. While I ate plentifully and slept soundly and learned from my mentors with such youthful enthusiasm, below my feet at any given time scores of men and women alike were being subjected to tortures not even befitting any possible conception of the underworld.


It is in this that I know that when death comes for me as it did my father, there is only one place fit for a complicit coward such as myself. That place is below. Deep below, where the sun does not ever shine and the air is fetid and damp and filled with anguish. Although I pray night and day for forgiveness, I expect none. I accept my fate.

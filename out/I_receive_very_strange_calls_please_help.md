Hello. I am trying to figure out what's happening. Basically a number from my saved contacts called me at 2:34 AM. I answered and I could hear myself through the phone, then the caller muted. It was weird, it was this girl I didn't talk with for a long time. I hang up the call and messaged her about it, mentioning the fact that I hang up in case it was a mistake. Then, few mins later, I get another call from another number in my contact list, it was an old friend. It was a beep, only for 1 second, and I didn't have time to answer it.

\*Both of these contacts are related to an old friend group I had, which I left because it was too toxic. thought I should mention this before continuing.\*

I messaged the 2nd number too, on Whatsapp, and I got the response "What do you mean? I  was sleeping". I thought for sure they're trying to prank me or something. Then the 1st number messaged me too saying "What?". They showed me the call logs and they were pretty serious about the fact that they didn't call me.

At this point I was very very confused, but in my mind I said "Ok, I'll just act like this didn't happen"

Then, after 20 minutes (more ore less), I get a call from the 2nd number again. It started to be very weird. I answered and stayed on mute, but for some reason I didn't think about recording the call.

In the call, it was the real voice of the 2nd guy, swearing at me and saying bad stuff, asked me where I am and that he wants to kill me, asked me to come to his house to fight. I was freaking out, so I asked "What the f\*ck is wrong with you?" and the call suddenly ended. I Spam-messaged this guy because I was confused af, he didn't seem like he had something with me when we talked earlier through messages.

I call him on Whatsapp and he tells me he didn't call me, and because the situation was already pretty weird before this (because since I left the group we stopped being friends anymore), he might've thought I am actually doing something weird so he was acting pretty indifferently. At that point it hit me. What he said in that call was actually a recording from a month ago when he had a fight with a guy. I asked him "Did you say (what he said) to that guy when you had a fight with him?" and he said "Probably yes, why?"

I realized someone was using his voice recording and spoofed his Caller ID to impersonate him. So it must be someone from my old friend group, right?

Well, I didn't think anyone is good enough with modern tech from that group to do this, and I have no idea who may be. Most of them are extroverted and don't use computers too often. Also how the hell did they do it? I read some articles and it's something about spoofing the Caller ID, but how?

I also have no idea if it's them, should I be worried? What can I do to fix this, I can't just block every number. I am getting paranoid.

How can I solve this? Should I call my phone credit provider? (idk how u call it in America). It's all pretty weird to me, it's the first time this happened to me, and I'm pretty used to computers and tech but I have no idea how they did this. I am getting paranoid. Please help.

EDIT: The Caller ID Shows exactly like they would call me. Their saved contact name and phone number.  [https://imgur.com/LmhR4sf](https://imgur.com/LmhR4sf) (hid their number and some text that shows where I am from, I'm too paranoid rn to give any information in public)

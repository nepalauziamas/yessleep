The last thing I remember before they kidnapped me, is sipping a vodka tonic at a bar in Romania. After that is blackness, followed immediately by blinding light.

I found myself sitting in a metal chair, inside of a metal room with one door. I would find out later that this place is called holding room 315.

It was very difficult to keep track of time but I'd guess that my first stay in the holding room lasted about 24 hours. At least from the moment that I became conscious.

My fear kept me patient at first but I slowly grew more and more frustrated, eventually resorting to yelling and beating on the door, demanding that they let me out. I would come to regret those words.

After all of my threats and demands, the door suddenly slid open with a hissing pneumatic sound. A cold automated voice came from flush-mounted speakers that were installed in the ceiling throughout the facility.

"Proceed to Cell 009 and enter the first chamber. Failure to comply will result in faculty confrontation."

I would come to call that voice Cynthia, after my ex-girlfriend. They were both cold and seemed to want me dead. I hope I never have to hear either one of them again.

After a few wrong turns, I eventually found my way to Cell 009. The door was open and the first chamber looked identical to my holding cell with the exception that it had a second door on the other side of the room.

I stepped into the first chamber and the door slid shut behind me. A moment later the interior door opened with that same pneumatic hiss. The second room was pitch black but something was stirring in the darkness. I was beginning to regret that I didn't opt for the faculty confrontation.

Sharp and precise footsteps approached the first chamber as panic spread through my body like a fever.

A white hand reached through the doorway and grasped the frame, something black and flowing trailed behind it.

My heart hung in my throat as an old man in priestly garments walked into the room.

He didn't even acknowledge me at first, rather he stood and stretched as if he hadn't moved in weeks. He then dusted off his sleeves and adjusted his clerical collar.

After bringing his attire back to acceptable conditions he then acknowledged my existence.

He smiled and motioned towards a metal chair up against the wall.

"Please have a seat and relax, you look as if you've seen a ghost. " He said with a heavy Italian accent.

"Umm ok. " I said as I took a seat.

"So what is this place? Why are we here?" I asked

The priest looked at me with arctic blue eyes and replied with a comforting voice.

"This place is a prison for some and a laboratory for others."

"So I guess we're the prisoners then?" I said

The priest made his way over to me and kneeled at my side.

"It is a prison for me, for you it's something else entirely... you are a very lucky young man. Very lucky that you were sent to my cell and not any of the others."

"What's in the other cells?" I asked

"Things from the edge of the earth, Living Nightmares." His gaze was intensely focused on me now.

"Are you saying they would have sent me to my death?"

"I'm saying it would have been a far worse death. " at this, the old man rolled his mouth back revealing long white fangs that struck at my neck like a hungry cobra.

I was frozen with fear but even if I was ready for the attack I wouldn't have had the speed or the strength to counter. The power and quickness of a vampire are just too much for an ordinary guy like me. In an instant I could feel my consciousness fading, there was nothing I could do but try to hold on.

But right before I slipped away, the old priest recoiled in horror. He stood and stumbled away from me clutching at his throat. He was barely able to squeak out one word, "impossible", before collapsing to the floor, dead...

Everything was silent for a moment before Cynthia chimed in, no doubt disappointed at my survival.

"Return to holding cell 315 and wait for further instruction"

The secondary door opened and I walked back into the hallway holding my head in my hands.

It would be, by my estimation, 2 days, before I'd receive my next set of instructions. I don't think they knew what to do with me after the incident with the vampire priest.

Back in my holding cell I sat in silence and tried to comprehend what had just happened to me. The best guess I had as to why the vampire had died was that he was severely allergic to my blood type. The absurdity of it made me laugh but I was still uneasy. I couldn't help but wonder what other creatures might be stored down here.

Some hours later, Cynthia returned.

"Proceed to cell 014 and enter the first chamber. Failure to comply will result in faculty confrontation."

I'd decided non-compliance was my best option. As it turns out, it was not. I stubbornly remained in my chair, and a few minutes later, two guards showed up dressed in full swat gear, minus the acronym. They proceeded to beat the daylights out of me until I said that I would comply. I'm pretty sure they broke several of my ribs and my nose was gushing blood.

My hope of surviving this place was hanging by a thread, as I shuffled down the hallways towards cell 014. When I found the room and peered inside the open door, that last thread of hope disintegrated in a flame of despair.

Every surface, including the floor and the ceiling, was covered with blood stains and dents. I imagined a thousand rabid Pitbull's tearing people to shreds and throwing body parts in every direction.

"Way to think positive Stan", I told myself

I considered another "faculty confrontation", but I didn't think I could handle another beating from the guards. Reluctantly I entered the room and the door closed behind me sealing my fate.

My feet were welded to the ground with anticipatory suspense and time stood still as my eyes were transfixed by the secondary door.

An electrical shocking sound came from the secondary chamber and a nerve-melting, high-pitched scream filled the room. Then the hammering started. It sounded as if someone had shocked the Tasmanian devil with a cattle prod. It picked up speed like a tornado made of rocks and metal, bouncing off the walls, and threatening to tear the whole facility down. Then the door opened.

Black fur and sharp angles burst into the room. Whatever it was had so much speed that I couldn't get a good look at it. It jumped off the floor and hit the wall with heavy feet, as it churned its legs like a spider on steroids. Around and around it went, threatening to take my head off with what looked like antlers, all the while screaming bloody murder.

It turned its demonic head in my direction and was on me in a flash. It knocked me on my back and pinned me with its antlers.

I was face to face with pure evil. Mere inches away from a wendigo.

It snarled and leaned closer with blood dripping from its broken teeth. Black eyes were set deep within a half skeletal half rotten face and its stare burned into me. But I didn't look away, I looked back into its crow-like eyes, and prepared to meet my end. That's when I noticed the shift.

A softening flush spread over its' gaze and then, leaning even closer, it started licking my cheek.

"Umm ok, buddy that's enough," I said hesitantly. "You've got to let me up now"

I had been reflexively holding onto its antlers trying to keep it off of me so as it backed away and lifted its gangly head, it pulled me to my feet.

The creature then moved closer and bowed its head down, nuzzling my chest.

"Thanks, Wendi, I hope you don't mind if I call you that".

It almost purred in approval.

I started scratching behind its antlers in a particularly knotted patch of fur and I couldn't help but chuckle as its back leg started kicking like a dog.

Now that the stress had evaporated from the situation I started looking around the room. That's when I spotted a small camera above the door I had entered.

I waved at it with one hand as I gave Wendi pets with the other.

"Ok guys I know you can hear me, this was scary and all but I think I'm gonna go back to my room now. "

I motioned for Wendi to go back to the secondary chamber and he/she happily trotted in and sat down.

"Ok Wendi, you be good I'll be back later. "

And at that, the secondary door closed and the one leading to the hallway opened.

Yet again I didn't know what to make of what had happened.

Without any explanation, this pattern continued for the next 8 days.

Every day I'd get my instructions to go to a new cell and every day I'd either accidentally kill or make friends with a new monster.

I played fetch with the Wolfman using my shoe, a zombie took a bite out of my shoulder and immediately keeled over like it had eaten a cyanide steak, I swam around with some grotesque version of a mermaid, and I had a nice conversation with bigfoot, FYI he mostly speaks in a rudimentary sign language.

After ten "experiments" the two guards returned. The only thing they said was "follow us" so I complied, I did not want a repeat of last time.

They took me to a part of the facility I'd never seen before. We made our way down a labyrinth of hallways before reaching an elevator door. One of the guards scanned his iris and the doors opened. He then punched the button for the 40th floor. Once the doors reopened they took me to a conference room where a grizzled tired looking man in a suit sat at the end of the table.

I sat down across from him and he looked at me with a faint smile as he opened the folder in front of him.

"Stan Sing, I imagine you've got a lot of questions," he said.

"Yea I do... like why did you kidnap me and throw me in a monster prison just to see if I could survive?!"

"Hold on a minute, let me give you the rundown first, then you can ask all the questions you want. First of all, you need to understand that this was the only way we could be sure that you were who we thought you were. We've been watching you and we believed that you had certain hereditary abilities that we need in our service. The thing is these abilities can skip generations. We had to be sure you were the real McCoy... Did you know, Stan, that your ancestors changed their last name when they moved to America?"

"No, I didn't know that," I said

"Your family's last name used to have 3 more letters. H-e-l."

"You can't be serious..."

"I'm serious as a heart attack, and you're here because we need your help, Stan Helsing. A new threat has emerged from the dark fog of ancient history and we think you are the only one who can stop it. "

"Uhh ok, whatever you say."

"So will you help us?" The man asked

"Sure, why not".

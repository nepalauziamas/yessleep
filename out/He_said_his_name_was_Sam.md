My wife and I had been living in our ancient Victorian house for nearly five years before we found it. Something stank in the subfloor in the upstairs den and I spent one quiet Saturday in September prying up the plywood in hopes of discovering a dead rodent.

The room was on our renovation list anyway. The maple flooring was beyond restoration, having taken some water damage when the house was abandoned in the eighties.

The floorboards were stained black like long, rotted teeth and the wood was spongy the further I sank the prybar in.

“Ugh,” I recoiled as the smell worsened. “Caroline,” I hollered out to the door. “Can you grab me an N-95, please?”

I picked up my DeWalt and deftly unscrewed the first section of subfloor. The subfloor had been replaced not too long ago, I noticed. The house was built in the late 1800’s but the plywood boards still had a fresh, blond color to them.

I heard Caroline clapping up the stairs as I wrestled the wood from the floor.

The patchwork of plywood was all I could see while I held the giant sheet in front of me. I set it down gently just as Caroline came in the doorway. She extended a hand with a mask pinched in her fingers.

“Thanks, love,” I took it from her but noticed she was frowning past me at the floor. I turned around. There was a loud knock from under another part of the subfloor, but for all I knew it was the wood settling after I’d had at it with the prybar.

Besides, I was instantly distracted. I followed Caroline’s gaze and there it was. Set in the subfloor under the plywood I had moved was an old black safe with silver stenciling.

“Oh, shit!” I shuffled on my knees over to it. “Oh god, I’ve always wanted this to happen.” I swiped the dust from it.

Caroline crouched next to me and smiled. “Really? You’ve always wanted to haul a heavy safe down our steep staircase? You’re so sweet.”

I rolled my eyes. “Come on. Look how old this thing is. I’m not saying it’s filled with gold. But it could hold history.”

“It’s empty,” she said plainly.

“How do you know?”

“Because they always are. People don’t forget about safes when they move, they just don’t want to move them.”

“Don’t listen to her,” I spoke to the safe. “You’re filled with treasures.”

“Mhmm. Mundane documents, if anything.”

“Twenty bucks there’s something interesting inside.”

“Twenty bucks there’s nothing at all.”

Caroline extended her hand, and we shook on it.

“Easiest twenty bucks I’ve ever made,” I said and patted the side of the safe.

While the thing wasn’t much bigger than a microwave it weighed at least a hundred unwieldy pounds.

Caroline’s first instinct of considering the difficulty of moving this thing was spot on. Getting it down the stairs alone would be downright dangerous. I thought I’d try to crack it open where it sat. That way if there was something of value inside, I could secure its contents before pushing the safe itself out the window into the weed bed below.

I really didn’t want to carry that thing down the stairs.

Finding the safe was reason enough to stop my weekend labor and I decided to call it a day. Unfortunately, my safecracking plan fell apart after an hour of YouTube. The best course of action for an amateur like me was to cut the back out with a saw, but the empty den was a tinder box. One hot bit of metal sinking into the subfloor could burn the whole house down.

When Caroline was busy watching TV that night, I opened the den window, hoped there was no priceless china inside, and heaved the thing out.

It thumped into dirt. I leaned out the window to look after it. A part of me was hoping it would be hanging open and that the fall would break the old thing. But it sat still like a meteorite in the earth.

I walked downstairs. Caroline looked over her shoulder from the couch. “Want a hand with that thing?”

“No need. I already brought it down.”

She paused her show. “Really?”

“Yeah, didn’t you hear me huffing and puffing twenty minutes ago?” I rubbed my hands together.

“You threw it out the window, didn’t you?”

I shrugged with a smile.

“It didn’t hit the house on the way down?”

“Course not, I plotted it’s possible trajectory.”

“Ah huh.” She stood up and followed me out the back door.

We stood over the safe like proud parents. Perhaps the pride was mine more than hers.

“When are you going to try to open it?” Caroline asked.

“I’ll pick up a metal blade for the circular saw tomorrow.”

“We’re having my parents over for dinner tomorrow.”

“It’s not going to take all day. Few hours, tops.”

“Tops.” She repeated skeptically and smiled at me knowing how I got obsessed with projects.

“You can run the saw.”

“I know I can run the saw, Michael. It’s *my* saw.”

“Right.”

She smiled and started heading back inside. She paused in doorway and leaned out while I still stared at the safe.

“Beers and sex?” she said.

I squinted at her silhouette in the dark door frame. The way a lover squints at the other wondering how they ever got so lucky.

“I’m still a little full. Sex then beers,” I said wiggling my finger knowingly.

“My man’s a genius.” I stepped inside and she took my hand, and I locked the door behind us.

Later that night, I removed myself limb by limb from post sex spooning and snatched a sweating beer off the nightstand. I walked into the warm hall and looked over my shoulder. Caroline hadn’t so much as stirred. She was sprawled on top of the sheets where it was still hopelessly too hot to sleep.

*What do you call warm fall?* I wondered.

“Indian summer,” I whispered to myself and brought the beer to my lips. Every fall is hot now. It needs a new name; normal.

I walked into the little upstairs den. Five years and the electrical in there still didn’t work. It was embarrassing, sure. But fuck it’s mad how fast five years can pass.

I squinted, trying to remember what the original quote had been to fix the lights, but a scratching sound took my attention away.

I never did find that rodent. But wasn’t it supposed to be dead? With the subfloor and the windows opened the small had seemed to go away. Or perhaps I just got used to it.

The scratching continued. Harder and heavier. The subfloor was strangely walled off in sections, so I couldn’t poke a flashlight into where I’d found the safe and see in every direction.

I wasn’t about to get to drilling with Caroline trying to sleep so I stood and crossed my arms. Something caught my eye on the floor from where the safe had been sitting.

I went back to the bedroom and came back with my phone’s flashlight shining.

There were tiny words carved in the dusty floor. Short sentences neatly tiered above one another. Some of the letters overlapped. Like it had been written in the dark.

“Six foot one.

Burns on right arm.

Brown eyes.

No hair.

My age.

He said his name was Sam.”

\- Sarah Child 1989”

I sat down where the floor opened. My feet further below me near the carving. “Sarah Child,” I said the name aloud.

Of all the strange jokes you could play on the homeowners and remodelers of the future this was up there.

I swallowed my spit nervously as I opened my phone and typed the name into Google.

“Thirty years later, the disappearance case of Sarah Child is just as cold as it was the day she went missing.”

I read on. Sarah Child went missing in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania at sixteen-years-old. She simply never showed up after walking back from a recital rehearsal late one winter night.

That was it. No leads. No sightings. No nothing.

Just a town gone mad with imagination.

We were in Hellertown, just south of Bethlehem. I don’t remember ever hearing of the case but then again, I was born in ‘86 and there were plenty of disappearances in the populated Lehigh Valley.

I clicked my phone off and shook my head. This was either a poor taste prank by some kids enthralled with the disappearance at the time, or, I shivered, at some point a young girl was entombed in our subfloor.

And why, I wondered. Why did that name sound so familiar?

I sat in the silence for a long time. I heard the air conditioner start to whirl from our bedroom window. Over the next several minutes I’d flinch when the house creaked as it cooled.

I thought logically and soon felt relief. Whoever had set that safe down there had no doubt seen the message. The police had possibly already been informed. It was probably a prank. Definitely a prank.

At least that’s what I told myself to sleep that night.

\_\_\_\_

The next morning when I got back from the hardware store Caroline was still asleep. I was aware then of the thought that whoever placed the safe there had also taken Sarah Child. Perhaps opening it was tampering with evidence. But I felt I’d look like a fool calling the police on what I had convinced myself into thinking was some kind of game.

If there was something fishy in the safe then I’d call them, I decided. Otherwise, there’s no need to waste anybody’s time.

I rolled the safe to the middle of the backyard, fitted the new blade in the circular saw and got to work. Not long after I started Caroline came running outside.

“What are you doing?!”

I stood confused and took out my ear plugs. I gestured like an idiot at the safe. “Opening it.”

“Michael, it’s 7 in the morning. We have neighbors.”

I looked around as if they might be watching me angrily. Waiting another hour or more to get to work would drive me nuts but I relented and went inside to eat.

“I knew you’d be obsessed, but what’s up? You’re no early riser.”

I debated not telling her about the writings. I don’t know why. Perhaps it would become realer if I told her. Perhaps I was afraid she’d want to call the police before I got to open the safe myself.

“In the subfloor,” I said slowly. “There’s some kind of prank written there.”

“What?”

“It’s where the safe was. Just go look.” I pointed towards the stairs and she frowned at me as she turned and went up them.

I was tapping my coffee mug anxiously when my heart stopped.

“Oh my god.” I heard Caroline say in horror. “Oh my god.”

“What?” I started towards the stairs. “What is it?” I said as I ran up them.

She was bent over the writing with her hand over her mouth.

“What?”

“Sarah?” She started shaking her head. She was crying. “This can’t be… Sarah Child, do you know who that is?”

“I Googled it.”

“My mom’s cousin,” she cried. “That’s the one that went missing when I was just a girl.”

“It’s just some prank, though, don’t you think?”

She said nothing for a moment. “This description…”

“What about it?”

“In high school,” she trailed off but it’s all I needed to know. While my memory of her mentioning Sarah Child was hazy, I knew what she was thinking.

When Caroline was younger, she had a stalker. He’d gone as far as pretending to be her father and tried to pull her out of elementary school. His behavior wasn’t consistent. She said he’d vanish for a year at a time before appearing outside her bedroom window. Sometime around her sophomore year of high school he vanished altogether.

“Does it sound like him?” My heart pounded. “What did he say his name was?”

“He never did,” Caroline looked around the room and shook her head. “Maybe I’m just remembering wrong. Do we call someone? I mean what if the people that used to live here have something to do with Sarah going missing?”

“This place was abandoned until the 90’s. This subfloor was probably exposed then and it’s not all that crazy that some drunk teens in a creepy house wrote a message knowing it’d be found one day.”

“I want to call someone.”

“Like the police?”

“I don’t know. I just hate to think that she…” She suddenly stood and backed towards me.“That that poor girl was trapped in here.”

“Ok, first thing Monday we’ll call someone.”

She nodded and suddenly frowned. “The safe.”

“Yeah?” I said anxiously.

“What if there’s something in there?”

“Well,” I smiled trying to cheer her up. “Then you’d owe me twenty bucks.”

We took turns sawing. Caroline was much more enthusiastic than me now. I’d stop the saw as flakes of molten metal stung my arms and face, but she’d saw on, unfazed.

After a while we got the metal back peeled away, but there was still a layer of concrete we’d have to break through. I had the small handheld sledge on standby and Caroline took it from me without a word and started swinging.

It crumbled away and she tossed the chunks of cement into the yard.

“Anything?” I said as she peered inside.

She stuck her hand in and pulled out a fist full of what looked like paper.

“What is it?” I walked over cautiously.

“Pictures,” she said and then I saw her eyes widen in fear. “Michael,” she fanned some of the photos towards me and I looked. “Michael, they’re pictures of me.”

I grabbed some from her as she took more from the safe. They were photographs of Caroline as a baby. A toddler. We sorted through them all. The newest photos seemed to be from around the time she turned 10. There were none where she was older. They were family photos. Taken by her parents, it seemed.

“Ok,” I said. “And you never saw this safe before?

Caroline ignored me as she dug her phone out of her pocket.

“Caroline?”

She held up a finger to quiet me as she put her phone to her ear.

“Hey, mom,” she started to pace anxiously around the yard. “Actually, I’m not sure we should still do dinner. James has a cold. Yeah, I’ll make sure he gets tested. No. I feel fine, mom.”

She was quiet for a moment while her mom spoke. “I’m actually calling because I’ve been… looking for some photographs. Physical photos of me when I was younger.”

“Speaker!” I hissed and Caroline put the call on speaker phone.

“Oh,” Caroline’s mom sighed. “How come?”

“Michael was showing me some pictures of him when he was a kid and it just got me thinking.”

“This is a bit embarrassing, Carry. But your father and I… we misplaced your picture books. We thought they were in the garage but when we went to find them and have them digitized, well, they weren’t there.”

Caroline and I stared at each other. I clicked my thumb nail nervously in my teeth. “When was this?”

“Several years ago, now.”

“Mom. *When*?”

“I can’t say exactly. You try living this long. I’m sorry we lost them.”

“Ok,” Caroline sighed. “It’s ok.”

“Tell her we found them.” I mouthed but Caroline glared and disabled speaker as she put the phone back to her ear

“It’s really ok,” she said. “I’d only look at them once in a decade anyway. Yeah. Yeah, I love you, too. Sure, we’ll try for next Sunday. Love you, bye.”

Caroline brought the phone down.

“Why didn’t you tell her we found them? Why didn’t you ask about the safe?”

“Because she’d freak the fuck out. And she doesn’t know of the safe because it’s been sitting in the floorboards for years.”

She snatched up all the photos and started walking inside.

“Caroline,” I called after her. She went upstairs and came back down a minute later dressed in jeans and a thick hoodie despite the fact that it was already nearly 80 degrees.

“I’m going for a drive.” That was all she said and I felt like I couldn’t ask where.

She went out the door and started her car.

By the time she got home it was dusk. I’d spent the day sitting at the kitchen table drinking beers to calm myself. When Caroline came in, she looked at my empties and snatched a bottle of bourbon from the butcher block.

“I don’t know how you haven’t moved to something harder.”

“Are you ok?” I stood and we hugged. Her clothes were torn, and her cheeks had thin scratches. “What aren’t you telling me?”

She started filling a coffee mug with whiskey. When it was half full, she took a sip, and pulled a photo out of the kangaroo pocket of her hoodie.

I took it from her, and she grimaced and brought the mug to her lips again.

“What’s this?” I said quietly but I knew what it was. It was picture of Caroline. Taken maybe a year or two ago based on her shorter hair. She was laughing in the orange glow of a window. The kitchen window.

The picture was taken at night from the backyard.

On the back of the photo there was a simple smiley face. With a long wide smile and sideways rectangles for eyes.

“That’s his signature.”

“What?”

“The man who used to follow me when I was a girl. The smiley face. He sighed his last note to me like that.”

“Was this in the safe?”

She nodded. I looked at the kitchen window. The same one Caroline had been photographed from and raced over to draw the blinds.

“That’s not going to do much good.”

“What?” I paused. “What do you mean? This has to be him, right? He’s back.”

“Yeah.” I frowned as she flicked the wheel of a lighter and lit the end of a cigarette.

“Caroline?”

“There’s a problem with that.”

“What?”

“The man that followed me when I was still just a girl…”

There was a thump upstairs and we both paused and looked towards the stairs.

“I killed him thirteen years ago.”

I could hear the tobacco burn as she drew on her cigarette. “And I just checked where I buried him, and wouldn’t you know it?” Her eyes searched the ceiling.

“He’s not there [anymore](https://www.reddit.com/r/thespookyplace/).”

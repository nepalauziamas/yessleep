Hello Greg here. I wasn't gonna make an update so soon but I have good news. The horror called the "Stalker" has been caught. We used mushrooms to scare it into a trailer.

I thought I would share another story. This one has backstory that predates me working For the 'TIC'

A week after the awakening when reports of unknown creatures started to surface there was a report of a flying man with red eyes. The team went to investigate and didn't just find one but a legion of these horrors. They were nice and friendly. Even offered the investigators food and water. The investigators took one back to study. After some tests it was determined to be a highly evolved moth. "Mothmen". 

The rest of the legion didn't like that one of their friends was taken so they started to attack humans. Because of this they were labelled a threat and killed except two that are kept in a very secure cell. 

Anyway my story with them involved being tasked with cleaning their cell. I was annoyed but I was told I would be payed extra so I agreed to the task. 
The cleaning went well since both of them were asleep. I was finished quicker than I thought it would be, and I went to leave when I tripped over and I woke up the moths. They walked over and helped me up. I thanked them And walked to the door quickly. 

They followed. I got to the door and went to leave but they got in the way and refused to let me leave. One of them grabbed me and threw me to the ground. It then started to bite at me and throw me around. The other one joined in.


They would bite me. Scratch me. Throw me. They would pull on my limbs and bash my head into the wall.
It was around an hour of beating when they stopped. I was covered in cuts and bruises. I got up and ran to the door and escaped. I contacted the uppers and explained what happened. They told me the Mothmen hate humans so it wasn't unexpected. I was angry. Why would they send me into a room with creatures that wanted to beat me up? 

I talked to one of my colleagues two days later and they said "The Uppers send people into the Mothmen cell to be tortured as it helps keep the Mothmen from becoming depressed and feeling helpless." I realised I wasn't being paid to clean the cell. I was being paid to be use as a punching bag by the Mothmen.

 
I have one more entity to talk about. Unlike the other past ones this one is human and may be the most powerful. Her name is "Jezebel" and she has the power to shapeshift into anything with Zero limitations. Because of this it was impossible to keep her in a cell as she would just Shapeshift into a form of herself that can't be contained. Meaning the doors would unlock the second they were locked. She could shapeshift into a form of herself that could teloport and just leave. The uppers considered everything from execution to trapping her in the time world.

But instead they decided to construct a microchip that turns off her powers. They told her about this chip and told her she can be free provided she gets the microchip and she agreed. She has check ups every now and than to make sure the Microchip is functional. She is a nice person but she is considered threat number one as she could basically destroy the universe if she wanted.

Anyway. I may do one more update. But that may be far in the future.

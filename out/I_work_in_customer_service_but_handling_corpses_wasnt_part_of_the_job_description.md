 It was the blood on the ceiling that finally convinced me to seek help handling my bed and breakfast. 

I didn’t mind getting my hands dirty. That comes with the territory in customer service. I don’t mind getting my hands *bloody*, either; that comes with the territory of [this particular house](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/wbzzqt/i_work_in_customer_service_but_no_one_deserves/). 

Not even the legal aspects are beyond my threshold. I do occasionally face awkward questions from the Massachusetts State Police, but those questions never seem to go anywhere. It’s almost as though they’re afraid to ask. 

No, the worst part was trying to reach the damn bloody ceiling with an upside-down mop that kept plopping coagulated goop onto my forehead. I managed little more than to smear it around the wooden beams above. My husband and I were both 5’ 5”, and there was no one else to help us with the job.

“I’m looking for a job, and can help you with that.”

I gooped my underwear at the interruption. Spinning around, clutching my mop tight for protection, I stared at the bedroom door.

A lanky teenage boy with haunting, sunken eyes stared back at me. He wore drab clothing with suspenders that looked extremely out of place. 

“Why would you want to do that?” I snapped. 

He offered a wan smile and shrugged. “I need a job,” he responded. “I don’t mind mopping, and I’m 6’ 3”.”

I looked from the boy, down to the mop, up to the blood-covered ceiling, down at my bloody water bucket, and finally back to him. 

“Can you start right now?”

Abel’s second day was going well until he called me into a room that needed to be guest-ready in twenty minutes.

Up until that point, he did better than most adults ever had. Rooms were clean after being told once, he didn’t squirm at messes, and he had a bizarrely innate ability to figure out where everything was stored in Watcher House.

I don’t blame him for calling me to help, though.

“Do you know what these are?” he asked as my blood lowered to the temperature of cold soup.

“They’re long bones, and they’re human,” I whispered as I stared at the pile. “They weren’t here last night, and they come from at least three different people.”

“How do you know that?” Abel asked, his voice calm as ever. 

“Because no human has three different skulls,” I whispered. “Please remove the cover from the dry cistern. I can’t have these lying around next time the police stop by to check on a suspected murder.”

Abel didn’t see anything unusual on the third day, because he didn’t experience everything that I did. I had been cleaning an upstairs room by myself when heavy breathing came from the hallway. 

I’ve spent enough time in Watcher House to know when fear is about to freeze the shit right in my colon, so I clenched up. The noise increased as I approached the bedroom door; something was sitting around the corner, just out of sight. I held my breath as I curled my head slowly into the hallway.

A splash of morning light illuminated a little girl who sat cross-legged, facing away from me. Her arms worked furiously on something that I could not see.

Why do we force ourselves to look closer when we know we’ll hate the answers we find?

Because humans are dipshits, every one of us.

I crept toward her, peeking over the girl’s shoulder, confused at what I was seeing.

That’s because birds usually have feathers, and I didn’t recognize a naked one at first. She had plucked a tiny body that now looked like a writhing pile of pink skin usually found beneath a scab that had been picked far too early. 

But that animal was too damaged to make noise. The rat in her hands, however, squeaked in pain as her fingers flew across its exposed belly. She had pulled most of its hair off, tossing it into the pigeon feathers to form a bizarre pile of soft, downy hurt. 

Then the little girl lifted her head. Slowly turning her neck toward me, she dropped her jaw into a wide smile. 

There were no irises. Her eyes were solid white. 

I backed away, leaving the cleaning unfinished, and crept down the stairs.

After checking my records, I confirmed that none of the current guests had traveled with a child. 

I didn’t go upstairs for the rest of the day.

“Shouldn’t the sun have risen by now?” Abel asked me upon entering the room on his fourth day.

My stomach dropped as I raced to the window and threw back a curtain. “*Shit.*”

“It’s nearly 8:00 a. m., and it summertime,” he continued. 

I closed my eyes and pressed my fingertips against my temples. “Did we disturb anything this week?” I muttered under my breath. 

“We disturbed the gentleman in Room 3, who didn’t respond to our knocks and thought we wouldn’t go into his room. I heard that sort of activity can turn a man blind.”

“Not him,” I snapped. Then my breath stopped. “The bones.” I turned to face Abel. “Did you put the bones into the cistern, just as I asked?” I breathed.

He looked back at me with soft gray eyes and nodded. “Yes ma’am.”

I clenched my fists. “Then I was wrong to do so.” I stepped closer. “Can you go into the cistern, pull them out, and arrange them just as they were in the room where they first appeared?”

He was rolling up his sleeves and heading out the door before I finished talking. That boy was the best employee I ever had, which is why I felt so sad about what happened next.

The fifth day was Abel’s final. At first, I thought he would be scared by the door at the end of the hallway, because it hadn’t existed before. But he just took it in stride, as he did everything else. 

“I have to take care of it,” he announced, his voice calm.

“No,” I clambered, blocking his path. “There are things about Watcher House that I haven’t revealed to you.” I sighed. “I told myself that it was because you’re too young, but the reality is that I don’t want to lose the best employee I’ve ever had after less than a week, and I think the truth would make that happen.”

He smiled at me, and it seemed to come from someplace far away. “You really think I haven’t understood that this a very strange place?”

I folded my arms and looked down. “You’re a smart boy, but there are things that you can’t understand at fifteen.”

I looked up after he didn’t respond right away.

“I was that age in 1913,” he responded. 

My jaw fell. 

“The door is here for me.” He smiled. “Thank you for taking care of our home.” He strode across the hall and grabbed the handle.

“Wait!” I cried, not knowing what I was about to say. 

Abel looked back. 

“Will I see you again?”

He looked at the door. “I’ve seen you before, so you’ll probably see me again. It always surprises me to realize how many people don’t know what’s looking back at them from [inside their walls](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/).”

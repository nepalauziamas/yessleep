These days you can look at Tiktok, Instagram stories, or what have you, and see Native Americans joking about our experiences with our monsters and folklore. For example, sacrificing friends as “Skinwalkers” chase you to your homes, or hiding at the sound of an owl in the day.

A little gallows humor never hurt us.

Though you have to wonder how this became a thing. How we can make fun of our unease of things that go bump in the night.

I’ve decided it’s a quiet, healthy dose of respect to our fears. To the Gnawing Fear. The fear we Koyukon use for two concepts - the fear of not being able to eat, and the fear of being eaten.

There are many names for the monsters in different Native groups, and even within tribes, for the same creatures. In this recounting, consider them called Transformed One as it’s hutłlaanee to say their true names - and I don’t want to risk their attention ever again.

It was the end of the summer and my senior year of high school was around the corner. That time in Alaska where the sun is still out late but there will be actual darkness at night.

I was stuck on extra chore duty - taking care of not just our, but our neighbor’s dog lots - as punishment for being caught smoking. Like the cool kid I was. I didn’t particularly mind this punishment aside from now needing to be up at 5 AM instead of 6:30 to take care of both lots. Everything else about it was fine, especially evening feeding being a good excuse to separate from all the young cousins.

Things had been going well that summer. I’d spent a lot of evenings hanging out with Christi and my cousin Mary. I beat my record of salmon catch at fish camp. I’d even gone on a date with that guy David. Life was good that summer but that wouldn’t be what made it memorable.

One day I was leaving the evening feeding and my cousin Mary rode up to me on her 4 wheeler. “Hey, you seen Uncle Martin?”

I shook my head. “Nah. Not since before he left for his hunt the other day.” I took a second and finally asked, “Gimme a ride.” With her nod I jumped on the back and held tight until we got to the usual trail head. Helmets off we finally began our usual chatter before things turned serious.

“You know the adults are actin’ weird lately.” Mary said.

“Really? Like what?”

“They’re at Grandpa Leo’s a lot lately.”

I sighed. Grandpa Leo, our last shaman. Or who we all assumed would be the last one. But… that story’s for another time. “They’re probably using his place to plan the searches. He’d be the one with the sight to say where to look.”

“Tha’s the thing. They stopped lookin’ fer ‘im.” I could tell Mary was getting agitated as her Native accent became stronger. We’d both been sent to the city for our high school years and within the first year had our accents worked out of us. You’d never hear it unless we were surrounded by our elders or under stress.

“Tch. Someone’s gotta be out there on his trail.”

“There is no trail.” Mary mumbled.

“How do you know?”

“Cuz’ my da’ was called off the hunt.”

“Well luckily this is the job of the adults, neh? So stop worrying.”

Mary sighed. “Fine. But don’t be s’prised when yer da' tells ya stay in.”

We were halfway through to our normal spot when I got that creeping feeling of being watched. That feeling where the hairs rise on the back of your neck, and you can barely contain a shiver. You know… that time you’re being watched when you’re completely alone.

I tugged Mary’s sleeve and paused to look around. The expected nothing was behind us, but I knew better than to ignore that feeling in the woods. I also may not be 100% superstitious but I knew not to say it out loud. So I turned us back, speaking about nothing in particular, with pauses at regular intervals to look over our shoulders. Ignoring the hidden eyes.

Once safely back in the edges of town we were finally able to acknowledge it. “You felt that too?” Mary asked.

“Yeah. What do you think it was?”

“I dunno. There haven’t been any sightings of anything big lately.”

“Hmm…” I wondered aloud. “Or maybe… it was one of the damn boys trying to scare us again.”

“No. They’d have popped out and thrown things at us.”

“Neh. Let’s just get back.”

We went our separate ways and once the night finally came around my father returned. After taking off his boots and coming inside he sighed at me. I watched him run his hand through his hair - the habit he has before telling me bad or questionable news.

I broke the tension for him. “Found Uncle Martin?”

“No.” He looked at a loss for words for a moment before he continued. “Don’t go out at night.”

I stared. “What?”

“Just… don’t do it.” He looked at me, still mulling over his thoughts. “Be careful with your soul.”

Ah, yes, the man of few words would never give me more than the summary. He’d also make sure to convey whatever Grandpa Leo said… and unfortunately leave out what would later be the important parts.

“Alright.” I pointed into the kitchen. “Rice, fish, and green beans are on the stove.” I yawned and saw it was already 11. I had 6 hours before I needed to be up and at the first lot. “Night.”

My father nodded and he walked into the kitchen as I went to bed.

As always, 5 AM came far too soon. The sun still had an hour to come up so I relied on my flashlight to head out to the first neighbor’s dog lot. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary through my sleep addled brain. I was a few minutes into my walk toward the edge of town where the lots were when I finally woke up and had some awareness of my surroundings.

Now what was it my father had said the night before? Oh yeah… don’t go out at night.

“Tch. It’s morning now and I’m doing chores. This doesn’t count as night.” I said to myself. “Still… it would be nice if the 4 wheeler weren’t broken.” Walking at night was what really bothered me.

I was still a couple minutes to the first lot and I didn’t hear anything out of the ordinary. The world was still quiet aside from a few nocturnal animals.

About the time I’d walk around a bend I began to hear heavier movement ahead of me. My focus zeroed in up the dirt road but nothing was visible in the darkness ahead. It took a lot to scare me. I’d be cautious and alert, but never scared.

Still… something in that dark scared me.

I shook my head and berated myself. I was still in town - on the outskirts yes, but I was definitely in town with a couple houses left along the road. There also hadn’t been sightings of any particularly worrisome animals of late. So I continued my walk as the confident, immortal teenager I was.

Then came the scream. The sound of a human in agony and fear. I could tell it was ahead of me but that became the least of my worries. I froze at a rustle of brush to the left of me. Every nerve in my body focused on that one point and after a moment that felt like days a loud hoot came from the trees to mingle with the cries.

My Gnawing Fear came full force to the center of my being. There wasn’t supposed to be anything big. I tried to turn and run but I couldn’t. I heard screams ahead of me and couldn’t bring myself to leave them. My mind raced.

*Yes, I can run and try to help - I do have a gun with me. Or I can turn back for help at the closest house. But something tells me they won’t be there if I do.*

I felt my stomach drop as I realized why I knew that the nearest person wouldn’t be home. It was because the only other person who would be out there this early would be the owner of the dog lot, Jesse, heading out to help me with the morning feed.

Rage and panic mixed enough I ignored Owl’s next hoot and ran toward the screams. I unholstered my bear revolver and mentally prepared myself for whatever sight would come next. I flipped off my flashlight and adjusted to the moon and starlight before quietly racing up the road.

Now… I had met survivors of wolf attacks, bear maulings, moose stompings, etc. I had seen the leftovers of casualties as well. It would never prepare me for seeing that kind of mauling in action. It also could also never prepare me for what… “It” was.

At first I thought it was a bear. The massive creature was hunched over a figure on the ground. I could hear the chewing and smacking of its mouth mixed with the faint groans of the twitching body under it. I felt further distress when I realized its back was to me. I could never get a clear head shot and all shooting the hindquarters of a bear would do is piss it off further.

With no time to spare I began striding sideways along the trees, hoping its attention wouldn’t turn toward me. Even staying as far away as I could, when I reached the side of it I realized something. This was too thin and long to be a bear. No… it was probably just ill and emaciated.

I continued my strides until I was almost completely around it and froze. I had not been prepared for the sight before me. The black on the ground surrounding the bear and person, the muffled moans into the dirt, the scalp peeled from my friend’s skull… the great maw chewing off a leg.

I did the worst thing you could do… I vomited. My throat burned and the smell of it mixed with the scent of iron in my nose. The silence I had worked so hard to maintain was broken. The form jerked its head up at me, pulling a piece of thigh up with it.

I vomited again. It wasn’t a bear... It was a nightmare.

The ugly snout pulled into what can only be described as a wicked grin, splitting its face in two. The red inside almost seemed to glow as the darkness of blood dripped down its teeth and its chin. The body… blackened like ash with wirey fur covering its legs and back.

It relaxed its long hands from my friend’s body and stood up. This… was definitely not a bear.

I had almost forgotten the gun in my hand until it took one step forward. I calmed my breathing enough to raise… aim… and fire. In my fear I barely held on through the recoil of the massive revolver and had to wait for my eyes to adjust again after the flash.

The creature stopped and gave an unearthly howl. If I could describe it… it would be a mixture of the screams of murdered rabbits, the roar of a bear, and scratching of chalkboards. To make it worse… I watched two dots gleam into existence below its eyes. It took me a second to realize I was looking at another set of eyes that were somehow glowing even though they were black.

Now it stepped forward with much more speed but I could tell it was still taking its time. Even with a hole in its shoulder it didn’t seem hurt, only mildly inconvenienced. I felt warmth on my face. I had begun crying in terror. I was barely able to hold onto my gun because of how much I was shaking. The immortal teenager was looking at death.

I turned and ran. Screw my neighbor, I needed to save myself. The Gnawing Fear overwhelmed me. I ran down the dirt road as fast as my legs could carry me but with swift silence I hit the ground face first. I could only groan into the dirt, my head was pushed so hard into the ground my mouth couldn’t open to scream. Then I felt jerking around my body as I realized the creature was beginning to leisurely tear at me and shredding its way through my jacket. I tried to push up and found it useless. My head wasn’t going anywhere and it had stepped on my legs to keep me from kicking out.

Then I felt an excruciating pain I’ll never forget. My back was ripped open. I jerked my head up strong enough my face turned and I screamed. I didn’t know how badly I was hurt, just that it felt like there was nothing there anymore - that there was no way there would be anything but bone after that.

The next moment I felt my right shoulder dislocate from the force of the monster tearing down my back once again. I could barely believe there had been anything left to rip into. Then came the sound of something that made me wish it had already gutted me. It rumbled through its hand that was holding down my head and I felt it give slight convulsions.

It began laughing. Mocking me. In the most heinous sound imaginable. I had thought its scream before had been from hell, but this was something indescribable. I can only say it sounded like a concept. Whatever you fear most repeated over and over in your head until your soul gives up. It was as if the laugh would steal all hope and the desire to live from any lifeform that would hear it. It felt as if that was almost the point.

And... it did work. My soul gave up and I felt my will to live crack. And it knew it. It knew it so well it lightened its hand on my head and allowed me to scream. I looked at the hand now resting next to my face. Its long fingers ending in claws and had both an opposable thumb and a bird’s rear talon. I laughed maniacally at the unfairness of it all as now a taunting slice was pulled down my dislocated arm.

As I laid there something both miraculous and indescribably lucky happened. I heard the sound of a 4 wheeler. There was no reason to hope it was someone who would find us - no one else had business out here. But it was enough. The monster’s attention jerked and I could see it turn its ears in the direction of the sound.

In that release, I regained enough sense to realize again that I wanted to live. That hope still existed. That… hope was so real my gun really hadn’t flown that far away when I was tackled. Stupid… stupid… stupid. I’d had a gun! I slowly reached out my hand toward it while the creature was distracted. Slowly. Ever so slowly.

Then pain once more as the hand slammed down onto my wrist. I screamed and saw white. Hope was gone once more and a cry of anger came from above me. I had no more tears in my dirt filled eyes left.

Another raking down my back and my body relaxed. I truly gave up. It seemed fitting that I would die as the sun rose. After all, I had disobeyed and went out at night. I watched the sky slowly lighten on the horizon and realized that the sun would be the last thing I saw. One more breath… just one more breath and the next can be the last.

Then that scream. That terrible scream I had heard minutes ago when I’d shot a hole through the creature’s shoulder. I felt my body pressed down then all weight taken off of it.

Did I die? Did I no longer feel because I was close to death? As I watched the sunrise I knew I wasn’t dead yet. The monster was gone, but I was still here. Here and alone, left to bleed out with no one to find me.

The world had gone quiet like cotton was in my ears and I barely registered the sound of a truck coming down the road. The sound of feet moving toward me, the cries for help. What I did was feel. I felt pain all over as I suddenly floated. My entirety, wet and sticky as my back was wrapped tight in blankets.

I was able to see more than just the sunrise now as I was shifted around. The sunrise had brought hope again.

The next while is boring - after all, you know I’m alive. I had decided once again I wanted to live and I fought for my life. My back was held together by blankets and someone popped my shoulder into place. Then a long medi-vac to Fairbanks. Drugs. Copious amounts of drugs. Surgeries. Days and months of rehab.

And finally I went home. I went home to a small town in the middle of nowhere Alaska.

A small town where Uncle Martin had been found days after I was. Dead, naked, starved, and black as ash.

A small town where Elders took care of me, and Grandma Anna smeared poultices on my back everyday. Which… they worked. I only look like a whipping victim and not the victim of a mauling.

Now… You’d think that’d be the end of it. That all that would be left is me being used as a lesson to the children - “Listen to your elders or the Transformed Ones will get you like her.”

Yet they won’t let me forget this event happened to me. I’m not just a tale of warning. To this day, as an adult, my Elders from my small town are still telling me I need healing. That that night my soul’s shadow, my *yega*, was ripped open, leaving my core soul exposed.

But I’m too old for those specific tales. After all, how could anything break through your soul?

The flower shambled towards us. We shivered even though it wasn't very cold. As it came closer I could smell the same odor on it that the other flowers gave off, except it was more pungent than foul. A strong smell but still bearable I could breathe through my nose with this flower up close. The tube was still dripping blood and other fluids that I couldn't identify. From where I stood, it looked like there had been a struggle in the room before the flower finally ate Roland. There aren't too many good ways to die, but being eaten alive is a pretty bad one.

The flower stopped right in front of us. It leaned forward. I reached out and put my hand on its tube. "What are you doing?" Stephanie asked. I pet the tube gently. It leaned against my waist and nuzzled me. I would have been less surprised if it had tried to eat me. One of the roots that was more like a tendril started to wag. The flower was acting like a dog.

I was about to exhale when Stephanie nudged me and pointed to the broken window. The other flowers--red, orange, and yellow--were poking their tubes out through the hole. They had grown in the last few minutes as well, and judging by the way their tubes flared upon seeing us, I sensed that they were hungry. We started to back away slowly. The blue flower turned and looked at the red and yellow ones. They were already slithering out of the shattered window, their roots undulating beneath them as they moved. The odor they gave off was foul, and I found that I was having difficulty breathing through my nose again. As we backed away, the blue flower moved with us. It did not like the red and yellow ones any more than we did.

The red and yellow flowers started to move faster. They weren't as big as the blue flower, but there were more of them and they were still a lot bigger than any flowers I'd ever seen. One of the red ones lunged at Stephanie. The blue one knocked it aside with a root. We turned and ran. Another one lunged, catching me by the shoe and pulling it off.  Something burned my foot and I howled, pulling off my sock by pressing down on it with my other shoe before I started running again. Stephanie slowed for me, and we rounded the side of the building back to the small landing where we had sat and talked. The blue flower was behind us, but not far behind.

I looked down at my root. It was red and bleeding, like something had eaten through the skin. "What should we do?" I asked. The pain was making my eyes water. "If we lead them into the woods--"

"Upstairs," said Stephanie, fitting her key into the lock in the door. "I have something in my room that can help."

I followed Stephanie through the door as quickly as I could. The blue flower followed us and the door had barely shut behind it when the red and yellow flowers appeared on the other side. They were just a little slower than the blue flower. Maybe they would be faster after they had eaten. I hoped they did not get the chance.

They started to bang their tubes against the window in the door. We ran up the stairs, which was difficult for me with what I guess was acidic saliva eating my foot. The blue flower slithered along behind us. We ran down the hall of the second floor. A man ahead of us opened his door, peeked out, and closed his door very quickly. So the place wasn't completely deserted aside from us. Stephanie's room was in the middle of the hall. She opened the door and the three of us entered the room. "My roommate won't be back for a while," said Stephanie, flipping on the light.

"Does she know about all this?" I asked. The smell wasn't so bad anymore. Maybe because the flowers had gone outside. That wouldn't last, of course. I hadn't heard the window in the door downstairs shatter, but that didn't mean anything. My foot was still burning. I sat down at Stephanie's desk and looked at it without touching it. It was beet red and the pain was getting worse.

"Here," said Stephanie. She grabbed her water bottle off the desk and poured its contents all over my foot. The pain lessened, becoming gradually bearable.

"Have you seen those things before?" I asked. The blue flower slithered up and down the room, its tube to the floor. I suppose it was looking for interesting smells. It stopped at a pair of Stephanie's roommate's shoes before moving on to the wastebasket. You haven't lived until you have seen a plant do that.

"My roommate did," said Stephanie. "She went into their room once when they weren't there. I think she stole a master key from somewhere."

"What happened?" I asked. Stephanie had grabbed a roll of bandages out of a desk drawer and was wrapping my foot. I glanced at the door. It was a heavy door, probably strong enough that the flowers wouldn't be able to break it down. Then again, what if they just spit on it?

"One of the flowers drooled on her," she said. "It got on her shirt and she pulled it off and ran up here before anyone else could see her."

"Are the flowers...smart?" I asked.

"Not as smart as we are," she said. "But they're not like other plants."

I glanced at the blue flower, which was now chasing its own tendril. "I believe that. You said you have something here that could help. What is it?"

Stephanie finished bandaging my foot and crossed to her wardrobe. She pulled out a can of spray paint and handed it to me. I stared at it, puzzled. If she had handed me Lysol spray or pesticide, I suppose I could have understood why that would repel the flowers. But I had no idea why spray paint would stop them.

"It's the smell," said Stephanie. "They can't stand it. I think because it's unnatural."

"How did you even find that out?" I asked.

"My roommate," said Stephanie. "She talked to Curtis one time. Got him to go into the woods and have a couple beers with her. He kept talking about what smells he liked. It was really weird. He said he's fine with the smell of shit and dead bodies but he can't stand the smell of paint. If the paint is wet, he can't go into the building. I figured he wasn't talking just about himself, also the plants too."

"So you don't know if it works?" I said. Stephanie shrugged. That was not very reassuring.

"One thing's been bugging me this whole time," I said. "What's Curtis and Roland's plan? Well, I guess it's just Curtis now. But what the fuck are they trying to do?"

The blue flower had stopped chasing its own tendril and came closer to us. It flopped down at my feet looking dejected. I couldn't exactly read its mind, but it looked bored. Dogs hate being stuck inside all day, especially in a small room. Maybe what these flowers really wanted was to go out and live in the wilderness. I bet El Chupacabra's lonely. He might find a kindred spirit in these guys.

"We can't just stay in here," I said. "Maybe we should just call 911. We don't have to tell them about the flowers. Just tell them somebody's died. It's not even a lie."

"But what are they gonna do when they get here and some walking flower tries to eat them?"

"The cops have guns," I said. "They can just shoot--" Somebody was opening the door. Stephanie and I had been listening for something to try to break it down, but we weren't expecting a human to open it.

"You're home early," said Stephanie as the door swung open. But it wasn't her roommate who opened the door. An olive-skinned man with a week or two of facial hair growth and shoulder-length, curly hair stood in the doorway with four or five red and yellow flowers surrounding him. They all slithered forward as he stepped into the room.

"Curtis," said Stephanie.

"Stephanie," said Curtis, and nodded to me too. "How's your foot?"

"Fine," I said. "Why do you care?"

"Because they're not big enough yet to swallow you whole," he said. "They're gonna have to eat you one limb at a time. It's not gonna be over for you as quickly as it was for Roland." He sounded a little choked up when he said his friend's name. I suppose even creeps have somebody who is important to them.

I held my can of spray paint behind my back. If Curtis saw anything suspicious there, he didn't say so. Stephanie was slowly reaching into the wardrobe. Maybe she had another can in there. The paint in my can was the same as one of our school colors. Fighting carnivorous flowers with spray paint would be a strange way of showing our school spirit, but not the weirdest thing that had happened this evening.

The blue flower raised itself up and positioned itself between me and Curtis and the flowers. It made a sound that was a little like a growl. The red and yellow flowers growled back as Curtis stroked their tubes. "Eat," he said. The flowers [lunged](https://www.reddit.com/user/_Cu_Chulainn17).

This situation is HILARIOUS 

I (16) am the product of my mother's affair, she cheated on her first husband, and when she found out she was pregnant, her and my father got married (of course after getting an official divorce from her first husband), I grew up in a wealthy home, my mother is a doctor and my father is a lawyer. 

I get an allowance every week, as long as I do all of my chores, I saved up my allowance for WEEKS so I could "take myself out" on my 16th birthday, so today comes and I headed to the mall by 930 am, I planned to just take myself shopping, and watch a movie. As I entered the mall it was 10:12am so I headed to the theater my movie starts and 1030, fast forward to after the movie I went to an ice cream shop and this is where the "drama" begins. I sat down with my order and began eating and scrolling through Instagram, during me minding my business a woman and what I presume is her child walked in and went to the register and did the whole order, pay, receive then they sat at the table behind me.

As the time went by my Facebook messenger notifications went off, family telling me happy birthday, the mother looked into her purse, and then nearly broke her neck with how quick she looked back at me, she told me to "Give her the phone", I was absolutely caught off guard and just stared at her for a couple of seconds before asking "what?"

Em (entitled mom): Give me my phone before I call the police
Me: I don't have your phone miss...
Em: Excuse me? I just heard it go off, Give it to me
Me: That was my phone ma'am
Em: BULLS*IT, GIVE ME MY PHONE
I moved to the other side of my table when she began screaming
Me: *Raises my phone* See this is mine
Em: THATS MINE, GIVE IT TO ME!

Here's where I might be the jerk, I laughed right into her face, and kept laughing when she began calling me names and others were saying I'm rude for laughing at her, now the mall security is here lol, I can't wait to unlock the phone and prove it's mine LMFAOO.

Edit: Update!
The mall security let us both explain what happened, the little kid of hers sided with her, of course the little sht would, so I got up from my seat boldly and put my fingerprint on the button to unlock my phone. It declined. So with confusion I did my face instead, declined. So I just put the pin, it fcking declined. I was confused. That when I looked at the lock screen, it was the kids face. I looked up at the woman, why can't I describe her, she has a face but where are the details? 

The mall security looked at me and told me to hand the phone to the lady, I handed it over. As I received the phone I put in my pin and it worked, my phone opened to a home screen picture of my late husband. I showed the teen and the mall security that it was opened, the teen slowly sat back down, I looked at her in pity, as her body language was showing that she was crushed and confused, I went to go say that it was alright but that's when I saw her face. It wasn't a face or it's lacking the features of a face, where are her eyes? Where are any of their eyes, I thought as I began looking around, I looked at my son, he was the only one with a facial feature but it only his mouth, he was grinning, ear to ear.. *crack* I looked back at the teen, she only had her body, where was her head? There was a blackish red liquid that just came spraying out of her, what the fuck is going, her head rolled towards me, I looked down, it had a face, a feature-full face, I opened its mouth and said

"We find the defendant guilty of second degree murder"
I was carried away as a woman screamed at me saying something along the lines of "she just turned 16" and my son staring at me with pure horror.

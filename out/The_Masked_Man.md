TW; Intruder, talk of a gun.

I was 14 at the time of this taking place, babysitting my little brother. It was around 8:00pm, my parents were gone for a dinner date so it was just me and my little 8 year old brother, Jack. Our living room was on ground level, we were watching a movie, eating popcorn, and eating junk. We were watching some dumb kids movie, like a rip-off of "Toys story". The popcorn bowl was empty and the movie wasn't close to being over so I went to make some more.

I slipped out of the shared blanket, grabbed the popcorn bowl, and headed to the kitchen. Entering the kitchen I went to the pantry, grabbing another bag of popcorn and tossing it in the microwave. I felt somebody watching me, I turned around expecting to see my brother somewhere as he's not one to speak, he's like a ghost, he will just sit and watch. But nothing, I poked my head around the kitchen door, to see Jack peacefully watching the movie, eating a snickers bar or something. I turn back around just in time for the "Beep! Beep! Beep!" from the microwave, popcorns done! Yet I stop dead in my tracks, like a dear in headlights.

Out the window above the sink was a masked man, staring at me. It wasn't an average mask, it looked like a porcelain doll. The eyes too blue, soulless and creepy, and a smile too big with too many teeth on display. The cheeks a bright pink and it's eyebrows pointing down, as if mad. I looked back to check if Jack was okay, thankfully he was. But once I turned back, the masked... THING... was gone, I quickly poured the popcorn into the bowl, handing it to my brother before checking all the locks.

PHEW! Doors and windows are all locked, I went back to the kitchen, my dad had a high cabinet with a lock that held a fully loaded hand pistol, a sharpened dagger, and machete. I unlocked the cabinet thingy and grabbed the pistol and dagger. I walked back to the living room.

"Jack, it's time for bed." I said rather sternly, as he usually fights bedtime.

He grumbled. "But the movies not done, sissy!!" He responded, whining. I quickly became worried as I felt that feeling again, I knew he would be in the window behind me, I refused to look.

"Jack, get your ass up there. I am not fighting you, this isn't the time." I said even more stern this time. I didn't want him to see... it.. so when he finally obliged I turned off the movie and scooped him up, running up the stairs to his bedroom.

I got him into bed. "No matter what you hear, you stay in bed, you don't move, you don't speak, you keep your head on that pillow until I say so." I said, fearing for the worst as I grabbed the house phone beside his bed, as there was one in almost every room. 

"What's going on?" He asked, now scared of the situation.

"Do not worry, just do what sissy says and don't ask questions. Goodnight Jack, I love you." With that I left his room. Locking the door, sitting infront of his door on the floor.

I dialed 9-1-1.

"Hello 911, what's your emergency?"

"HI, there is some masked man looking into the windows of my house. It's just me and my little brother please send help immediately!" I said, tears running down my face.

"Okay, sweetheart, I need your address, then help will he on the way!"

"Uh.. its.. Uh..." CRAP! What is it?! I stumbled over my words "38578, Wonder Road." I stammered out quickly.

"I'm sending dispatchers to your location immediately, stay on the phone until they find you." 

I heard the door open, quickly taking the Pistol and dagger out of my pockets, gripping on to that Pistol with my life. Jack's life is in my hands. "I hear footsteps, he's inside! Please hurry!" I whispered, pointing the gun at the stairs, ready to shoot.

"Help is almost there! Stay calm, don't hang up." The lady on the phone said calmly. 

Tears fell, but I refused to make a noise. 'Thud, thud, thud.' Of footsteps echoed, I continued to hear footsteps all around the downstairs. I shuffled into the corner behind the stairs, where I wouldn't be seen if one was to come up the stairs. 

The footsteps stopped right infront of the stairs. I held my breath as they continued up the staircase, but then, I heard sirens.

The footsteps quickly shuffled down the stairs, with them a deep voice said, "Little bitches called the cops.". I covered my mouth as the sirens stopped infront of my house. I heard whimpers coming from my brothers room, as police started entering I ran into my brothers room. His window was open and muddy footprints were on the floor leading in and out the window. 

My brother was still there. I hugged him tightly, sobbing. I put the pistol down on the nightstand, "It will be okay Jack! Sissy and the police are here, we are okay!" I cried as I hugged him tighter.

A cop entered the room, "I found them! They are in here!!" He shouted as we ran towards us.

We were taken out of the room, but I looked behind me once last time, to see the face, staring back at me. On the window was "Almost got ya!" written in mud. The face waved as I left the room.

And he says that this app of his has some kind of built in translator that puts Google fucking translate to shame. Fucking Google translate! He thinks he can outdo it! The man is insane! He thinks that the translation of the Latin I just wrote is

Moreover, with great effort, there is no one. He wants to work, but work hard. There is neither time nor time but his. Don't be sad, it's never fun. Never be in pain, let it be that there are no great times. It should not be his will any longer. No one wants him or any time. He must seek pleasure in laboring for some reason. His pain was gained by hard work. It's fun to find ways to get pleasure. He wills himself to be followed by pain. They kill as they kill but nobody cares. But he wants to go on with his pain. Moreover, you will receive the same pain. Let no one seek pain in pain. Furthermore, it is not a big deal, nor further. There are times when it is never. Pleasure will be pursued by those who fall into it. Nor does he seek further to be pursued. It is good that pain seeks pleasure. It's time to work hard. Love never but never. I'm going to continue the pain. Not really, but never a big deal. Some of his pursuit of pleasure is pleasure. Let him seek further, and let him die, because there is great grief. No one ever likes him. It's never a fun way to get fun. But it is great that they cut down as hard as they can.

Well anyways he sent me this image album of screenshots from his app. It's a message board app and it has some kind of translator built in. I can't really read the messages because they're in Latin. You can read Latin, right? Then you tell me what is in these images. Thank you very much for your time. At the end of this message, you will find a link to the whole album. Thank you for your time.

edit: sorry guys the mods keep removing my post because it isn't 500 words. but the attached image have hundreds of words. and i've only attached images from like the first four pages. there are 10 pages. and i don't know maybe there are more? maybe there are more messages and i just don't know how to get to them because i am not good with internet stuff. maybe someone could help me figure this out? is there like a database where the messages are being sent from? Or a database that the stuff is being stored at? What kinds of messages are there?

Ok look the mods want my story to be 500 words so I'll just insert some of the messages that are in the photos.

Let no one seek his manners. It is in pain that everyone is and does not seek to seek with effort. He will continue to

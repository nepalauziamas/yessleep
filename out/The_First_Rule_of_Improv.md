My father taught me that the first rule of improv is *You never say no.*

I’ve been a theatre nerd since childhood. It’s in my blood; my father was an acting coach who soaked me dramatic theory from infancy. He wanted me to be everything he wasn’t: a star. An *actor*. It didn’t exactly work out that way, but to this day I love theatre in all its forms. 

For the longest time, my favorite form was improv.

Everyone knows what improv is, even if you think you don’t. It’s a form of comedy where the performers make the scene up as they go along. They *improvise*. You see it all the time on late night TV, occasionally on scripted television, and even in movies.

Improv is great. It hones your sense of humor and comedic timing. It boosts confidence. It teaches you to think quickly, react effectively, and find solutions – not just onstage, but in real life. 

When I was twelve, I joined a community improv group. I was the youngest member by far. Half of them were over thirty; at least a third were over forty. I fit in just fine, though. Theatre is beautiful that way. Age doesn’t matter, just your willingness to do what needs to be done. We were all willing…

Except for Jeff.

Everybody knows a Jeff. Your Jeff might be named Chris or Claire or Caitlin or Tucker or something else entirely. It doesn’t matter. You still know him. Jeff is an expert. Jeff is superior. Jeff always knows the best way to do things, and woe unto you if you dare to defy him.

Jeff knew everything about improv. Jeff was the best performer *and* the best director, because Jeff spent twenty years in New York City performing with the world’s preeminent theatre companies. Jeff was a dramatic genius, and he made sure we all knew it. 

Jeff did his best to control our meetings. He tried to set every scenario. He constantly interrupted scenes to criticize technique, delivery, and timing. He loved telling everyone that they were doing things wrong.

This was a problem, because the second rule of improv is *there are no mistakes, only opportunities.*

But Jeff never saw opportunities. He only saw mistakes.

It wasn’t just the improv group. It was everything. I heard him after meetings sometimes, complaining to other members. “I got my hours cut.”

“Well, Jeff, I can’t make any promises, but I own a business, and –”

Jeff shook his head miserably. “I can’t. It won’t help. It’s me. All me. I always fuck up. The only consolation is I haven’t fucked up in front of any of you.”

This was up for debate, given his penchant for arrogant tyranny, but I figured this wasn’t the time to correct him.

Another time, he lamented the state of his marriage. “I know I’m doing anything right, but I try. I pull all the weight. And it still isn’t right.”

“I know a therapist. It’s through my church but she’s sliding scale, and between you and me she isn’t *too* religious.”

Jeff’s lip curled. “Charlotte doesn’t believe in therapy.”

“For your own peace of mind, maybe you could go alone.”

“Me? I’m already doing all the work. I’m not doing hers, too. I mean, talk about mistakes.”

He even complained about his kids. “I know Mitchell’s on drugs no matter what he says, and who can blame him? If I had his condition, I’d kill myself. That’d be the kindest thing.”

“Jeff…I…I’m sorry, but that’s an awful thing to say.”

Jeff continued obliviously. “Andrea’s flunking out. I knew she would. She’s got brains, but no *sense*. She’ll be knocked up before junior year, nursing some creep’s baby while she leeches off me. Emily’s the only one worth anything, but that’ll change. She’s only eleven. Plenty of time left to go off the rails.” He heaved a tragic sigh.  “I don’t know. These kids were all mistakes.” 

Now, the group leader was an old-school fanatic named Ben. Ben had obviously met many Jeffs in his life, because he got Jeff under control after just a few meetings. Jeff still misbehaved, but didn’t constantly spiral out of control.

Ben was very kind to Jeff, going to far as to let him set a couples scenarios each meeting. Even so, if Jeff was feeling especially pissy, he’d shut us down with one word answers. Then he’d grin while his scene partners faltered, taking pleasure in their inability to keep the performance afloat without him. I still remember the way his eyes looked when he did this: wide, slate grey, glittering meanly.

See, one-word answers are improvisational kryptonite. That’s why the third rule of improv is *Don’t ever stop at yes.*

Believe it or not, it’s not enough to just say yes. You have to add something to the dialog, or the performance stalls.

For example, you can’t stop at *Yes, Diane.* You need more. Something like *Yes, he’ll be here in ten minutes so please, for the love of God, help me hide the body*. Or *Yes, I forgot to wash the car but we wouldn’t need to wash it in the first place if you hadn’t kidnapped Stuart’s monkey.* 

Jeff didn’t like this rule because it meant he had to rely on us. I guess you could say teamwork was Jeff’s kryptonite.

Unsurprisingly, the entire group was overjoyed when Jeff stopped attending.

Everything became brighter: the scenarios seemed better, the dialogue more authentic. Old members – the ones Jeff had chased away - returned. Newcomers joined us. I even talked my friend Em into coming.

Bringing Em was my dad’s idea; her parents were divorcing, and she was quiet. Quiet kids, he said, always got the shaft. “Invite her,” he said. “It’ll be fun.”

Em, unfortunately, was a hard sell; I’d complained about Jeff for so long that I’d spooked her a little.

“What if he comes back?” she asked.

“He won’t,” I assured her. “Ben wouldn’t let him.”

Em finally smiled, grey eyes crinkling happily. “Okay. But you probably have to pick me up and drop me off. Is that okay?”

“Of course!” I was ecstatic; finally, I’d have a friend my age at improv group. It was cause for celebration. 

So I was crushed when nobody answered the door.

I knocked for several minutes, stopping only when I realized I was running late. I tromped back to the car, fighting back unreasonable tears.

“Don’t worry about it, hon,” Dad said. “She’ll probably come next time.”

I forgot my distress once I reached the theatre. Improv group, and acting in general, have that effect. It’s impossible to stay focused on yourself when there are characters to discover and people to become.

Halfway through the meeting – right in the middle of my scene – the door creaked open.

And Jeff walked in.

The silence was suffocating; dust motes danced and shadows crashed against the spotlights, bisecting the auditorium: half dark, half light.


Ben cleared his throat. “Hi, Jeff.”

“Hi.” Jeff shuffled forward. I cringed; even in the darkness, it was clear his hair was greasy and slicked back, his clothes filthy. “Sorry I’m late. Got stuck at my ex-wife’s place.” He plopped into a seat at the end of the first row. “Keep going.”

I did my best, but my voice shook and my delivery was awful. I couldn’t *think*. It was because of Jeff. Not just the fact that he was there, but his *aura*. Negativity rolled off him in waves, thick and noxious as poison gas.

Every flat joke and shrill word made him tense: his shoulders came up high, he crossed his arms, he tapped his foot, he scowled. It drove me to anxious incoherence.

Finally, Ben said, “Jeff, can I talk to you out –”

Jeff threw his head back and screamed. “*Shut the hell up!*”

Silence again, thick and heavy.

Ben drew a deep breath. “Jeff. I need you to leave.”

Jeff shot out of his seat. “I’m not leaving. I am staying right the *fuck* here, and I am running a scenario.”

“Then we’ll all leave instead,” said Ben.

Jeff reached into his belt and pulled out a pistol. People screamed. My scene partner darted offstage. I wanted to follow, I *longed* to follow, but I was paralyzed.

I was trapped.

“No. You all stay where you are. We’re doing a scene. You!” Jeff pointed the gun at me.

I wish I could say I ducked, or ran, or even prayed, but I didn’t. I just stared.

“You’re going to be in this scene, got it? You’re eleven years old and your name is Emily. You’re smart like your dad, but you hate him.” He clucked his tongue sympathetically. “You really, *really* him. *You!*”

He pained the gun at a college student named Tyler. “Your name is Mitchell. You’re twenty-three, you’re a mentally deficient fuckup… and you hate your father.”

Tyler whimpered.

“Up!” Jeff screamed. “Onstage, right now, or I shoot her!” He trained the gun on me again and strode forward. I nearly fainted. His slick hair was thick with congealing blood and dark strings of viscera. Blood spattered his face and clothes. His shoes and the hem of his pants were soaked in it.

Tyler covered his mouth and darted to the stage.

“Now.” Jeff scanned the remaining classmates. “You, onstage.”

A woman named Abigail staggered up beside me.

“Your name is Charlotte. You’re fifty-one, you’re a fucking bitch, and you turned all your kids against your husband because you hate him.”

She uttered a small, dry sob.

Jeff pointed at a teenager named Leah, who recoiled. “You.” 

She whimpered.

Jeff snarled and charged forward. Ben tried to shield her, but Jeff shoved him out of the way. A brief scuffle ensued. I felt a wild moment of hope.

Then I heard a gunshot.

My ears rang for an instant. Then everything became curiously muffled. Ben cried out, then slumped to the floor. Jeff kicked him away and grabbed Leah. She fought and screamed. He bared his teeth and pressed the gun to her head.

“Shut up, Andrea,” he hissed. “Shut up now.”

She fell silent. Jeff dragged her on the stage. Then he tucked a lock of blood-soaked hair behind his ear and turned to the auditorium. “The scenario,” he announced, “is your typical family having a typical fight. The bitch wife left her husband months ago. Out of respect for the mother of his children, the husband stayed away. But he misses his kids. He wants to see his kids, so he came to see kids.” He pulled a grotesquely exaggerated expression. “But the bitch wife turned his kids against him. Poisoned their minds with sick lies. That’s where we are now. *That’s where we are!*” 

His voice tore through my head like a hurricane. I closed my eyes.

“Everyone clear?”

Silence, except for muffled crying and Ben’s wet, labored breathing.

“Good,” Jeff said. “Lights up.”

He bowed his head, then bounded toward Abigail. Their voices – his wheedling at first, then furious, hers only terrified – filled the auditorium. I tried to listen, but couldn’t make sense of the sounds. I tried to see, but my eyes wouldn’t focus; they kept sliding up, down, left, right. Anywhere but them.

Abigail screamed. I jerked to face her and watched, stunned, as Jeff brought the gun down on her temple. One, two, three, four, five times, until she lay dazed and mewling.

Then he sloped toward Tyler.

“Mitch, don’t cry. Don’t cry. She’s lying to you.” Tears squeezed from Jeff’s eyes. “I can prove it. I’ll prove it if you come with me. Come stay with me.”

Jeff waited, watching Tyler with an expression that made my insides shrivel.

Tyler choked. “I…I…okay. Okay, Dad. I’ll…stay.”

“No!” Jeff screamed. “You don’t stay! You come! *You come with me*!” He shoved him into the wall with such force the building seemed to shudder. “Do you even *want* to come with me?”

Tyler tried to cover his face, but Jeff peeled his hands away and roared: “You don’t! You *don’t!* You want to stay with the lying bitch, go ahead!” He threw Tyler into a corner. “Stay right here! Right here! It’s the biggest mistake you’ll ever make, you *freak!*”

Tyler slid to his knees, sobbing. Jeff cast him a contemptuous look, then set his sights on Leah. He twisted his features into an exaggerated moue of pain. “Andrea. You know she’s lying. I never hurt you. You misunderstood. You misunderstand everything, because you have no sense. So you just come with me. You want to come with me, don’t y –”

Leah bolted offstage, screaming.

“*No?*” Jeff shrieked, aiming the gun. “Then *fuck you!*”

Three deafening shots. My ears rang. Leah crumpled near the doors as my sense of hearing seemed to swallow itself. People screamed; several huddled around her.

Jeff shot into the crowd. “No! *No, no, no!*” They dropped to the floor. He stared at them, chest heaving, grey eyes glowing strangely.

Then he turned to me.

“Emily.” He tried to smile. “Em. You’re the best one. My favorite. You know that, right?”

I couldn’t move. I couldn’t think.

He shuffled forward. “You’re the best. You know they lie. You want to come live with me, right? You want to live with Daddy?”

Something clicked. I could almost feel it; my paralyzed brain lighting up and shifting sluggishly. 

“Yes,” I whispered. I cleared my throat. “Yes, Dad.”

He pulled me into a hug and kissed me. Foul, coppery, stuck to my lips. My gorge rose.

“Thank you, Em,” he whispered. “Thank you. You’re my favorite. You were always my favorite.” 

“Dad.” My voice was dry again, papery and thin. “Mitch wants to come, too. He told me. Where Mommy couldn’t hear.”

His lip curled; for a horrifying moment, I thought I’d made a fatal mistake. “No. He’s a liar, Em. He’s a mistake.”

“Yes, he might be a mistake,” I croaked, “but he wants to change and he knows you can help him.”

“Yeah?” Jeff asked.

I nodded. “It’s true. Isn’t it, Ty – Mitchell?” I glanced over my shoulder. Tyler huddled in the corner, wide-eyed and wet-faced. Desperation threatened to overwhelm me. “Right, Mitch? You don’t want to be a mistake, do you?”

To my immense relief, Tyler shook his head. “N-N-No way. I want to get better.” He looked at Jeff and flinched. “How do I get better, Dad?”

Jeff dropped my hand and strode toward Tyler. Tyler instantly recoiled. Jeff slapped him. “Man up.”

Tyler nodded as tears spilled down his cheeks. “Sorry, Dad. You know how I am. That’s why I need y-your help, you know?”

“Yeah,” Jeff said. “I know.” He watched Tyler for an agonizing moment.

Then he dragged him to his feet. Tyler wailed. Jeff slapped him again. “Shut the fuck up. You want to get better?”

“Yes,” Tyler wheezed. “Yes, Dad, I want to get better because –”

“Then prove it.” Jeff forced him over to Abigail’s prone body. Blood sheeted over her face. Unfocused eyes drifted between Jeff and Tyler.

Jeff pressed the gun into Tyler’s hand. “Prove it,” he repeated, and stepped back.

Tyler stared at the gun.

“Prove it!” Jeff screamed.

“Dad,” I whispered. “He’s just a little scared. He makes mistakes. He needs help. You should let me help him.”

“No,” Jeff said. “He’s got to prove himself, Emily.”

An epiphany dawned. Suddenly I knew what to say, knew what to do – but would Tyler understand?

“He makes mistakes,” I repeated. “But you made one, too.”

“I don’t make mistakes!” Jeff roared.

“But you did! You gave Mitchell the gun, didn’t you?”

Tyler spun around. Jeff’s face contorted. “No!” he breathed. “Don’t you *dare*!”

Tyler dared.

The bullet tore through Jeff’s head and hit the light panel. Sparks exploded across the muslin curtain. I saw a flare and a flicker, and suddenly the curtain was on fire. 

Everyone converged on the exit. I ran blindly, dimly aware that someone was carrying Leah, and others were supporting Ben. We formed a desperate scrum at the door, barely managing to keep ourselves in check. But we did.

The aftermath is a still a blur.

Ben, Leah, and Abigail survived. Jeff did not; Tyler’s aim had been preternaturally true. I found out later that he was a target shooter; he and his mom went to the range every weekend. Talk about luck.

I learned that Jeff killed his wife and children a few hours before recreating it at improv group. My friend Em was his daughter. I hadn’t known. I suppose it wouldn’t have made a difference either way.

I haven’t done improv since. I still remember the rules, though.

I think I’ll always remember the rules.

“Oh no, no, no.” I mumbled to myself as I turned to face away from the room full of werewolves, seeing as apparently, [I was a vampire now.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/xk8feu/the_heat_suck_the_frat_house_from_hell/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

“Danny, are you alright?” [Ashton](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/xixlfc/the_heat_suck_survive_the_night/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) asked, concerned.

I forced myself to get up,“ [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/vr18oq/the_heat_suck/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) can’t be happening!”

“What can’t be happening? Danny, turn around and talk to us!” 

Fear kept me from turning around to face them, but the sound of their blood rushing through their veins made my stomach grumble. Ooh I was hungry. So, so hungry. I turned around.

“Oi! What the hell?” Ashton yelled, taking a step back in surprise. Some other pack members followed.

“He’s a vamp, now?” One of them asked, confused. (Me too buddy, me too.)

I backed myself up all the way as far as I could, concerned for both my safety and theirs.

Another frat bro took a step closer to me out of curiosity. Like some deep primal instinct, I bared my fangs and hissed at him. The frat bro jumped back.

“What the fuck?” I yelped out, covering my mouth. My eyes were so wide from surprise, it felt like they might burst out of their sockets. 

Ashton took a cautious step towards me and I did it again. He cringed at the action. I did the same. 

“I-I’m not trying to do this! Make it stoooop, please!” 

Suddenly another shockwave of intense pain flooded through my body, knocking me to my knees. I cried out in pain as I clutched my stomach, like that would do something. My mouth was dry and my tongue started to swell. It felt like the fiery depths of hell decided to take up residence in my throat, and the hunger… My god the hunger, and the pain it brought with it. I wanted to drop dead at that very moment. The battle between my mental and physical will from restraining myself from going after the kids surrounding me was becoming exhausting. I felt myself slipping and couldn’t resist the temptation for much longer, and that scared the shit out of me.

I let out a guttural grunt as my new instinct started to take control. I was going to pounce.

Suddenly, a bark came from upstairs and Butter, the golden retriever, came barreling down the stairs. She started barking and growling angrily at me once she reached us. I hissed and bared my fangs back which caused her to bark and growl even more. Eventually I had enough of it. 

“Butter No!” Ashton screamed.

One second I was backed into a corner, the next I was sucking the blood out of poor Butter’s throat. Nothing else mattered as the delectably sweet and salty liquid slid down my throat. The instant Butter’s blood hit my stomach, the raging fire within cooled and my hunger diminished greatly. 

When I was finished with my meal, exhaustion quickly set in and I became very sleepy. I stumbled back into my corner, but before my consciousness fully faded out I heard Ashton say something along the lines of,” We need to call Marcy.” 

***

I woke up after a large jolt launched me in the air and I landed on the padded pleather seats in the back of  Ashton’s car. The vehicle had just gone over a speed bump. An uncomfortable burning sensation engulfed my wrists, which I found were bound behind my back.

Why the hell am I always blacking out and losing consciousness?

“Rise n’ shine Sammy!” Ashton yelled enthusiastically from the driver's seat.

“Who?” I asked, sitting myself up. Someone had thankfully put clothes on me.

“Never mind.” 

A glance in the rear view mirror showed there was no blood on my face. 

“Washed you down with the hose.” Ashton answered, like he read my mind.

“Sorry about Butter.” I mumbled as what sounded like handcuffs rubbed tightly against my bare skin. Ashton didn’t say anything, just brooded for a minute.

The tension between us in the car quickly rose to a crescendo and Ashton finally broke it. “They’re silver handcuffs. Both vampires and wolves have an allergy to them.” 

“I can feel that, thanks.” I pressed my lips into a thin line and mentally flipped him off.

“It was for all of our protection.”

“Hey,” I said defensively, I would’ve put my hands up in a defensive gesture but you know… “I totally get it dude.”

More silence. Ashton then turned on the radio station. Some garbage country song was playing.

“Ugh. Country.” We said in unison. Some of the tension between us melted away after that and he turned the radio to a random rock station. 

“Where are we going?” I finally asked.

“To a meeting with the vampire council.” Ashton said in a sigh. He noticed my look of confusion. “They’re the ones in charge of the vampire clan that turned your friends… and you too I guess.”

“I don’t understand. I thought you bit me and turned me into a werewolf.”

“I did. To be totally honest with you, Danny, I’ve never seen anything like this. Hence why we’re going to meet up with those soul sucking vampires.”

“Vampires suck blood not souls.” I corrected.

“Jesus Danny, not literally. Once you meet them you’ll understand.” 

I sucked my tongue behind my teeth then turned to look at the blurry scenery rushing by. Not too long later, Ashton pulled into the parking lot of this large decrepit warehouse. “We’re here.”

He got out and then pulled me out of the car, making sure he had a hand on my bound arms behind me.

“You’re not going to run, are you?”

“Why would I run? One, I have no clue where we even are right now, and two, I want answers just as much as you do.” He then released his grip on my arms. I flinched to pretend I was going to make a run for it and Ashton didn’t like this since his eyes lit up like lightbulbs- literally they started glowing yellow. 

“Calm down, it was just a joke.” I reassured him.

“Ha. Ha. So funny Danny!” He said in a mocking and unimpressed voice.

“Damn right, I’m hilarious.” I grumbled to myself as I followed him into the creepy looking warehouse.

Our footsteps echoed through the building as Ashton led me to wherever it was he was taking me. 

My heart fell into my stomach when I saw two, freshly dead, familiar faces. It was Beck and Jess. 
Something about seeing them after all of the trauma I’d experienced and gone through the past few days made something inside me… snap. Almost like something deep inside me took control.

“You!” I yelled, all my emotions bubbling out all at once. I lunged towards the pair, more specifically towards Jessica for some reason. If I had to guess, probably because she’s the one that turned me. 

My attempt at attack was fruitless as a sudden and intense electrical shock came from my rib cage. I knew that feeling all too well from back when Beck got us arrested and tazed. The shockwave caused my muscles to tense and I landed, hard, on the cold concrete floor with a loud thud. 

“And that folks, is why I always carry a taser.” An unfamiliar female voice said as the last of the shock exited my system. I turned to see a tall dirty blonde with extremely wavy hair and the deepest shade of red lipstick I’ve ever seen blow into the prongs of the taser she’d just used on me. Kinda like a cowboy does in those old western movies after they’ve just shot their gun and won a duel. 

“Was that really necessary?” Ashton asked, annoyed,” his hands are bound.” 

“I saw his eyes, Ash, they were yellow. Besides, what good would those cuffs do if he got his snout on my new girl, huh? What you should do is put a muzzle on the mutt.”

“Hurtful.” I stated.

“That’s enough. He just doesn’t have control over his wolf yet.” Ashton said, kind of defending me? 

“You’re in my safe house, remember that. And if what you’re saying is true, then he’s still one of mine, and I can do what I please with him.”

Ashton put his hands up defensively and backed away. 

“Does somebody wanna help me up here? This ground is nasty. I promise I won’t bite your head off or anything.” I asked, spitting some dirt out of my mouth. I think a silverfish crawled in my mouth.

Ashton huffed before he helped pick me up. If my hands were cuffed, I’d have wiped the dust and dirt off my clothes.

“Let’s get this meeting started then, shall we?” The hot blonde vampire chick stated as she tucked the taser back into her pocket. She was wearing a black pencil shirt with a tucked in white button up blouse under a dark navy blue pantsuit jacket. Ashton was wearing a hoodie and jeans and I had on another plain white t-shirt and jeans as well. 

“Where’s the rest of the council, Marcy?” Ashton asked, confused.

“Where’s your council?” She sarcastically countered. 
 
Ashton rolled his eyes,” I’m the Alpha. I am the council.” 

“Really? He looks so young though.” Jess said, surprised. 

“Him, yes,” the supposed Marcy said, addressing her pupil,” Me? Not so much. I’ve been around for a crisp one hundred and fifty years. One hundred and fifty-one next April.”

“Cut the shit Marcy. Where are they?” 

“Ugh, you’re no fun Ash! I had to… terminate them. They got greedy and started abducting and draining more humans than they were allowed, instead of keeping their stock alive and drinking from them when necessary. All these new fledglings are fucking greedy as hell too.” She then side eyed Beck and Jessica. 

“So it’s just us two then? Good.”

“Why? Scared we’d gang up on you?” Marcy said with a fake pout.

“There’s a reason why I’m the Alpha, and why your ass is the head of the vampire council.” Ashton retorted, almost threateningly.

“Yeah, whatever.” Marcy said, returning Ashton’s annoyed expression from earlier. Marcy then suddenly clapped her hands. “Okay kiddies, why don’t you wait here and catch up while the grown-ups talk in the other room!” 

“Um, I’m probably older than him.” I said, gesturing to Ashton.

“Probably not. I’ve been the Sigma Beta Theta fraternity president for the last fifty years.” 

I looked at him inquisitively. He shrugged his shoulders. “Vampires aren’t the only species with extended lifetimes, plus all the money lining Paloma University's pockets keeps them from asking too many questions.” 

With that the two exited the room to talk elsewhere and they went very far to where our super hearing couldn’t listen in on their conversation.

Beck and Jessica made their way to an old dusty futon. I shuffled my way over to a semi-comfortable looking La-Z-Boy. 

Seriously I’ve had enough of these long pauses of awkward silence and rise in tension. It’s bad enough I have social anxiety, now I have to deal with being some sort of werewolf/vampire Jekyll and Hyde type shit. 

Beck was picking his fingers and Jess was twiddling with her thumbs. I could practically see her debating going on her phone through her facial features to ease her anxiety. Knowing her though, she didn’t want to be rude. 

“I-I’m sorry for trying to kill you.” I said aloud to the air, to nobody in particular. It was just to ease some of the tension, really. 

“We’re sorry for trying to kill you too.” Jess and Beck said at the same time, practically jumping off the futon. 

“This shit sucks.” I said, sniffing, trying to hold back my tears. 

“Yeah, it does.” Beck stated. 

“I can’t believe you’re a werewolf.” Jess said, looking me over. “I thought you’d be more ripped.”

“I can’t believe you’re vampires. And technically I’m one too.” I said back, deciding to tune out that last part Jess said.

“Yeah, about that…” Jess started.

Beck finished, “Remember when we were making fun of that pig, Bailey? Well he and Bradshaw got an idea and went to Marcy with it. They thought that it would be a lot easier to get us younger-  good looking- folk to lure people from bars and clubs and stuff back to the nest so we could feed off of them, instead of taking people by force. Marcy approved and gave them the go-ahead to turn us.” 

“Fucking pigs, man.” I muttered.

“Yeah, the heat suck!” Beck added on.

Jess scoffed,“ Literally.”

“You guys have been back to the apartment, I see.” I said, trying to keep the small talk flowing.

Beck had on a white t-shirt with a black smiley face graphic on it over a black and white striped long sleeve shirt. He had some acid wash jeans on as well as a black Carrhart beanie. Jessica had some tight black leggings with a fuzzy pink Sherpa jacket on. Her long blonde hair was pulled into a messy bun.

“Yup.” Jess said, her lips making a pop sound after the p. 

“If the frat bros hadn’t forced me to stay with them I didn’t know where I’d go. I didn’t think the apartment was safe.” 

“Yeah, we probably would’ve killed you, especially after finding out you were a werewolf.” Beck admitted. “It’s like the species are biologically enemies for some reason.” 

I pressed my lips into a line and nodded my head in agreement, glad my werewolf self hadn’t gone back to the apartment for some reason. Jess also agreed. 

“Sorry.” She said.

“No, no, I get it.” I said, thinking if I were in the same situation that’s exactly what I’d do too. 

I was startled when a sudden buzz came from my back pocket. I didn’t realize my phone was on me. 

It was work, of all people, texting me. They were concerned because they hadn’t seen me the past two days. I told them where I’ve been and where I was, lying obviously, just generally letting them know I was ok and wouldn’t know when I’d be back. 

I left it at that seeing as Ashton and Marcy returned.

“What’s the verdict?” I asked, getting up out of the La-Z-Boy nervously.

“Well, you’re a hybrid, that part is glaringly obvious.” Ashton said, rubbing the bridge of his nose.

Marcy continued,“But, hybrids are rare and mostly die right after being turned.” 

“So, I’m going to die?”

“Oh, most likely.” Marcy laughed out. Ashton glared at her. “But, we think the only reason you’re still alive is because of the recent full moon.”

“Elaborate, please?” I asked, confused and quite frankly caught up on the fact that I might die very soon.

“Basically we think the two species are fighting for dominance inside you.” Ashton explained. “The werewolf in you was dominant and your wolf was brought to the forefront because of the moon’s effects on us. Now that it’s over, the vampire’s hunger brought that part of you out. What we want to do is try to make one part of you constant, essentially trying to purge the other side of you out. Whichever one wins is the side you go with.”

“How do you plan to do that?”

Marcy perked up,” Torture!” 

“Wait what?” Jess yelled. 

“Sorry, Danny.” Was all Ashton had to say.

I barely had time to process what was happening when Marcy then lunged at me and tazed me again in the ribs. She tazed me some more, in the ribs and on my face and neck, until I blacked out from the pain. 

***

I woke up in the most uncomfortable position. My wrists were bound above my head by silver cuffs and my body was somewhat suspended up in the air- like one or two inches. The room was dark, cold, and wet with no windows. There was a chair in front of me and a little table with one of those surgical trays on top, filled with scalpels, sharp looking toothpicks, and some other horrors I don’t even want to describe.

Again, I’m not good with gore and stuff. Just thinking of what was about to happen to me was enough to make me gag.

I heard a pair of footsteps quickly approaching the door to my torture room. My heart started to race and my palms grew sweaty at the thought of what was about to be done to me. Either I was going to die because I’m a hybrid or I was going to die by being tortured to death, great.

I pulled on my wrists as hard as I could to try and escape, but no dice. This was really happening.

The door slowly creaked open.

Fate is a cruel mistress and her name is Marcy. 

“Oh, I bet you’re soooo wet right now.” I scoffed as Officer Bailey moseyed on in, right up to the surgical tray. 

“Indeed I am. This is going to be quite fun. It’s not everyday one of my victims escapes, so think of this as payback.” He said calmly, though the undertones of excitement were prevalent in his words. He picked up some scalpels and examined them thoughtfully.

“So, fun.” I said unenthusiastically. 

“Now, let's see what monster is present!” Bailey said, picking up a toothpick. 

A sharp jabbing pain came from my lower right side. I yelped out in pain. 

“Vampire it is.” Bailey said menacingly after getting a good look at my eyes. 

I don’t know how long I was in there, but it felt like an eternity. The worst part was, the only time I actually wanted to get knocked out, my body forcefully kept me awake. 

When I was a vampire, Bailey would stick a bunch of tiny toothpicks wherever he pleased around my body, like some kind of demented acupuncture. He also has this little cooler full of blood bags and would open them up in front of me and waft it under my nose, bringing out my hunger pains. The sick bastard would then take a break and guzzle it down right in front of me. He knew the hunger pains were the worst thing for a vampire to experience and used it to his advantage.

When I was a werewolf, he’d play scientist and cut me all over with his silver scalpel. The wounds would heal over, just not as fast as they normally would. He’d specifically wait until one had just closed up before cutting it right back open again. There was this purple wolfsbane powder he’d shake in front of my nose, or even blow it into my face, effectively causing me to have an asthma attack. Sort of like dry waterboarding. My favorite part was when he would shoot me with silver BB gun pellets. At one point he graduated to actual silver bullets and aimed for the non lethal area’s. 

What really did me in though, was the holy water. Yeah he actually waterboarded me with the stuff. It felt like acid was being poured down my gullet. I felt my tongue and throat dissolve only to regenerate and dissolve again. Time and time again, over and over. If I actually did survive this, Bailey was first on my hit list. 

At one point, Bailey left the room and had been gone longer than all his other short breaks. When he came back he had two giant fifteen gallon buckets full of holy water. He grabbed a ladder and just dumped the stuff over my head. It felt like I was being showered in lava. Parts of my skin burned and melted off, but he made sure that my bound hands weren’t affected, causing me to be able to slip out of my restraints. I could hear my skin sizzling away and just remember wanting the suffering to be over. The pain was so terrible. 

I was finally granted peace after the second bucket of holy water was dumped on me. 

Everything faded to black and I couldn’t see, hear, or feel anything. I was just sitting there in an empty void.

“Am I dead?” I asked myself. I was shocked when I actually heard my echoey voice.

“Unfortunately, no.” Another voice said from behind me. I spun around to put a face to the oddly familiar voice. 

I was surprised when I came face to face with… me.

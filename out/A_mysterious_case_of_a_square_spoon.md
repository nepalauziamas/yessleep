There is a square spoon in the utensil drawer. I picked it up and examined it. The end of he handle was  square, and the tip of the spoon was also slightly square. I frowned at it, wondering where it came from before putting it back and pulling out another spoon. I stuck it in my bowl of cereal and walked back up to my room.

There are more of them. I don't know where they are coming from. There used to be just one, but now  half of the spoons are replaced with these square spoons. I refuse to eat with them. I don't like them, they exude and air of... uneasiness. I haven't said anything yet in case this is some weird prank my sister is pulling on me.

All the spoons are replaced now. We were sitting down for dinner, Mom had made a stew.  The table was set with forks and the square spoons. I served myself a bowl of stew, and then hesitantly picked up the square spoon. I examined it, turning it over in the light. The edges seemed more square than the first one that I had seen. My reflection is oddly warped in the bowl of the spoon. I don't like it.

"Did we get new spoons?" I asked my mom.

"No, these are the same ones we've had for five years." she replied

I muttered before lowering the spoon to my bowl and scooping up a bite. I was feeling... not right. I stared at the spoon full of stew. *Moms stew is delicious,* I thought to myself *why am I worried?* I raised the spoon to my mouth. Almost immediately I spat it out. It tasted disgusting, like rotting meat and dirty water. "What's wrong?" my Mom asked while I sat there coughing. "I think I don't feel well." I said, staring down at the imposter spoon. I started to get up to get up to go to my room, but first I had a thought. I picked up my fork and dipped it into the bowl of stew. I licked the tines, and it tasted fine. I  glared at the square spoon, before continuing up to my room.

I managed to find a regular spoon. It was in the back of the dishwasher, where it had apparently fallen out during a load. I used it to eat everything that need a spoon. I hand washed it after using it and I kept it on my bedside table. But now... its gone. I woke up this morning to find my spoon was replaced with one of the square spoons. The edges were sharp and pointed, no longer rounded. Frustrated, I threw the spoon and it bounced against the wall and fell to the floor.

I went out and bought a new set of spoons to use. I was so happy to have a regular spoon, and to eat food that didn't tase rotten. This morning I found one of the square spoons amongst the regular spoons. I didn't think much of it, and put the square spoon with the rest of them. I just got back from school and all of the spoons that I had bought are square.

I went to go buy more regular spoons, and now they are on sale. Almost every spoon in the kitchen utility store is square. Everything about it is wrong. I asked about them, but no one seems to think anything is wrong. I showed one of the workers the square spoons and she said there's nothing wrong with them. I bought a five pack of regular spoons and left. I have decided to keep one with me at all times.

I get uneasy just looking at the square spoons now. Just being near one I start to get nauseous like I just smelled something rotten.  I've started seeing the spoons more often now. They are on sale at the general grocery store. My high-school cafeteria has cheap plastic versions. They are even replacing forks. I looked in the utensil drawer in the kitchen and most of the forks are replaced with the square spoons. 

There everywhere now. I found one inside my backpack, and one on my bedside table. I cant find any normal spoons anymore, it just the square spoons. Just my little regular, normal, not square spoon is left. I have a constant sense of uneasiness. Like a impending sense of doom.

This morning I woke up to find that my spoon, what had been the only normal spoon left on earth is square. I sat staring in disbelief at the spoon that had betrayed me. That's it. No more spoons. The uneasiness is gone. I didn't eat anything today until dinner. Mom had made stew again. I sat down at the table with my square spoon. I dipped the square spoon into the bowl of stew in front of me, served from a square spoon. I lifted the spoon to my mouth and...

It was delicious.

About a month ago I got lost while hiking in the desert. I know, it’s embarrassing, but please hear me out. I’m typically really careful but this time a wicked sandstorm took me by surprise. I’ve never been caught out like that and I wasn’t prepared for how the sand tore at my exposed skin. So I ran until I could find some cover. When it finally subsided, I had no idea where I was. My tracks were swept away and I wasn’t sure which direction I had been running.

It shouldn’t have been that hard to find my way back but I just kept getting turned around. I tried to follow my compass, but I wandered all day without coming across any familiar landmarks. The sun beat down on me terribly and I quickly went through my water. Just when I thought I couldn’t go on any further, I saw a camp in the distance. I knew it was probably a mirage but I had no other choice.

Much to my relief the tent didn't disappear as I got closer and, amazingly, it seemed like it was pitched right beside an oasis. Ecstatic, I used what little energy I had left to run the last hundred yards. I dropped to my knees by the water, scooping up a massive handful that I pressed my face directly into. I had never been so thirsty in my life and it tasted like heaven. Without even looking for its occupant I crawled into the tent and immediately passed out.

It wasn’t until I woke up the next morning that I realized I wasn’t alone. I opened my eyes and nearly screamed. Staring back at me from the corner was a completely desiccated body. It looked like it had been in the sun for years. As I scrambled up to get away, something caught my eye. Clutched in one of the shriveled hands was a leather-bound journal. For some reason I snatched it as I ran out of the tent and back into the desert.

Everything that follows is from that journal. I know I should have given it to the rangers who found me later that day, but something compelled me to keep and read it. I wanted to know what happened to him. It was a stupid decision. Because now I’m worried what might happen to me.

I

A fractured skull, eight broken ribs, right arm and leg snapped in two places.

Christ.

I went to the Appalachian Trail trying to add meaning into my life and I didn’t even make it out of the state. Everyone begged me not to go but I just wouldn’t listen. It’s just some walking and camping, right? How hard could it be?

What an idiot.

No one is really sure how long I was lying in that ravine. I left on a Tuesday and meant to call my friend from a rest stop about a week later. When I didn’t, he called the police. They searched for two days before they found me. It’s no small miracle that I was alive and an even larger one that I woke up a month later. The prognosis had been grim, they told me, but I surprised them all.

Everyday I try to remember what happened to me out there. There’s nothing but a gap between my first night camping and waking up in the hospital. Which is why, six months into my recovery, my doctor has asked me to start this journal. It can help me deal with the trauma and prevent the regression of cognitive abilities. Her words, not mine. But if it will help stave off brain damage I’m all for it.

I have to answer a lot of questions these days. Doctors, sure, but also friends and family. They all want to know about the coma. What did it feel like? Did you see God? Stuff like that. I can’t blame them. Some people have never met someone who very nearly died. They’re searching, the same as I was when I left for my trip, for an answer to it all. And I wish I could give them that. I wish I could say I heard their comforting words, felt them holding my hand. I want to tell them that I met the big guy and he promised me I would be okay. 

But there was none of that.

The truth is that it was little more than nothing at all. Just me, floating in an inky black, distant whispers swirling just out of earshot.

Getting past that feeling has been the hardest part of this process. I’m healing nicely, and I can walk again, but I just can’t shake it. Like a part of me is still there, adrift in my own mind. It makes me feel crazy to even say. My psychiatrist says not to worry, it’s a normal response to the level of trauma I experienced.

I’m hoping he’s right.

I’ve started to dream again.

They tell me it’s a good sign. It means my brain is using less resources to repair the damage and freeing up enough for me to dream. They’re mostly pleasant, too, which is nice. And even when they’re not it’s still a welcome change. Until now sleep has just been a return to the almost-nothing.

Last night I dreamt of the clearest lake you’ve ever seen. Looking down I could watch the fish as they milled about near the bottom. They went about their lives, completely oblivious to my presence. How easy it would be, I thought, to catch one if I had my pole. The glassy stillness was broken only by the ripples set off as dragonflies darted around, either chasing prey or desperately trying to escape the heat of the midday sun.

I slipped off my shoes and sat on the shore to let the water lap over my feet. The whole scene was so peaceful I felt as if I could fall into a second, deeper sleep. After some time, I was suddenly struck by an eerie stillness. The birdsong that had drifted on the breeze moments before had vanished. From the trees behind, just beyond recognition, was a faint whisper. I turned to focus, trying to make out what was being said. Something grabbed my leg.

I woke up thirsty.

This isn’t new. In the month since they sent me home I’ve probably doubled my water bill from drinking alone. When I go out to dinner the server inevitably leaves a pitcher for me rather than revisit the table over and over. I’ve talked to my doctor about it, but she doesn’t seem concerned. According to her, people in extreme survival situations often crave water for months after they’re rescued. I guess if she’s not worried I shouldn’t be either.

After an uneventful day of working from home I went to physical therapy. I usually like physical therapy. It makes it easier to see the improvements that I’m making. The session this week was particularly intense, so I was incredibly sweaty by the end of it. Luckily they have a shower on the premises that patients can use. I decided to take advantage so as to not track it into my car.

I spent a long time in the shower letting the hot water relax my already sore muscles. The mirror had completely fogged by the time I got out. I stood there for a moment examining my blurry form. I felt slightly envious. The person obscured by the steam didn’t share the surgical scars that now cover my body. I thought about how, if I could go back, I would have listened to everyone asking me not to take the trip. I would have found another way to deal with the fact that I felt like I lacked purpose. But I didn’t do that, and so now I look like this.

I smirked at my own vanity while drying my face. As I lowered the towel I froze. Something towered behind me in the mirror, arms raised, spidery fingers spread as if pressed against the glass. After a moment of panic, I quickly wiped the steam from the mirror.

It was gone.

I was still wet as I got hastily dressed. I spoke with the staff and they said no one else was in the locker room at the time. I know it could have been a trick of the eyes. The room has those fluorescent tubes that sometimes flicker and light unevenly. But it felt real enough that I’m concerned. I’m meeting with my psychiatrist tomorrow.

Writing this now, I’m thankful the figure had been blurred by the steam. The size and shape of it were frightening enough. If I dream again tonight, I hope that thing isn’t in them.

I told my psychiatrist about the incident at my appointment the next day. Going in I was nervous that he wouldn’t believe me. Or worse, that he would tell me I was losing my mind. But he simply listened for a while, nodding along as I explained exactly what I saw. Toward the end of our session, after confirming that I had no family history of psychosis, he called my doctor. Given my recent head injury, we all agreed that an MRI was probably the right next step.

Unfortunately, after reviewing the images, my physician could find no abnormalities. A bit of scarring, of course, from the accident. But nothing in an area that would cause any type of hallucinations. At the time it was chalked up to the stress of returning to work, but she told me to definitely let her know if I experienced any other episodes.

Immediately after my hospital visit I met a friend for dinner. He told me about the trip he was going on with his wife later in the month. Some beachside getaway they had been putting off until I had fully recovered. I appreciated that he had been so present during this difficult experience, and I told him so. I trust him more than anyone else, so I also recounted the events of the previous night.

He seemed slightly concerned, but mostly he helped me to laugh it off. He joked that it was bad enough having to see me in the hospital, he simply wouldn’t come visit me in the psych ward. I chuckled as I absentmindedly reached for my customary pitcher. Just as the water began to flow into my glass, something caught my eye. I gasped and instinctively let go of the pitcher. The creature reflected inside vanished as it smashed against the floor.

When I’ve been able to sleep, my dreams have been about the accident. I’m not sure if I’m starting to remember what happened or just fabricating things. But it’s always the same. I step on a rock along the trail and it gives way. I try to catch myself, but the branch I grab snaps off in my hand, and I tumble into the ravine. I black out. When I come to I’m lying, broken and battered, at the edge of a spring. I’m wracked with thirst. I crawl, wincing, to the water and drink deeply. The thing is there, staring back at me from the surface. I wake up.

I’ve spoken to the authorities that conducted the search and they’ve assured me there was no spring within miles of where they found me. I believe them, of course, but everything about the dream feels so real. And if I’m making it up, why is it always exactly the same? 

It’s been a week now since I first saw that figure staring at me in the mirror. And now I’ve seen it in earnest.

I used to love the rain. Sitting and watching as the drops streaked across the windows, tracing lines in a warm orange cast by the streetlight opposite my home. So when it started to rain two nights ago I went to peer out into the dark. Maybe if I hadn’t, it wouldn’t have known I was here. Maybe it would have continued on to torment someone else.

But I did, and I saw it, and it saw me.

It stood almost motionless that first night, rain collecting in the twisted vines of its construction before spilling over in small, dark waterfalls. I might have mistaken it for a statue if not for the occasional rippling of tendrils, like the muscles of a predator lying in wait. I watched until sleep finally took over in the early morning. When I awoke the rain had stopped, and the creature had vanished.

Last night only produced a brief drizzle and, though it filled me with dread, the creature didn’t reappear. But it’s storming now, and I’ve been without power for hours. I don’t need to look to know it’s come back. My house shakes with the groaning of an entire forest straining in the wind. Flashes of lightning cast vicious shadows on the walls, ever moving as it circles, looking for a way to me.

The thing is as unrelenting as it is terrible. At times the sound dwindles, offering a moment of respite. Then the snapping of branches, loud as peals of thunder, tell me it has resumed the hunt. I’ve given up hoping this is a nightmare. I know this is not the fabrication of a damaged brain. Somehow, this is happening, and I’m afraid it will never end.

I just heard glass shatter somewhere. It’s inside.

In the 16th century Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León sailed to Florida. His goal, a secret at the time, was to locate the Fountain of Youth. The official history says this mission was never accomplished. Allegedly, the conquistador would be wounded by a poisoned arrow in combat and die shortly after. What the more obscure records say is that in his final days Ponce de León refused any offer of water. What I believe is that he found it, somewhere just at the edges of reality. And I think I found it too.

That night the thing had entered my home on the ground floor. When I heard the window break I instinctively grabbed my shotgun from the closet and rushed downstairs. I found it clawing its way through the now empty frame above my kitchen sink. I fired once, trying to slow its entry. But the thing didn’t flinch. The shot merely sent shards of wood flying in all directions, opening a wound that dripped a foul black. It tore at the walls until it found purchase on the sink itself.

In one motion the creature ripped it from its place ushering a geyser of water from the now severed pipes. That was all it needed. Before I could react it burst through the weakened wall and lunged at me. Its razor-like tendrils tore into my arm, cutting nearly to the bone. I leapt backwards and levied another shot into the things chest. This time it shrieked, long strands of viscous fluid flying from its jagged maw. It swung for me again but I was gone. I ran up the stairs as quickly as I could.

I barricaded the door to my room and listened as it thrashed around, growing ever closer to the stairs. And then it stopped. I waited for some time, listening for any hint at whether it still remained. When I heard nothing I grabbed my box of shells and slowly made my way to the top of the stairs. My heart pounded in my throat so loud that it could surely hear the blood rushing in my ears. The water from the broken pipes had pooled at the bottom. And there it stood, like some great mangrove given form by malice, claws digging into the wood more than halfway up the stairwell.

Over the next few hours I sat, back against the wall, firing the occasional blast into the beast. I knew it was pointless but there was some small sense of calm that came from seeing pieces rent from it. The rising water on the floor ran black with whatever vile substance gave it life. As each new step became submerged it would lumber closer, grasping at but never quite reaching me.

At some point I suddenly became aware that it had stopped raining. I knew it was my only chance. I packed what I could, climbed out my bedroom window, and I ran, leaving that thing behind in my flooded home. When I felt safe, I called a cab, took it to the airport, and got on the next flight to the desert.

I’ve seen it a few times since I’ve been here, but only ever at a distance. Standing in some fountain outside of a business or peering at me from the water bottle of one of my colleagues. Personally, I’ve learned to live without water. I drink soda and juice, even though I’m always thirsty. I held down a job for a while but after I refused to bathe they finally let me go. Dry shampoo only goes so far. I was never able to find another job so I ended up getting evicted. 

If I wasn’t going to have the amenities of a home, I didn’t want to be anywhere that I might see it. So I’ve set up camp, illegally of course, in the national park. I’d feel safer if I was indoors somewhere, but camping out here isn’t the worst. At least it doesn’t…

Oh god… It’s starting to rain…

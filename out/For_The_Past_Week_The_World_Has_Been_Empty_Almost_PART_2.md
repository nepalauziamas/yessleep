[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/xntuo0/for_the_past_week_the_world_has_been_emptyalmost/)

Hi again. The Internet has been working consistently again, so I figured I'd write this now.

A lot has happened. Thanks for all the comments and ideas. Sorry, I couldn't get back to you, the internet seems to flicker on and off... wherever I am. But now I know two things.

1. There is nobody else out here

How? Because I took your advice. I grabbed my bike and filled a backpack full of pantry foods and the gun my dad hid on the top shelf of his closet. I rode until I came to what I thought was the end of this place.

Have you ever heard of Minecraft's Farlands?

Well, that's what I named this place. Because it looks very similar. When I looked closely, I could see cars and stoplights, and other random objects mixed into the floating mounds of dirt, stone, and grass.

I thought I could find an opening at the bottom, but I was wrong. I spent hours looking for any crevice I could fit through, but I turned up empty. Defeated, I biked back down the lonely highways and silent fields that led me there.

2. There are more of them in here.

I couldn't make the trip back from the Farlands, because, just like in Minecraft, it's very far from home. So I decided to hole up in the first place I found. That turned out to be a Lowe's. There were displays inside that I could use as a makeshift bed, which would be nice since I haven't had much sleep since I came here.

I got some candy bars and soda and settled down on a couch placed next to a fire pit with a few lounge chairs. I soon drifted off to sleep, but that didn't last long. A loud crash that echoed throughout the warehouse jolted me out of some nightmare about being trapped in a ring of fire that was growing closer to me.

I looked around the store to see where the sound came from when I heard another crash in the kitchen appliances section. I ran there to find a refrigerator toppled over with a trail of blood leading to the end of another aisle. More blood than I'd ever seen in my life.

I reluctantly followed the trail. I don't know why in hindsight. Some mixture of curiosity and horror, probably. Well, what I found at the end wasn't pretty.

I would describe the creature's face, but its head was nonexistent, just a stub that was spraying a little fountain of blood onto a tattered Lowe's uniform. In its hands, it gripped a rusty chainsaw that looked to have been cutting anything besides wood lately.

I doubt it would have known I was standing there if I hadn't slipped on a pool of blood and knocked over a cardboard display full of hedge clippers. As soon as they clattered to the ground, the thing whipped around and revved its chainsaw to life with a screech that sounded like the crying of lost souls.

I tried to get up again but slipped and fell on my stomach, knocking the wind out of me. I turned to see the thing approaching with a limp, chainsaw chugging ominously.

I got up successfully this time and ran down the aisle, turning into another hallway, and I almost got cleaved in half when the blade of the chainsaw came sweeping at my stomach. I jumped back and landed on my ass, scrambling to my feet and seeing for the first time the rack of axes to my right.

I yanked one out and stripped off the plastic safety edge. This time, it was me who charged, a dumb move considering the circumstances, but since the chainsaw was heavier than my axe, I was able to hit the blade's side and knock it into the shelf next to us, sending sparks flying.

I swung the axe down on the outstretched arm holding the handle and cleaved it apart in a shower of blood and bone fragments. It struggled to heft the chainsaw with one arm, and I took the advantage to go for the legs this time, breaking its shin and making the creature fall down.

I took advantage and swung the axe until the chainsaw thing wasn't twitching anymore. Tired and covered in blood, I collapsed on the floor.

When I woke up, the body of the thing with the chainsaw was gone, and so was all the blood that was spilled. I retrieved my backpack, chastising myself for not bringing the gun with me.

The sun was peeking over the hills, and I set off on my bike, my confidence rising a bit. I killed one of these things. I was glad to know that they could even be killed.

Eventually, I reached home. I came to the realization that even though I HAD killed one of these monsters, I had gotten lucky. It almost sounded like plot armor to have a rack of axes right next to me.

I knew there had to be some way out. And The Farlands were the only place I could think to look. After taking a rest and eating a bit, I decided I would try to get back while the sun was still in the sky. So I got back on my bike and made the long journey back.

When I got to the wall, I noticed it looked different from the last time I saw it. I realized after watching it for a while that it shifted. It was as slow as clouds move, but little by little, the wall was moving to the right. Eventually, I saw a thin crag between a floating mound and one that faced out of the ground, just wide enough for my bike to fit through.

After a while of riding through a damp muddy cave, I began to see light at the end of the tunnel. But when I emerged, I wanted to break down.

Picture this: A seemingly never-ending expanse of dead grass with buildings, cars, and other items scattered over the plains. I could see creatures of all different shapes and sizes wandering the wasteland.

This, I realized, is where they come from.

I wanted to run into the arms of one of them right there and then, I wanted to give up on wherever this godforsaken place existed. But I didn't.

That one instinct, that one part of me that made my legs move when faced with The Grimm, the part of me that allowed me to chop the Chainsaw Employee to pieces, wouldn't let me give up here. But I wasn't going out into that place. Instead, I solemnly got back on my bike and made the long journey back, the pain in my legs drowned out by the feeling that I may never escape this place.

So here I am, back at home. Writing my past few days' worths of information. I crashed into bed last night and slept in until 6:00 pm. The last thing I remember before I went to sleep was something that I thought was a hallucination.

Across the street from my house was a man in a hoodie, staring at my window. And his head was Ablaze.

I thought that was just me beginning my dream, but now I'm not so sure. I think that The Burning Man, as I will call him, isn't like the other mindless killing machines that exist in this world. I think it is something more powerful. Because when I woke up today I found the body of The Grimm laying on the sidewalk by my house.

And it was burned to a crisp.

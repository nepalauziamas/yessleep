I was reaching for my phone when it happened. Stupid phone. As I was opening the door, I tripped, tumbling head-first down the hole.
 
The taste of shit was repugnant. The smell was worse. It wasn’t just fecal matter that found its way into my mouth; I’d consider myself lucky if that were the case. Blue dye and barf, bits of corn and re-fried beans, plus stringy lumps of stool. Gag. Shit and piss had a baby, and I was delivering it. When I pulled myself out, I was beyond recognition. Defecation and dung devoured me.
 
I’m a small man. Skinny, with gangly arms and toothpick legs. The runt of the litter, if you will. I’m no hulk. If I were, maybe I wouldn’t be in this mess. 
 
Wiping the feculence off my face was futile. I was filthy. Making matters worse, a large circle stained my crotch. I’d pissed myself. Self-pity grabbed me by the cojones. My mind went into overdrive.  
 
It was the hottest part of the day. Steam wafted from the torturesome turds like thick fog. Putrid particles pounced my nostrils, leaving me aghast. It was already a crappy day. Now this?
 
You see, after an arduous day at the office, full of surprise board meetings and random meltdowns by disgruntled coworkers, I grabbed an extra-large coffee for the drive home. Big mistake. The traffic crawled. At some point, when my bladder was about to burst, I pulled over onto a side road, and came upon an abandoned construction site. I was preparing to pee on the side of the road when I noticed an emanation: The Pink Porta-Potty.
 
I tripped on my way in, but I already told you that.
 
The sound of laughter greeted me at once. A crowd gathered. I shrugged. Ha Ha. A childish prank. Trapping me inside the poo-poo station, for shits and giggles. How cute. For a moment, I relished in it. I can take a joke. But let’s get this over with, shall we?
 
Wearily, I reached for the handle. It was stuck. No matter how hard I tried, it wouldn’t budge. 
 
“Lemme out of here!” I shouted, pounding on the door.
 
A rusty voice responded: “Sorry boy. I like you just where you are!”
 
The crowd chortled.
 
“Don’t get any on ya!” someone snickered.
 
“Looks like yer up Shit’s Creek!”
 
“Without any TP!”
 
They were having a ball. At my expense, no less. And sure enough, when I checked, the toilet paper dispenser was empty. It dawned on me that there may be a hidden camera in here. Ugh. Kill me now. I’d never been more humiliated in my life. Making matters worse, this is a rural area. The cell service is fine, but the idea of being rescued seemed as fruitless as wiping the stool from my heavily-soiled work shirt.
 
Just as I thought things couldn’t get worse, the porta-potty started moving.
 
The rusty voice shouted: “ON ONE…TWO…THREEEE!”
 
Suddenly, I was airborne. The porta-potty was tipping over. My face crashed into the soap dispenser, as a furry of feculence went flying. Before I knew it, the dwelling dropped exit-first, and the contents of the crapper came crashing down on me.
 
I was trapped.
 
The crowd hurrahed, then quickly dispersed, leaving me alone to wallow in my shit-infested misery.
 
Tears spilled like diarrhea. My urine-soaked jeans were caked in crap, my hair knotted with feces.
 
“Calm down,” I told myself, in between bouts of hysteria.
 
Crouching, as to not hit my head on the low-lying ceiling, I sat on the side of the urinal. Good thing I’m small. This would be impossible for a larger person. I took a deep breath, regretting it immediately. The smell was nauseating. It was a smell that could start a war.
 
What I needed was a plan. Fast. Soon, it will be dark, and the coyotes will arrive.  
 
The only way out was through the toilet. If I could squeeze inside, maybe I could shimmy my way to freedom. There’s bound to be an exit in there somewhere. Reluctantly, I peeked inside, and regretted it immediately. Clearly, this toilet hadn’t been cleaned in a very long time.
 
Something splashed.
 
I wasn’t alone.
 
Snake!
 
Maybe it was a rattler, maybe not. It was too dark to tell. Frantically, I reached for my phone – you know, the insidious device that landed me in the predicament in the first place – and turned on the flashlight. I went searching for the belly-crawling beast. It wasn’t difficult to imagine some revolting reptile skidding its way into my drawers. 

Although I could hear the snake slithering through the slippery sewage, I still couldn’t catch sight of it. Somehow, this made it worse. Fear turned to anger. Anger turned to strength. Using the toilet seat as a base, I sprung forward, crashing the top of the porta-potty. It made a small dent, so I lunged again and again, almost knocking myself out in the process. I kicked and clawed and scraped and scoured until my fingers bled, all the while screaming for help. 
 
Nothing. 
 
I was flushed.
 
You’re probably wondering why I didn’t call someone. That’s the real kicker. You see, I’m a loner. I moved up here recently, looking for affordable housing. I have yet to make any friends. Yes, I’m liked amongst my coworkers, but not on a ‘let's-grab-a-drink-after-work basis. Plus, I don’t have their digits, so I couldn’t reach out even if I wanted to. Besides, I could never let my coworkers see me like this.
 
I sulked. Could this day get any worse. Probably, yes. While leaning against the slow-dripping crap-can, wondering what to do next, I recalled a story my mother told me of her grandfather. It seemed funny at the time. Not so much now:
 
Gramps was stationed in France during the war. One night, while his army buddies were out on the town enjoying some bevies, Gramps needed to relieve himself. He found an outhouse. Somehow, while removing his trousers, his wallet fell into the toilet. This wallet contained important documents.
 
His army buddies lowered him into the bowels of the bunko booth, each holding a leg. Unable to see, Gramps used his hands to navigate through the feces, until he finally found his wallet. When they pulled him out, he was beyond recognition. His smell was inexcusable. They called him Shithouse Shelby after that. Sometimes they would sing: To Shit Upon a Starr, and have a good laugh.
 
Recalling this story certainly didn’t cheer me up, but it helped to pass the time.
 
…
 
So, yeah, that’s how I landed myself in this predicament. I’m still stuck inside a porta-potty. It’s getting late, I'm alone and scared. I tried calling 911, but the service is disabled. I even called the local police station, and was put on hold! Imagine my rage. While on hold, my phone dinged its unwelcomed warning: 20% battery life. It’s an old phone. It dies fast.
 
Time is of the essence.
 
As a last resort, I’m reaching out to Reddit.
 
Please help.
 
I’m freaking out. It’s pitch black in here, and I smell like raw sewage. If there's any good Samaritans out there, please come rescue me. There’s no way I’ll make it through the night. I’m terribly thirsty. My lips and tongue are bone-dry. Worse, I’ve got to pee. That extra-large coffee has really come back to bite me in the ass. This is the last place on earth I want to pee.
 
Please help. 
 
I’m scared shitless. I’ve kicked and clawed the walls more times than I can count. I even tried tipping the john over onto its side, resulting in me slipping and falling head-first into the toilet, yet again.
 
Something’s crawling on me.
 
A rat. Damn thing bit my arm, drawing blood. But hey, maybe the snake will eat the rat. Or maybe the snake is teaming up with the rat, planning unthinkable ways to torture me.
 
All I know is I’m on Reddit, typing frantically, as my phone threatens to die.
 
If you’re traveling along Highway 11, north of Barrie Ontario, and see a pink porta-potty flipped on its side, PLEASE turn it upright. Let me out. I’ll pay you. Or if you see a video of someone stuck inside a shithouse, don’t laugh. It’s probably me.
 
Crap! I dropped my phone. It ricocheted off the floor, plunging itself into the toilet. My dirty hands dug it out. Now my phone’s as vile as the excrement I just swallowed, retrieving the stupid thing.
 
Battery life: 15%.
 
Please help! Otherwise, I’ll have to wriggle through the crapper. And what if I get stuck? And lest we forget the creepy crawlers lurking inside the dung-dungeon.
 
Battery life: 13%
 
Gotta go. But before I go, I’ll promise you this: If I make it out alive, I’ll never set foot inside a porta-potty again. Ever!

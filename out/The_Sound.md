***Transcribed from tape labeled, “Taylor.”***

**TAYLOR:** “It sounded like a pod of whales, and looked like a sea of lights.”

My Layla passed away a few years ago. One morning she woke up and died. Doctor said something popped in her head. I never talked about it much. I guess a lot of us wish we had. I know I do.

I heard on the news it started at 12:42, when all the lights went out. Some people online said it was later than that. Of course, some said it was earlier. I don't know what time I heard The Sound. I only remember it was late, and cold. But, The Sound? The Sound... it was soft, pleasant. “It sounded like a pod of whales, but it looked like a sea of lights.” Sometimes I wish I could keep waking up to it. Sometimes, I dream that I do.

Layla waited for me outside the front door of our apartment. Pale in white, like the day I married her. And in The Sound, I heard her voice. She called, she cried. She said things - things only she knew. Things only I knew. Things she shouldn't know. Called me awful names when I wouldn't let her in. All I wanted to do was let her in.

I never thought I deserved Layla. She was too kind, too sweet, too understanding. Too trusting. I was a mess before she met me.

I was a mess when she married me. I was a bigger mess after she left me. I don't know what I am now. But to see her standing there? I didn't deserve to have her back. But I'm starting to think, maybe... maybe I deserved what came next.

From the window, I saw others opening their doors. They let in whatever they saw. I once heard someone saw a cat. So, who knows? But they saw what they saw. We all heard what we heard. And some of them... they opened their doors, and let that light in.

Our neighbors - sweet girl, awful mother. We used to hear them scream at each other through the walls. One day I realized the fighting stopped. Saw the girl one day in the laundry room, and she was all smiles. That night, when the sound began, she was screaming at her mother to go away. Screaming and screaming, “You're gone, you're gone! I killed you! You're gone!” She kept her door closed.

The woman across from us... she opened her door. She's gone now. Like everyone else.

My neighbor moved the next day. I helped her load a few boxes and bags into her car. We didn't say anything the entire time. Box, car, box, car. **(*****Chuckles.*****)** She didn't even thank me, now that I think about it. But before she drove off, she, uh... She said, “It sounded like a pod of whales, and looked like a sea of lights.” I don't know where she is now. I guess she's gone too.

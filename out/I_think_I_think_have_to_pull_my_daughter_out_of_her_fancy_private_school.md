Hey Redditors, I have a bit of a weird one here.  Sorry for spelling and rambling.  I may or may not be writing this after about three beers.  And by three I mean five. Also writing isn't really my thing. I went to public school, lol.

I (M42) and my wife “Anne” (F40) have one kid, our daughter “Madeline” (F5) (Obviously using pseudonyms here).  Madeline just recently started kindergarten at her first ‘real’ school.  Before she was at this great preschool/early childhood place that she adored, but it didn’t have any more grades.

Okay so as I mentioned, I went to public school, and I like to think I emerged a normal, educated person (my wife might disagree on the normal...), but Anne pointed out, and I have to agree, that the public schools in our district are hot garbage. They just don’t have the funding, and you want your kid to have every advantage, etc etc.

I admit I was not totally thrilled with the idea of private school.  It just kind of felt elitist? But I tagged along on school visits and tried not to roll my eyes too much.

Then we found Timber Ridge Academy.  The whole place is just ridiculously wholesome.  They have multiple acres of land in the city limits somehow, and all classrooms are outside under these pergolas or huge glamping style tents.

The kids bring vegetables from home for soup on Tuesdays, and bake bread on Thursdays. The website has all this stuff about the Scandinavian method of nurturing children, and encouraging an active imagination and connection with nature. This apparently prepares them to deal with academic rigor later.

I have to say they won me over.  It’s a little more expensive than I wish it was, but we’re willing to stretch a bit.  I was going to write something here about how much I love my daughter, but that’s annoying.  I know whenever I hear someone saying “my kid means everything to me” I want to be like “yeah, that’s the basic requirement”.  Congratulations, you are officially exactly the same as 99% of other parents everywhere in the world. You don’t get a medal for loving your kid.

But Madeline is the best though.  She has trouble with her L’s, and I love the way she says ‘smaw’ instead of small.  She got Anne’s blond hair, and we’ve never gotten it cut, so she just has this crazy mane of blonde flying around her head, down to her butt all the time. She just lost her first tooth, and COULD NOT have been prouder.

So fine.  We’ll send her to the obnoxiously wholesome ‘Academy’.  School's just starting up again, so Madeline has only been going for a little over a month.  Anne is ecstatic. I guess things have soured for me?  I’d do a summary but the things are sort of hard to describe.  Bear with me.

Actually the first thing that kind of rubbed me the wrong way was the questionnaire. You have an interview with the teacher once Maddy was accepted, and they want you to fill out like 9 pages of questions, some of which were semi-bizarre.

Like there was a question ”Does your child talk during the night?”.  Maddy actually does, hilariously, but why do you need to know?“

Does your child have an Imaginary Friend?  What is its name?”

Maddy doesn’t. Now both Anne and I are more introverted. We’re not shut-ins, but both of us were very much ‘play by yourself in your own little world’ when we were kids, and we assumed Madeline would be the same.  Nope.  Maddy is running for mayor every day. The kind of kid you can take to a playground and just tell her ‘make two friends and don’t bother us for 4 hours’ and she is happy as a clam.  So she has no interest in an imaginary friend.  She wants to spend every minute with her real ones.

But the questions got weirder: “Describe any significant trauma your child experienced in the previous 36 months”.  There wasn’t one, but also that’s incredibly intrusive?

“Was your child delivered by cesarean or other surgical intervention?”.  What possible relevance could that possibly have?

Anne told me I was being oversensitive, and all schools ask this stuff.

Then we had the teacher interview. Maddy wasn’t there, we just went to her teachers office.  Mrs. Keeley.  She’s a bit older.  Quite thin with very curly gray hair. She has this habit of talking to everyone in the same voice you use when talking to Kindergarteners, but whatever.  She seemed pretty good actually.  Lots of talk about how Madeline should be peeling her own oranges and opening her own wrappers, to encourage fine motor skills and build independence and self confidence. Makes sense.

They are very big on imagination. She actually seemed disappointed that Maddy didn’t have an imaginary friend.

“Not even a stuffy she takes everywhere?”  Nope. No Calvin and Hobbes situation here.  Plenty of real friends though, shouldn’t that be enough?

Anyway the school year starts, and once again everything is wholesome as shit. They don’t open the doors until 8:15 on the dot, so everyone lines up outside, and Mrs. Keeley greets each of them at the door individually, welcomes them in, and says goodbye to the parents.

Mrs. Keeley was very insistent that parents could not come into the classroom.  At first that rubbed me the wrong way, but then after three days, she explained that it was a way of having children feel ownership of the class and process.  And on the day after that, she had each of the kids give a tour of the classroom to the parents, and I could see Maddy just beaming that she was the tour guide, and that she had to explain everything to us.  She just about popped when she showed us her cubby that she had decorated with a picture of a dragonfly all by herself.  Alright, so one point for Timber Ridge.

But one thing bothered me right away.  Maddy had made really good friends at her preschool, and had expressed, in her 5-year-old way, a lot of anxiety that she wouldn’t get to hang out with them every day anymore.  It was kinda heartbreaking. So we scheduled a ton of stuff after school with her old friends, to make sure the transition wasn’t harsh.

She loved that for about a week and a half.

But then one afternoon she didn’t want to hang out with her old friends.  She wanted to stay at home and play by herself.  Anne and I had different reactions.  I was bothered.  She ALWAYS wants to play with friends. This was the first time in, I’m pretty sure, ever, that she hasn’t wanted to do a play date.

Anne was over the moon. To be fair, Madeline basically refuses to play on her own. She is constantly trying to drag one of us into it, or get a friend over.  And if we insist she entertain herself, she gets mad and asks to watch a show.  (Timber Ridge *strongly* encourages parents to restrict ‘disruptive media’ to one day a week, to foster imagination.  Which sounds great, but also who actually does this?)So Anne sees Madeline wanting to play by herself as a sign of growth and maturity. I kinda felt like it was out of character, but Anne says I’m just jaundiced about the whole private school thing (one of the reasons I’m asking Reddit's opinion instead).

Then about a week later, in the evening, I yell down to Maddy that it’s 5 minutes till brush teeth, and she tells me that ‘Charcoal wants to play dolly bedtime’.

I’m sorry, what?

So after some very gentle and patient probing, it comes out that Maddy has a new imaginary friend, Charcoal. Again, Anne loves the new, imaginative Madeline.  I can’t help but feel weird.  Like the school was really focused on all the kids having imaginary friends and then suddenly she has one?  On the other hand, Maddy has the tendency to name her plushies things like “princess sparkles” so I guess at least the name is interesting.

I know it probably seems like I’m just getting into my own head about this, but I can’t help it, it’s my kid.

A few days after, I’m picking Maddy up from school. The kids spend basically all day outside, and there is kind of a fenced off wooded area they play in after class winds down.  Since we’re supposed to respect the kids play-space, parents come up to a wooden gate and ring this little bell.  Then Mrs. Keeley or one of the after-school teachers will fetch our kid, collect their basket, and bring them over.

(that’s right, I said basket.  Lunch boxes are not allowed, children must have a woven wicker basket with a cloth to bring lunch in. Can you feel my eyes rolling?)

Anyway I'm there to pick up Maddy, and there is another parent in front of me. They have a daughter in Madeline’s class named Steph.  (There was a child-and-parents mixer thing before the semester started, and I watched this Steph kid sit behind her mom and root around with her finger up her nose for seven and a half (7.5) minutes.  I timed it on my phone.  Let’s just say I’m moderating my hopes for that kid, but whatever.)

And as Steph is coming through the pick-up gate with her basket, she’s talking to her mom about eating her lunch, and she says “but Charcoal doesn’t like the taste, so I finished it.”  And the mom saw me and rolled her eyes, but I just couldn’t stop myself.Charcoal?

Turns out, Steph has an imaginary friend named Charcoal.

Huh.

I bent down and asked how long Steph had had her friend, but she kinda shrugged at me.  Now, it turns out, there is a… limited amount of time you can interrogate the child of a person you don’t know. Then they get weirded out and uncomfortable.  So I didn’t get a ton of information.

Then Madeline comes to the gate.  When we got in the car, I asked her about Charcoal.  Had Steph told her about Charcoal?  Is that where she got the idea?  She gave me this look in the rear-view mirror like I was the world’s biggest idiot.

One thing about kids is that they have trouble imagining that there are things in the world you don’t know.  Ever try to have a 5 year old summarize the plot of a TV show for you?  It’s baffling. They’ll be like “...and then the captain told kwazi about the vampire squid from before!”  And of course you don’t know who any of those people are. But kids just can’t internalize that you aren’t with them all the time. How could you not already know all this?

So eventually she gets it. Daddy doesn’t know that… Mrs. Keeley introduced her to Charcoal.

Again, Anne doesn’t see the problem.  A teacher's job is to foster a child’s imagination, etc.

But why?  Why does this woman feel like it’s so important that my child have an imaginary friend? And why is it the same one as the other kid?  Shouldn’t kids be allowed to make up their own?  She did ‘introduce’ both of them, right?

I couldn’t get much out of Madeline.  If you’re a parent, you know that kids can get reticent and embarrassed when you start asking them about what they imagine when they play alone.  It’s their time, I get it.  But I’m having trouble letting it go. I actually asked Maddy if she would draw a picture of Charcoal.  Anne liked this idea too, but immediately Maddy says “Oh no, Mrs. Keeley said we mustn't.”

Two things: first, “mustn’t”?  It is the year of our lord 2022.  Neither Madeline or anyone else in this family has ever used the word ‘mustn’t’.  Ever.

I will grant that the word mustn’t isn’t in itself problematic.  Anne pointed this out (I believe her exact words were “what the fuck is wrong with you?’) and okay, maybe it’s not that big a deal.

But also, why *mustn't* she draw a picture of her imaginary friend? Why would you tell a kid that? Does that seem off to anyone else?  We did not get a drawing of Charcoal.

Which brings us to two days ago.  Anne is upstairs in our library, having a Zoom and wine video call with her friends from high school. They started it during the pandemic and have kept it up.  I’m scrolling Reddit and decompressing after work.  The house is quiet, which I have to admit is much more common since we started at Timber Ridge.  Madeline is in her room.

I got up to go to the bathroom, and I walked past Madeline’s door. She was still. Standing still staring up at the ceiling, with her mouth open.  I kept walking.

My mom used to talk about the importance of ‘deliberate inattention’ with children.  If they feel like you are watching them every second, they get stifled. They become afraid, in essence, to be weird, and it’s important for kids to feel like they can be weird.  They are growing, and learning, and becoming themselves, and they need space for that.

But you have to watch over them.  So even when you *are* watching them, they should feel like you are not. Like they have space. Deliberate inattention.

But as I stood there trying to pee, it bugged me.  It had been *too* off.  When I said staring at the ceiling, I don’t mean looking up.  It’s hard to describe.  Her face pointed directly above her, exactly parallel to the ceiling.  Her head was pitched back so far it looked uncomfortable, with her blond hair in a sheet behind her.  And her mouth wasn’t just open, it was as far open as it would go.  Like she was stretching her jaw.  Or maybe like she had her mouth too full of a liquid and was trying to keep it from spilling.

It was just… unnatural.  So I go back to her room, and there she is.  She hasn’t moved.  And I’m standing in the doorway, and looking at her, and I started to feel really upset.  I can’t describe it.  Just distressed. And then suddenly Maddy notices me and jumps about a foot in the air.  Turns bright red.

I walked in and I put my arms around her, but she pushed me away at first.  My wife does this too.  Surprise them and they get embarrassed and angry.  But eventually Maddy let me hug her.  And of course I ask her, what are you doing, monkey? (yeah, Little Monkey.  I don’t know where these nicknames come from either).

She didn’t say anything.  But sometimes you can just wait.  I stood there, and I held her, and finally, she said

“That’s what Charcoal is like.”

“Like what, monkey?  What do you mean?”

“That’s how Charcoal comes up to you.”

“With his mouth like that?  What do you mean?  It walks around like that?”

She just shrugged.  That’s all I could get out of her.

That’s what led to the fight with Anne.  I *know* something is off.  The image of my daughter, alone in her room.  Still.  Head back, mouth open.  It’s really kinda burrowed into my head. Anne doesn’t get it.  She didn’t see it.

And so when I said I was putting my foot down, and that we needed to look for a different school, she flipped.  In the interests of fairness, I will summarize her argument.

1. I was against the idea of private school from the start, and I’m looking for problems.
2. This isn’t just a transition for Madeline. It’s a transition for us, too. This is the first big milestone in her growing up. Sure, it’s a teacher, but we’re still putting her in the hands of a stranger. It’s hard to trust.

Anne’s right about all that.  As much as you want to, you can’t guarantee your child will be safe.  Bad things do, in fact, happen. Someone, somewhere, who is reading this right now, had something terrible happen to them as a child. The best you can do is …I don’t know.  Your best.And I’ve begun to realize the deal with the devil we all make as parents.  You give birth to this beautiful, incredible little bundle.  And your job as a parent is to lay a path.  A path that leads, step by step, away from you.  Until finally, if you’ve done your job, they end up gone. Out in the world, on their own.  Alone.

Jesus.  That’s enough of that shit. I’m getting off topic.  I need your support, Reddit.  Anne didn’t see it. Am I being irrational, or do I need to trust my gut, and pull my daughter out of her perfect little kindergarten?

I'll post an update once one of us wins this argument.

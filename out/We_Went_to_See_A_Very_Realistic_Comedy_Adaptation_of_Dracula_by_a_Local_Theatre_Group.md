 My boyfriend’s friend John is one of those “theatre guys”- really into amateur theatrics and local community theatre groups. He asked my boyfriend to go with him to see this comedic adaptation of Dracula which some of his friends were putting on. My boyfriend asked me if I wanted to join, and even though horror and all that stuff isn’t really my thing, I agreed. Things are slowly opening up after the pandemic and I hadn’t been to a live play in what felt like forever.

So the three of us drove to this suburban theatre- a good twenty minutes drive away from downtown. I picked up some weird vibes from John- I had only met him once before this, and it looked like he had no idea I was joining them or whatever. We chatted nicely enough, I didn’t know there was a theatre in those parts, right down a leafy old trail there was this pretty historic building, home of the local theatre group of Elmsview for the past 50 years. And it seemed as if everybody felt the same way about getting out and going to a play- the whole trail was lined with parked cars and steady stream of theatre-goers were entering the building. People were clearly thirsting for live entertainment. We had to park a good ten minutes away. 

There were comedy-style graphics of Dracula everywhere, in black with red dripping from his fangs. Honestly I don’t get why grown men get so excited about Dracula but I could tell John and my boyfriend were super into it, they were excitedly googling different movie versions and I sipped on a glass of wine and waited for the play to start. 

The chairs in the theatre were super-comfortable and I had had a long day at work and the wine I had before the play started was going to my head, I felt quite drowsy. I vaguely remembered the Dracula storyline from the 1990s Winona Ryder version. This was an all-female troupe of actors and once in a while the actor playing Von Helsing would yell “Conveyancing is the term for real estate transactions” in a German accent and the audience including my boyfriend and John thought that was the funniest thing ever. The actress playing Dracula was beautiful, wearing a black cape with a red lining, jumping around and delivering her lines with quite a zing. 

I remembered the Lucy/Meena plotline. When the vampires bit Lucy, blood spurted every where and she slumped quite heavily. An acrid sour smell rose into the air. I felt uneasy for the first time that evening. I glanced at the guys and they were transfixed, staring at the stage. John’s eyes were glowing in the dark lights in a strange way. 

At the interval, we went back into the bar and I got another glass of wine. The guys were chatting excitedly about the special effects and how realistic the blood looked, which I agreed with. 

Then John offered to take my boyfriend backstage and meet the actors, claiming he knew them quite well. My boyfriend turned to me and asked if I wanted to go to, but I was quite happy nursing my wine sitting at the bar and told them to go ahead. Also the Dracula-lady gave me the creeps. 

So the two went off and I sipped my wine. People started leaving the bar and the bell rang, I think a good five or six minutes had passed and there was no sign of them. 

So I got up and followed the arrow printed with “Backstage” with curly lettering. The posters with the black and red Dracula prints loomed everywhere. 

I came to a door which had the sign “The Star. Please knock!”

I didn’t knock. I just wanted to find my boyfriend and get out of this creepy theatre building. 

I opened the door slowly and saw them. 

My boyfriend was slumped back in an ornate gold armchair, half-facing me, his eyes closed, his long legs stretched out. Lady Dracula was bent over him, her teeth sunk into neck, exactly like the scene with Lucy. Blood and lipstick were smeared scarlet on his neck. And John was standing over them, his face lit up with glee. 

I don’t know how long I was standing there, staring at the three of them. My boyfriend moaned and moved slightly, his eyelids fluttered. John looked up and saw me, smiled and put his finger on his lips. Somebody seemed to move in the background. A voice outside called “Time please!”

My paralysis broke. Without saying a word I turned and fled, down the long windy corridor with the posters and red lights, following the neon flickering exit signs. I ran as fast as I could, and soon enough I was pushing at the heavy door, and then stepped outside in the fresh cool spring evening air, panting heavily. 

It was dark now, and I didn’t know which door I had exited from- I looked around- before me were trees and unfamiliar cars- I had no idea where our car was. The door closed behind me. I paused- almost tempted to go back in the building and find the main entrance- I was sure I could find our car from there. And then the door swung open. 

My boyfriend stood in the doorway, John at his side and slightly behind. He looked fresh, alert. 

He reached a hand towards me. “Sima, where are you going? The second half just started. Don’t you want to see the rest of the play?”

I stepped back, towards the trees, shaking my head. In the light from the theatre, I could glimpse the blackness smeared on his neck. 

“Don’t go Sima. Come back and watch the play with us, it’s really fun!” But he didn’t move, remaining well inside the threshold.

I turned and started running. They remained in the building, the door slowly closed and I was alone in the dark. I grabbed my mobile and frantically scrabbled to turn on the flashlight. 

I ran on, looking for the car. I could hear the laughing and whispering in the trees- “Sima! Sima! You’re missing the play!”

I found the car. I jumped in and sped away. 

I broke up with my boyfriend via text once I was home, and never saw him after that.

Who do you think you are?

I have been confronted with information that has shaken me to my core, causing me to question anything and everything about who I am. What is a lie and what is the truth? Is it better to know the truth or is it better to live in ignorance? Does fate ever change?

It started three centuries ago.

From late 1683 to early 1685, over one hundred men and women were accused, fifty were tried and convicted, and twenty–five were hanged as witches in Eden Village.

My grandmother was one of them.

I should be more specific. My great–(x16)–grandmother, Mary Noyes, was accused of witchcraft, tried and convicted, but her conviction was overturned. However, I have to admit that even I do not know whether she should be considered innocent or guilty.

Before Salem, there was Eden.

I did not know anything about my connection to the Eden witch trials until recently, when I found an old, tattered book among my recently deceased great–grandmother’s belongings. The book was faded and worn, but I was able to see that its author was John Hale, my great–(x14)–grandfather, Mary Noyes’ grandson. In 1722, John published his grandmother’s memoirs, which she dictated to him. I was nagged by a thought that came to mind. Why would Granny hide this from me?

Nevertheless, I started reading. The book opens with a preface from its author, and its conclusion is transcribed below.

*In the year about sixteen–hundred eighty–four, a great delusion of Satan deceived the people of the Village of Eden; ’twas a Reminder of the wiles of the Devil in Paradise at the beginning of Creation. Although ignorant and unwitting accomplices (so it may seem) of the ancient serpent, these people nevertheless brought upon themselves and their land the guilt of innocent blood. As we implore the forgiveness of God, we will now remember in particular the Life of one accused of those grievous crimes against God and man, namely, Goodwife Mary Noyes, born Lewis, wife of John Noyes, Sr., mother of Elizabeth, Martha, John, Jr., and Faith. Her words have been used as the base for these Memoirs.*

The book describes Mary’s life for her first twenty–nine years, before the onset of the witch trials. Mary Lewis was born c. 1654 in Eden Village, the third child of William Lewis (b. 1622 – d. 1674) and Ann Warren (b. 1630 – d. 1680). As was custom, Mary was married before her five younger sisters. She married John Noyes (b. 1650 – d. 1715), the son of a minister, in c. 1673. She and John had four children, Elizabeth (b. 1674 – d. 1704), Martha (b. 1677 – d. 1754), John, Jr. (b. 1682 – d. 1742), and Faith (b. 1684 – d. 1757). Many of the pages of the book are faded to the point of illegibility, and therefore I selected the most pertinent passages to illustrate the events of the witch trials, from Mary’s point of view. My notes are in brackets.

*’Twas a wild–woody, rocky, remote, bushy wilderness, rife with sin, a land that did not even know God. Yet He makes all things new. In my lifetime, the land was tilled, seeds were sown and crops were reaped, and the Almighty was made known to all.*

*However, even in Eden, it was not always peaceful.*

*The Troubles began in the Winter of sixteen–hundred eighty–three. ’Twas a brutally cold season, which followed on the heels of a disappointing harvest. Many did not make it into the year of our Lord sixteen–hundred eighty–four. Those of us who survived buried our brothers and sisters in Christ in the thawing ground. As we approached spring, we hoped that our trials and tribulations were behind us.*

*That was not to be.*

*On the last Sabbath of February, Reverend* [Samuel] *Pearson, minister of the Village, delivered a sermon on the afflictions, “scourges of God,” which suddenly befell his daughter, Ann, who was not yet ten years of age, as well as her friends, Sarah and Mercy Whitcomb, and their friends, Mary Hobbs and Tamsin Dane. The girls exhibited a variety of unusual signs and symptoms. They screamed, especially during prayer, and cried out in pain, complaining of being pinched and pricked with pins seen only by them. They contorted themselves into unnatural positions, crawled like dogs on the floor, threw things at the walls and other people. Mr. Pearson was himself injured when his daughter threw their Bible at his head. Dr.* [James] *Barnard, the local physician, was unable to diagnose the girls with any ailment in particular. According to Mr. Pearson, Dr. Barnard declared their symptoms went “beyond natural disease,” and suggested that an “evil Hand” might be the cause of their afflictions.*

*At the meeting, Mr. Pearson was interrupted repeatedly by the outbursts of the afflicted girls. He declared,* “There are malefactors among us. The Devil is laying siege to this Village. And he is being aided by wicked and reprobate men to torment these children!” *Upon his declaration, Ann Pearson collapsed onto the floor of the meetinghouse, screaming for help from an unseen assailant. She was unable to be calmed by her father nor Dr. Barnard, the former of whom asked in exasperation,* “Who torments you?” *All of the girls cried out at once,* “Goody Williams! Goody Oliver! Goody Jacobs!”

It was through research at the local library that I learned more information about the first three women accused of witchcraft in Eden. Mary Jacobs (née Abbot; b. 1636 – d. 1684), Sarah Oliver (née Abbot; b. 1634 – d. 1684), and Sarah Williams (née Carrier; b. 1644 - d. 1684), were related to each other. Mary and Sarah Abbot were sisters; Sarah Carrier was their cousin. They were all married with children. However, they were not highly regarded by their neighbours in Eden, most of whom considered Mary and Sarah Abbot “burdens,” because the sisters were driven to begging for food and shelter with their mother following their father’s death. Although they seldom begged from their neighbours as adults, the sisters nevertheless retained their reputation as “loathsome beggars.”

Sarah Carrier was accused of fornication in adolescence, and she and her lover were publicly whipped for their alleged crimes. Her reputation as “little less than [a] whore” persisted even after her marriage to Jonas Williams (b. 1636 – d. 1706), with whom she had five children. The paternity of her children came into question among the villagers, some of whom spread “vile slander” that she was an adulteress.

The three women were outcasts in Eden Village. No one would come to their defence. After they were arrested, they were interrogated for several days, and then they were jailed in March 1684.

*The examinations were public. Goody Jacobs accused her sister* [Sarah Oliver] *of bewitching the children, while Goody Oliver accused Goody Jacobs of being the witch.*

“It is [Mary] Jacobs who torments these children,” *Goody Oliver said.*

*Goody Jacobs was asked,* “Why do you hurt these children?” 

*She answered,* “I do not hurt them. I scorn it. It is my Sister [Sarah Oliver] who hurts them.”

*Goody Jacobs accused Goody Oliver of signing the Devil’s book, and Goody Oliver said the same of her. I was taken aback by the sisters’ lack of loyalty to each other.*

*Goody Williams was the last to be questioned, and she was asked,* “What evil spirit do you have familiarity with?”

*She answered,* “None. I am innocent. I have done no witchcraft.”

*She refused to confess to witchcraft, and she refused to implicate her cousins in witchcraft. Nevertheless, the women were questioned repeatedly over the period of a week, and then they were jailed to await their trials.*

*Mr.* [Jacob] *Porter, one of the first formal complainants against Goody Jacobs and Goody Oliver, claimed they placed a curse upon him after he refused them charity. He had a heifer on his farm, who was calving for the first time. The labour was difficult. After the calf was delivered, it was apparent that it was deformed.* “’Tisn’t right,” *Mr. Porter said. The calf was extremely small. Its hide was in patches, mixed with what appeared to be human flesh. Its cry was like a newborn baby. Its hooves resembled disfigured human feet. We were terrified. What was this creature? Mr. Porter retrieved his gun, and he shot the calf dead. His heifer died soon thereafter. The witnesses of this prodigious birth were convinced that it was caused by the sisters’ witchery.*

*Goody* [Mary] *Tyler testified,* “Goody Williams asked me if I would sell her one of my sows. I could not sell her any of my livestock after the poor harvest. She muttered foul words under her breath after I refused her. On the following day, I awoke to find my sows dead, their bodies mutilated and their piglets stolen from their wombs.” *On the Sabbath after Goody Tyler’s pigs were slaughtered, we were horrified to find one of the piglets nailed to the cross in the meetinghouse. Its blood dripped onto the wooden floor. The rest of the litter was placed in a circle around the pulpit. It was abominable. Mr. Pearson preached outside the meetinghouse, saying,* “This is truly the Devil’s handiwork.” *More witnesses came forward to accuse the three women, all of whom were currently in jail, of causing the failure of their crops and the deaths of their livestock. During his sermons, Mr. Pearson expounded on the eighteenth verse from Exodus, Chapter Twenty–Two, that is,* “Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.”

The first accusations explicitly mentioning witchcraft occurred after the desecration of the meetinghouse. The main accusers were Ann Pearson, Sarah and Mercy Whitcomb, Mary Hobbs, and Thomasin (“Tamsin”) Dane, but there were others, most of whom were also adolescent girls. The afflicted girls were held in high esteem by most of the villagers of Eden. As Mary’s memoirs imply, villagers who were critical of the afflicted girls were usually accused of witchcraft themselves. I could feel the fear Mary felt when confronted with the possibility of the hangman’s rope. I continued reading.

*I will admit I had misgivings about the girls and their accusations, but I dared not to say anything in public, out of my fear of being accused of witchcraft myself. Although I recognise now that what I did was cowardly, I did not want to be separated from my children. Therefore, I remained silent, and I expressed my fears to God alone.*

*However, I was only more suspicious after I overheard the girls’ conversation outside of the meetinghouse on the first Sabbath of March.*

“’Tis about her third month,” *Mercy Whitcomb said.*

“What is she to do?” *Mary Hobbs asked.*

“Will she not be whipped as a whore?” *Tamsin Dane added.*

“Perhaps,” *Mercy said.*

“’Tis all a part of the plan. I know what to say to divert attention away from my sin,” *Sarah Whitcomb said.* “After my belly grows bigger, I will accuse a boy of seducing me with his sorceries.”

*Ann Pearson asked,* “Who will that be?”

“I do not know, but I will do my duty,” *Sarah answered.* “For the Master.”

*I was unable to hear the rest, but what I was able to glean from what I heard was that Sarah Whitcomb was with child. However, I did not know who the father was. Was it their Master? Who was he? Was he a mortal man, or was he something else entirely?*

*In a whisper, the girls said all at once,* “For the Master.”

*The Master?* I could not help but wonder, as Mary did, who or what their Master was. Thinking of the possibilities sent a shiver down my spine. The memoirs continued.

*I walked back into the meetinghouse to speak with Mr. Pearson, but I saw him speaking with the elders of the church, Goody* [Martha] *Reed, the catechist of the Village, as well as godmother of my daughter* [Martha Noyes], *and Mr.* [John] *Howe, so I turned around to leave. However, I could hear Mr. Pearson whisper to Goody Reed,* ‘She is pregnant.’ *Although I knew it was wrong, I hid behind one of the pillars in the meetinghouse, and I listened in on Mr. Pearson’s conversation.*

“’Tis about her third month,” *Mr. Pearson said.*

*Goody Reed asked,* “How do you know?”

“She sought advice from a midwife,” *Mr. Pearson answered.*

*The deacon of the church, Mr. Howe, asked,* “What shall we do?”

“She shall be punished for her crime after she is delivered,” *Mr. Pearson said.* “We want to spare the innocent child any harm.”

*Learning Sarah Whitcomb was indeed pregnant planted the first seed of my doubts regarding the girls and their accusations. If they were not the good Christian girls that the Village esteemed them to be, then what were they? Who was to say they were not lying? Nevertheless, I continued to express these feelings to God alone, lest they also accuse me of witchcraft. . . .*

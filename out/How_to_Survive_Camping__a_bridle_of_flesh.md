I run a private campground.  [Last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/k331e4/how_to_survive_camping_a_strip_of_skin/) I said that I might not survive to post again, but here we are.  I’ve got stitches in my forehead, I’m on a decent amount of pain meds, and my brother will hate me if he ever finds out what I’ve done.  But I’m alive.

If you’re new here, you should really [start at the beginning](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/clp5h4/how_to_survive_camping/), and if you’re totally lost, [this might help](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/comments/fz6a1d/how_to_survive_camping_index/).

I went to the family graveyard just after dawn.  It felt like the right thing to do.  I sat in front of my parent’s gravestone and stared at the matching dates of when they died.  I’ve faced my own death before.  I hear it every night, skulking outside the window, circling the house in search of the little girl from which it takes its appeasement.  Yet that is a vague future and I fear it in much the same way that you may fear a cancer diagnosis or a car crash.  It is one of many possible ends.  It can be held at bay in the mind as a remote possibility.

What I contemplated that morning was a death so close at hand I could feel its breath on the back of my neck.  There was a deadline.  It is one thing to expect to die.  It is another to be able to count the minutes.

I think I sought some kind of peace.  The presence of my parents, perhaps.  But my vigil only served to remind me that they are dead and gone and I was facing this alone.

It was almost a relief when the sun rose, for I could at least get moving and feel like I was doing *something* to save myself and my niece.

There was a bundle on the porch when I returned to my house.  At first I thought it was a dead snake, then I thought it was rope.  As I drew closer I saw the buckles and realized it was a crafted item, the leather thongs cut as thin as embroidery floss.  Tentatively, I picked it up and let it unfold, trying to decipher the fastenings and in what arrangement they were supposed to lay.  The leather was soft and supple and I thought it would break, when I tested one of the cords for strength.  It held, however, and the more I tried the more I realized that it was not going to break, not for me, or any creature human or otherwise.

I’ve seen such craftsmanship before.

A gift from the harvesters.

It was a bridle.  A bridle cut from the strip of skin they took from my brother.

I was revolted just holding it.  How could I not be?  The feel of my brother’s skin, so soon after watching him suffer as it was peeled from his arm.  Under ordinary circumstances I think I would have hurled it into the bottom of a desk drawer and tried to forget about its existence.  But desperation allows us to do things that were once detestable.  It is a powerful force.

I took the bridle with me.

The old sheriff had offered his help with this problem, but I’d turned him down.  This wasn’t something we could fix with guns.  What kind of gun do you use to take down something the size of an elephant, anyway?  No, this was a problem that had to be solved with inhuman means.  My normal allies didn’t have the ability.  Beau at least seemed to approve of the plan, when I told him, though I couldn’t tell if it was because it would work or if he was pleased that the dapple-gray stallion wouldn’t see it coming.

That’s right.  For all you smartasses in the comments last post, it’s *Kate* coming out of the corner with a steel chair.

(also, not sure what that “NFC” stuff was about, but if it has anything to do with old land, could the owner I dunno, *message* me or something? We should chat)

I went to my neighbor’s property.  The one with the lake.  I stood at the edge and took a deep breath.  It was quite a bit early, but I didn’t have any better ideas.  This *had* to work.  I had to *make* it work.  So I mustered all that anger and frustration and I piled it into my chest and then with all the strength I had, I yelled down at the water.

“Hey assholes!” I cried.  “Do you want to help me save Christmas?”

For a few minutes, nothing happened.  I stood there with my heart hammering, feeling mildly self-conscious, and waited.  If they didn’t show, I told myself, I would swim down to the bottom of that lake and *drag* them up.  Then, just as I was getting ready to yell again, a single ripple appeared in the center of the lake.  It spread outwards until it reached the bank and vanished.  As soon as the water had returned to a mirror surface, the stillness shattered again.  The surface churned, fairly *boiling* with activity, and then a horse’s head surged out of the water.  It ducked its head, forelegs straining to drag it upwards, and then the rider broke through the surface.  He sat proudly on the horse’s back, unstirred by its struggles, back straight with one hand on the reins, the other on the hilt of his sword.  The pointed tip on his helmet glinted in the bright sunlight.  Around him, the water continued to churn as more horses and their riders appeared, climbing their way out of the water and stamping to a stop in a row in front of me.

My “summoning ritual” had worked.  The shulikun had come.

The lead rider leaned down out of the saddle, putting his face close to mine.  He smelled strongly of peppermint.

“We don’t care to be insulted,” he said sternly.

“I knew it’d get your attention.”

“You play a dangerous game here, camp manager.”

He swung himself back in the saddle, leaving behind a faint scent of evergreen.

“I’m all out of fucks to give.  I need your help.”

And I explained the situation.  They, of course, wanted to know what this had to do with saving Christmas.  Wasn’t it obvious, I snapped at them.  They cared that *everyone* was in the Christmas spirit and if just one person wasn’t, well then down to a cold and watery grave they went.  So wouldn’t they care if there was one family out there that would spend their Christmas in mourning, because their first-born child had been stolen from them and wouldn’t be there to celebrate their first Christmas?  How can *anyone* possibly enjoy Christmas with such a heavy burden on their shoulders?

They considered.  The riders shifted in their saddles, glancing at one another and they conferred in low voices and I am actually not sure if it was Russian or not.  Finally, they all turned to stare down at me again and my heart raced, knowing that this was the moment of judgement.

“A child’s first Christmas should be joyous,” the shulikun intoned.  “We will help.”

I wasn’t going to argue, but I still think the whole ‘first Christmas’ thing is a bit silly when the child isn’t going to remember *any* of it.

The lead rider edged his horse forwards and reached a hand down towards me.  I stared at it suspiciously.

“I was… hoping to borrow a horse?” I suggested tentatively.

In the stories, it takes a horse to defeat a horse.

“Do you know how to ride?”

“Does it matter?  Aren’t they… magical horses?”

His eyes narrowed.

“Get on,” he said tersely.

I took his hand and he swung me up into the saddle.  It was graceful only because the shulikun heaved me high enough to grab my waist and then spun me about before I hit the saddle like I was a ballerina or something.  I’m honestly shocked I didn’t kick the horse in the head.  I barely had time to situate myself properly.  My legs were almost overlapping with his, as the saddle afforded very little room for me.  His body was cold against my back and the smell of mint was overwhelming.

Then he kicked his horse into motion and I was bounced up and almost fell off sideways, but his arms on the reins went around my body and kept me in place.  The shulikun yelled orders at his companions as we went.  The horses covered yards at a time, each step sending the scenery lurching past as a dizzying rate.  We were at the edge of the property, then across the road, then racing down the street that ran parallel to the campground.  The horses jumped a car at one point and I twisted in the saddle to see if the driver had even noticed us, but we were too far away and the car had vanished and we were cutting into a field that sat between the campground and the town.

“What’s your plan?” the shulikun asked.

“Uh, I have a bridle,” I said.

“We’ll get you close and I’ll throw you onto its back.”

“I won’t last a second.”

The shulikun only laughed, a deep, humorless laugh in the back of his throat.  Predatory.  I remained silent, afraid to ask what they planned to do, keenly aware that we only know the sanitized version of Christmastime.  The stories of old have *teeth* and I had invoked creatures from the early time when the world was raw and dangerous and death walked hand-in-hand with humanity.

The dapple-gray stallion came to meet us.  We were at the edge of the field, riding parallel to the woods.  The stallion burst through the trees, smashing the young saplings aside as it emerged.  The shulikun split in two, each group veering sharply away from the stallion, branching out to race diagonally away from it.  The monstrous horse pursued.  I could not see it around the shulikun’s body and I did not dare lean out to look, as the horse was in a full gallop now and I felt like I was going to bounce wildly off its back if I eased my death-grip on the saddle for a moment.

“Hold these,” the shulikun said, shoving the reins into my hands.

“The hell do I do with them?” I yelled, aghast.

“Don’t drop them.  That’s all.”

Clearly the horse knew what it needed to do.  I swore under my breath and hunkered low over the saddle, wrapping the reins around my hands so I could keep clutching the saddle for some vestige of stability.  The shulikun twisted behind me and I risked a half-glance backwards to see what the hell he was doing.

He was drawing back a horse bow.

I… really wish I knew more about these thing’s origins.

He fired.  The other riders were doing the same.  I could see the dapple-gray stallion’s head now, its lips peeled back to reveal its canines, breath coming out in steamy clouds and its eyes were wide and fixed on the horses it pursued, wild with hunger.  It was gaining.

The arrow stuck into its neck.  The dapple-gray stallion didn’t seem to notice, even as more arrows struck its neck and sides.  A little blood leaked out, but that was all.  Behind me, the shulikun dropped its bow back over the quiver and wrapped something around his wrists.  I saw it glint in the sunlight.  A thread, shimmering like silver, connecting him to the arrow.

A tether.

The horse carrying us slowed down.  The dapple-gray stallion veered sharply in our direction, hooves churning, stretching its head and opening its mouth for the fatal bite at the other horse’s throat.  Opposite us, the shulikun jerked hard on their own tethers, their horses straining to pull the stallion back and away from us, forcing it to keep going straight ahead.

So this was how they were going to keep it from throwing me off.  It was surrounded now and so long as the tethers held, it would not be able to move wildly in any one direction.

“There is your child!” the shulikun shouted at me.  “Be mindful - we will be most displeased if you kill the one you recruited us to save.”

I got one glance at what he was referring to before he grabbed hold of the back of my jacket.  One glimpse before I was heaved into the air and sent flying through the distance between me and the dapple-gray stallion.

A child rode on its back.  She was dressed in rags and carried a stout stick that had been carved to a point at one end as a makeshift spear.  Her hair was matted and wild and it was the same muddy brown as my own.  Old blood stained her hands like she was wearing crimson gloves.

Then I landed almost on top of her.

I hit the horse sideways, my stomach over top of its back.  Its body was so broad that I wasn’t in immediate danger of falling off, especially as the shulikun dragged it out of its gallop.  I flailed wildly, seizing hold of the girl’s ankle.  She was twisting around in turn, raising her makeshift weapon.  Not that it did much good.  She was still just a child and I was a full grown adult.  I gave her a good yank and threw her right off the horse’s back.

Beneath me, the dapple-gray stallion screamed in rage.  I could feel the vibration of its cry in my chest.  I sidled around, sliding myself further up its body until I could reach the mane.  I tangled my fingers into the coarse hair and pulled myself upright.  The horse attempted to buck or roll, but each time it moved in any one direction, the shulikun’s horses would dig in and pull it back into place.

The bridle was slender enough that I could roll it up and tuck it in my pocket.  I pulled it free and let it fall into shape.  The horse tossed its head, as if sensing what I held.

“My brother gave his flesh for this,” I snarled.  “Fitting, isn’t it, that you’d be ensnared by the very person you thought to enslave!”

And I dropped it over the stallion’s head.

Instantly, the horse’s struggles ceased.  It lowered its head, growing docile in a heartbeat.  I reached around its neck and took up the reins.  All around me, the shulikun loosened their tethers and then one brought his horse up alongside the stallion to pull the arrows free.  The stallion didn’t even twitch.  It stood as still as a statue with the bridle of flesh over its head.

“Remember to fulfill what you promised,” the lead shulikun yelled at me as the company formed up around him.  “There shall not be a sorrowful Christmas this year!”

I waved at them and they galloped off, quickly vanishing into the distance.  I had the horse.  Now to retrieve my niece.

And at that thought, she tackled me off the horse.

Look.  She had the element of surprise.

I caught one glimpse at her face as she straddled my prone form, her sharpened stick raised high and aimed at my throat.  Her lips were peeled back, her eyes were wide in frenzied desperation.  Her cheeks were gaunt and she barely looked human in that moment.

And before she could bring the weapon down on me, I swung a fist and hit her right on the jaw.

Yes, that’s right.  I punched a five year old.

She was knocked sideways.  She rolled and came up on all fours, poised, debating internally on whether to fight or flee.  Then the dapple-gray stallion spoke.  Its words came with an effort, as if it forced each one past the bridle, its voice pained and grating.

“Feast on her flesh, my child,” it said.  “This is what you were born to do.”

The girl’s indecision vanished.  Her feral rage evaporated, replaced with a calm focus.  And when she ran at me, the wild energy was gone from her movements, replaced with a fluid, deadly precision.  She snatched up a rock from the field in her hand and threw herself at me.

I couldn’t use my knife.  I couldn’t use *any* weapon, really, not if I wanted to avoid killing her.  I caught her at around chest-level instead, blocking her body with my arm.  She brought the rock down at my head, I jerked out of the way and it hit my shoulder instead.

Her feet planted against my gut, she grabbed hold of my arm, and then she *bit* me.  On the forehead, near the hairline.  And let me tell you, head wounds bleed a *lot.*  I shrieked in pain and threw her off of me and I felt the wound tear as her teeth ripped out a sizable chunk of flesh.  Blood poured down the side of my face and I instinctively squeezed one eye shut tight as the salt burned into it.

Stumbling with pain, disoriented by the shift in perspective, I failed to prepare for her next attack.  She hit me from behind, leaping onto my back and wrapping her skinny arms around my neck.  I felt her teeth bite down on the thick cord of muscle connecting the neck to the shoulders and I screamed in pain as she tore more flesh free.  I heard her swallow.

She was going to eat me alive if I didn’t do something.

So I let myself fall backwards.  I didn’t expect her to simply let me fall on her.  She was agile.  And as I expected, she hoisted herself up and over my head and shoulders, intending to land on my chest once my back hit the ground.

I grabbed her as we fell.  Seized her arms and locked them against her body and then rolled, putting her on the ground and me over top of her.

I am *still* a grown adult and she is *still* just a child.

She shrieked and struggled but with the full weight of my body I was able to hold her still.  My blood splattered on the ground next to her as I grimly held on, realizing that she wasn’t about to tire and I didn’t really have a good way to tie her up.

So I sat on her.  And while she flailed and bit at me, I called Bryan on my cellphone.

He showed up with the dogs and some rope and helped me tie up my niece.  For good measure I also gagged her with a handkerchief so she couldn’t bite me anymore.  I am now on a heavy dose of antibiotics and had to get my tetanus shot updated because of her.

Bryan took her to my house in his car so we could figure out what to do.  I rode the dapple-gray stallion back to the campground.  I made it walk slowly, clasping some wadded up gauze from a first aid kit Bryan keeps in his car to my forehead, trying to pretend that the blood loss really wasn’t that big of a deal.

The horse-eater was waiting at the edge of the woods when I reached the campground.  I directed the stallion over to it and painfully slid off its back.  The horse-eater extended one pale hand and I passed the reins to it, careful to avoid touching its thin fingers for no other reason than I wanted as little contact with it as possible.  The dapple-gray stallion remained subdued the entire time, as if it were nothing but an ordinary horse.

“This is a fine bridle,” the horse-eater said, inspecting it carefully.  “Good craftsmanship.  A price was paid for it.”

“Is our bargain concluded?” I snapped.  I wasn’t in the mood to discuss the harvester’s handiwork.

“Indeed it is.  My thanks, campground manager.  Should I come across you again, I will tear you in two and feed your entrails to my horse.”

Then it swung itself up onto the stallion.  I saw for a brief moment what was underneath its cloak.  A humanoid body, the limbs twisted oddly, bound in scraps of leather and metal.  Then the cloak settled around it again, as dark as night and encasing it in its shadowy form so that the only thing I could see of its features was the glowing red eye.

“You should have known you could not elude me forever,” the horse-eater hissed, patting the horse’s neck.  “But if you serve me well, I shall forgive your disobedience, and give you such a feast of flesh to sup upon.”

Then it kicked at the horse’s side and vanished back into the woods.

I really hope that feast of flesh isn’t going to be my campers when we reopen in the spring.

When I returned to the house I found that Bryan wasn’t there.  There was a text on my phone saying that he’d taken my niece to someone that might be able to help and I should just go on to the urgent care and get the bite wounds looked at.  He’d fill me in on the details of any arrangement when I got back.

And he did.  He was waiting at the house when I returned.  His dogs loitered on my furniture.  I’m not sure how my sofa managed to fit three of them at once, but somehow they made it work.

“Where’s my niece?” I asked, somewhat in a panic.

The reality of the situation was starting to sink in.  My niece had aged.  She’d tried to kill me and would likely try again as soon as we released her.  What on earth was I going to tell my brother?  Oh yes here’s your daughter she’s five now and her hobbies include horseback riding and murder.

But Bryan apparently had the same concerns and had made some decisions in my absence.  He’d taken her to the fairy.  The one with the deer.

They would take charge of the girl.  They would send her to live with their kind in the hills, until enough time had passed that she could be returned to her family once her age matched the timeline.

“You gave her to the fairies?!” I said, somewhat shrill from panic.

“Think about it, Kate,” Bryan snapped.  “She is five, maybe six, years older than she should be.  How are we going to make that work?”

We get away with faking the cause of death because the police department is on our side and that’s done before the death certificate is issued.  We don’t have a way to alter a birth certificate that’s already been filed.  Maybe it’s possible or maybe we could just… forge the child an identity… but the town doesn’t have the sort of people that know how to do that.  I sure don’t know how to go about it.  Furthermore, we were dealing with a cannibalistic feral child.  How did we rehab someone like that?  Sure, we’ve got a therapist in town, but she’s not nearly qualified for something like this.  Outside help would certainly attract attention.

He… had some very good points.

“I don’t know how I’m going to break the news to my brother,” I sighed.  I wanted to collapse on the sofa, but yanno, it was full of dog.

Bryan hesitated and when he spoke, he chose his words carefully.  I wouldn’t have to, he said.  The fairy had secured the help of a changeling.  I could take them to Tyler and his wife instead and when their real daughter was ready to leave the hills, the fairies would erase all memory of what had passed and it would be like nothing had ever happened.

It was… a horrible solution that he offered me.

Isn’t the illusion of happiness enough?  Why else was the idea of the child’s first Christmas so special, when it would mean nothing to the baby?  It was all for the parents.  So they could experience that joy.  Maybe I’m just a cold and cynical person and all the parents out there are going to yell at me in the comments, but I’m prepared for that.

There’s been enough messed up stuff in our lives that I wanted my brother to not experience this sort of heartbreak, even if his happiness was based entirely on a lie.  I told Bryan I’d take them the changeling.

Finally, I asked the question I was dreading.  How he’d managed to secure all this assistance.  I think I was hoping that the fairy was just being kind, on account of the relationship the two have.

“I made a deal with them,” he said wearily.  “One that I’m responsible for fulfilling.”

“Why did you do that?” I asked, my voice high with panic.  “That’s not your job!”

He whirled on me with uncharacteristic anger.

“Maybe I just wanted to save someone from having a fucked up childhood like we did!”

Before I could reply, he put his back to me and stalked away.  He paused at one point and I hesitated, wanting to call after him, to ask him what he meant by ‘we’, but he shook himself and kept going.  I stayed silent.

I found out what the price for the fairy’s help was the next day.  Bryan showed up to work without the dogs.  They were on loan, he said.  On loan until the fairy defeats his enemy.

I’m a campground manager and I’ve found the enemy of the horse-eater.  I can’t think of anything worse, because if the fairy is its enemy, then there’s only one identity that I can think of for the horse-eater.  The invaders of Ireland.  The ancient enemy of the fairies.

We’re dealing with a formorian.

And I gave it a horse. [\[x\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/)

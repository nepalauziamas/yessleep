This might sound absolutely absurd and paranoid but I'm fearing for my life. I didn't know where else to go. Excuse me if I make mistakes I am still shaking and my first language isn't english.

It all started when I was about 14 years old. At night I tend to open my window for a few hours so I get some fresh air before going to bed. I've always been kind of a night owl. I spent my nights playing games, watching let's plays or write stories at that time. I have also been a big fan of horror movies so my mom never believed me when I told her about what happens at night. I have been in countless scary and bizarre situations but these are other stories to tell another times. I wanna talk about this one thing that seemed to have followed me over the years.

One night while I was laying in bed playing on my phone I heard it for the first time. Really silent and I don't even know how I would have noticed it if my whole body wouldn't had begun to shake so hard. The slight whistle I thought was just the winds. I heard it qlmost every night from then on. It came out of nowhere but didn't seem to just disappear again.

I thought about all the things that might cause this sound. The wind? No, but maybe an animal? No animal makes sounds like that. Is someobe stalking me? Looking through my window whistling this silent lullaby? But I'm on the second floor and I never see anybody... What if it is the wind that blows through an obstacle that produces this sound? No. No obstacles could produce a melody like that on their own. It was almost as If the whistling was alive.

It grew louder and louder over the years. Or maybe whatever the sound made just... came closer. I learned to ignore it but for safety reasons I closed my window everytime I heard it.

I'm 19 now. I haven't heard it since I was about 17 years old anymore. It seemed to had stopped. I met my girlfriend during this time so I tend to spend most of my nights at her place. It's just a few hours away from m parents house.

I still hear and see unusual stuff in her house too at night. She claims me to be a medium or something. Like seeing the dead and things normal people couldn't. I would lie if I said I didn't belive in that kind of stuff I just don't belive that I'm in any way special and well I am diagnosed with borderline and my psychologist wanted to "test" me on being schizophrenic because of the things i tend to "see" and "hear" some nights when I fall asleep. I just think these are some wild nightmares and my brain seems to confuse them with reality since I love to watch a lot of hardcore horror movies. Sorry I got carried away.

So the mysterious whistling seemed to stop. Until last night. I was in the kitchen of my girlfriends parents preparing us a meal. I had just begun to cut a few carrots when my body tensed up and i felt my stomach turn. Infront of me was the big kitchen window which, at day time spends so much light, but at night only looked like a pitch black world with one lantern a few houses away. I saw it. This... this damn thing. It's not even a human. But it was dressed like one. It looked like it was wearing a long coat and a weird hat. And the damn whistling this... goddammit this horrible sound i haven't heard in so long. The knife fell out of my hand and it caught my girlfriends attention. Do you hear it? I asked her quietly. Before she could answer her little brother came running down the stairs asking if he could eat with us. When I looked back outside it was gone.

I calmed myself down saying that I was just tired and seeing things. It's not real... but what was that then - See about 20 minutes ago I was laying in bed with my girlfriend and something woke me up and I started looking around the room. I turned to hug my girlfriend hearing her breath louder than usually. I thought that it was cute until i noticed her actual breath. Silent and short. The other one came from behind me. It was someone else breathing... something else. I tried not to panic and hugged my girl tight as I could. Nothing would hurt her. Over my dead damn corpes would that thing touch her. I already had tears in my eyes when it slowly began to whistle. I jumped up screaming in tears while reaching for the light... nothing. There was nothing in the room. My girlfriend looked at me shocked. I thought about contacting my psychologist for a short second before she asked me "Did you hear it too?". I ran to the bathroom in shock, vomiting and hyperventilating. Now I'm sitting in bed next to my girlfriend while typing this. She made me a tea and now  is distracting herself with TikTok and seems to slowly forget about it.

I can't. Was this thing just looking for me all the time? And how did it find me now all of a sudden and why. What does it want from me?
I don't know what to do I need help.

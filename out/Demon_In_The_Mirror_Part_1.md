When I moved into my apartment back in 2018 my mother wanted to buy some things for my new place. (I’d already been living there about 5 months at the time) We went to this antique shop that sold both antiques as well as up to date items for a good bargain. I came across this black oval shaped mirror that can spin forward Or backwards. And from the moment I saw that mirror I knew I wanted it or so I thought.

my mother walked up to me and asked, “ You sure you want something like this”? I replied, “Yeah ma look how nice it is. Plus it matches the furniture I got. I just want everything to be color coordinated.” She replied back saying, “Well that’s you. I don’t like them type of mirrors in my house. They look real creepy.” I laughed at her a bit because my mom is like overly religious and sometimes can take things a little too far at times.

We went to check out and the gentleman who checked me out (I’ll never forget his name as long as I lived) Vladimir was too excited to sell the mirror. He said it had been sitting there 5 years and no one had bought it yet. My mom said that it kinda sounded strange and I said yeah that’s strange but, oh well it’s mine now. It was getting dark so I went and dropped my mom off then drove myself back home. My husband was working the night shift during the time so I was home alone until about 5am in the morning.

I put the mirror in my living room that night and I headed to bed early because I had to be up for work 6 am the next morning. As I fell I felt this God awful feeling I couldn’t shake. I ended up having this terrifying nightmare that seems like it was endless. I dreamed I was attacked by this demon With red eyes and teeth like a wolf. I woke up out of my sleep around 3am in a sweat. I laid there for a few minutes trying to collect my thoughts. When I finally got my thoughts together I walked across the hallway to the bathroom so I could wash my face and while in the process of that it sounded like I heard foot steps walking in my living room.

I walked out of the bathroom and down the hallway to my living room and was startle. M mirror had been slightly moved and was facing another direction. All I could think in my mind was, “What the fuck?” I knew where I put it and now it’s in a different location. I’m tired but not that damn tired. At this point because I had experienced a lot of crazy paranormal stuff in my life (read my stories) I said oh well and went back to bed. When I woke back up my husband had made it home from work and was up watching tv as I was getting dressed for work. He said, “Babe where you get this mirror from?” I replied, “Oh my momma got tha for me from the antique shop a few blocks down. He replied, ”Oh okay. It’s kinda nice you got it matching the furniture too so”. Yeah baby it is pretty nice.

Months had passed and I had given birth to my oldest son but also, I had been experiencing the crazy stuff happening in the house as I mentioned in the other stuff. I think everything was affecting my husband a little bit more than me because he wasn’t used to this like I was. But at the same time I didn’t want to be home just in case some real crazy shit popped off because I had a new baby and didn’t want anything to happen to him. I’d started staying with my mom for a few weeks and decided g to my house one weekend to spend time with my husband. When I got there my husband was sitting on the couch. He got up kissed me and we sat down talking. In mid conversation I stopped and said, “Hey whatcha doing with my jacket on the mirror?” He replied, “Oh babe let me tell you something. Since you been gone, even more crazier shit been happening here.” “Like what”? I asked. “Babe I swear it feel like that damn mirror is fucking watching me. And seems like it moves. You know I pay real close attention and detail to everything. I covered that mirror up because I don’t like the way I feel with it being in the hallway now. And the other night I walked past it and I could’ve swore I saw something in that damn mirror. The shits wild man.” I sat there for a moment taking in what he was saying.

My husband like to drink so sometimes I think his imagination can mess with him but, considering what’s happened in the house I’m aware it’s a big possibility for some crazy stuff to happen there. Boy I was in for some real horrific shit following the last few months of us living there. Things that you’d only read about in books or see on tv. You couldn’t even imagine the horror that was getting ready to hit my life because of this mirror. & the fact I believe the fate of others had something to do with the mirror….stay tuned for part 2

Hey guys, I've been telling my friend about some of the weird and horror story-esque things you'll see in the forests and fields of rural Ohio, and I thought that people here may find them interesting as well. 

To preface, you've probably never heard about any of these things. Ohio gets fairly little tourism as is, so obviously the big guys are going to try to keep things like this quiet. If you're not in Ohio, don't look these up. Don't search for them. Don't ask people about them. Don't even think about them outside these stories. It's too dangerous, as no one outside of Ohio is ever supposed to know about these happenings. 

I'll copy and paste the stories exactly as I told my friend so you can get the original experience. More and more of these are coming back to my memory every day and I'll tell some more tales of them if people are interested. In any case, thanks for reading.

This one has a fucking stupid name but people call them Weederbalks. I'm pretty sure the first guy to claim to see one was a landscaper for some rich guy and the balk part I don't know. 

Anyway, I've seen these things myself a few times. Shit my fucking pants when I did too. So when my friend and I, or sometimes just me, would hang out in these wooden structures that these Airsoft teens built for airsoft wars a while ago, we'd be pretty deep into the woods. My neighborhood wasn't too far from a huge area of woods so yeah.

We'd be hanging out and all of a sudden hear a sound that I really cannot describe too well. It was like a chicken clucking mixed with a smoker saying "whoop" so of course we're like what the fuck is that, and we look around. After a few seconds I look up into the trees and spot this fucking like 6 armed, skinny as hell and giant eyed thing. If I knew how to draw anything I'd try to show you, but I'm shit at art.

So of course I'm frozen, just staring at this thing, and my friend asks if I found something, not having turned to look at me yet. After I don't respond, he looks over and follows my line of sight. Second he sees the thing, he gasps, it makes that fucking sound again, and we take off. I assume it didn't follow us but it took a long time until we felt safe enough to enter those woods again. I've seen them a few other times outside of that but that was my first experience. There's even a scar on my ankle from getting caught on barbed wire that was left on the ground when we were running.

This next one I have my own name for because no one else I've asked has any idea what I'm talking about, but that's probably because I was like an hour and a half away from home because I was visiting my girlfriend who lived wayyy out in the middle of bumfuck. 

So, I was coming back home after seeing her so it was likely around 1:30 am. I'm driving on dead country roads and have to piss, and I see on google maps that I'm not far from a convenience store. I pull up to the store and park, my dad called me because they have apps to see where my sister and I are because y'know modern parents. He was wondering why I stopped, so I explained and then hung up, went inside, pissed, got a bag of dippin' dots and a \*REAL CANE SUGAR\* sprite and then paid and left. Keep in mind this is like the only building for miles. 

So I get back in my car and start getting gas, there's very little risk of like getting robbed out there because there's no one to do it, but I was still wary. As the pump, well, pumped, I was just watching my surroundings. 

That's when I see the corn stalks on the other side of the road, about a quarter of a mile down, start to move. 

Obviously I'm instantly in "What the fuck" mode and keep staring at the corn. Different stalks move along the side but nothing actually emerges for a while, so I'm like alright weird but whatever. I pay and get back in my car, pulling out onto the road and watching that area again as I pass by. 

Right as I'm reaching it I see what I can only describe as a really hairy 3(?) Fingered hand pull back into the stalks. Seeing this, I absentmindedly slammed on the breaks, luckily there wasn't anyone else driving at that time.

I sit there for a minute and nothing happens, my hazards are on in case someone comes by. Few minutes pass, nothing. So, this is was stupid, I know, but I turned off my lights and hazards and turned the car off, keeping the doors locked. 

I sit there and just keep staring, trying to prove to myself that I wasn't insane and didn't just imagine a hand. Not long after I turned off the car, maybe 30 seconds, the corn started to move. I'm both excited and terrified, but I keep watching. 

A hunched over humanoid looking thing walks out onto the road. Big yellow eyes, tiny pupils, skinny neck, basically clawed and hairy hands, again I couldn't tell how many fingers exactly. 

Its body reminded me of the jockeys from left 4 dead, but it was definitely taller. Maybe 6'5". I'm yet again shitting myself just watching this thing and it's walking towards my car, slowly.

Comes up to the window and just looks at me. The head wasn't like a monster or anything, the head shape was human and was just a bit larger than you'd expect. Large enough to be noticeable if you were paying attention. That's when I could see its face better, small mouth, nose bent and malformed, the eyes I already mentioned, but no eyelids. It didn't seem to have eyelids. So those big fucking yellow balls with tiny black specks just stared at me. 

Stared right into my eyes as I slowly reached for the key in the ignition and slowly turned it, slamming on the gas before the car even fully started. 

I kept checking my mirror all the way back to my house, which was about an hour from where I stopped. Never did I once see it again, but I'll always know it's out there. I've taken to calling it the Stalker because of the corn. It's a pun yeah, but also fitting.

Last one for today, Triflers. They're like those weird gnome sightings, except they're real. They seem to always travel in packs, likely because they're so small, but I don't exactly know what they do. They pretty much ignored me when I encountered them.

They have long hair, ratty and gross looking like a meth addict. I've only ever seen it as black or gray. Tiny fuckers, they're probably a bit bigger than a foot tall and have like stick thin bodies. My encounter with them was ALSO on the way back from seeing my ex, they had emerged from a different corn field and I saw them on the horizon. They were crossing the road as I was coming up, but they made it across before I was too close.

By the time I reached them, they were walking towards another field on the opposite side of the road, so I stopped and took out my maglite to see what the hell I was looking at. Thing has a far ass reach. I aimed the beam at them and they stopped and turned to look at me. Faces too small to make out at that distance, but I knew they were looking at me. After that I turned it off and got out of there. It wasn't like life threateningly scary, just weird, creepy and unnatural scary.

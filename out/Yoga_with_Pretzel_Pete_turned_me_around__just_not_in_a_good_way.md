I only agreed to take a damn yoga class to shut Jessie up. She was sick of hearing me moan about my stiff back.

“Oh for Christs’s sake, either stop moaning or do something about it, Bill.” She’d snapped, the night before I found Pretzel Pete’s ad.  “Every day you’re bitching about having a sore back, either make a change or suck it up and deal.”

I didn’t think my wife was being very fair. I’d already made plenty of changes. I’d got an ergonomic keyboard, mounted my three monitors at exactly eye level, even shelled out $1700 on a fancy office chair - one of those with top-tier adjustable lumbar support.

“Sit up straight, you’ll turn into Quasimodo all hunched over like that.”

The nagging comments every few hours while I tried to write new financial data ETL scripts in R and Python were a hint the posture correction investments had done nothing to help. If the remarks weren’t a clear enough clue, the fact the aching stiffness didn’t fade made it plain Jessie was right to pester me. I still had more work to do. That’s why Pretzel Pete’s ad on Facebook caught my eye.

“*PEOPLE ARE STIFF AND STRAIGHT LINES ARE BAD*

*PRETZEL PETE YOGA, YOGA, YOGA*

*PEOPLE ARE STIFF, PRETZEL PETE IS YOGA*

*BE NOT STIFF WITH PRETZEL PETE!”*

Well, my throbbing lower back was *one* reason the advert that popped up in my feed shortly after Jessie told me to stop bitching caught my attention. The other was the wording. The weirdness of the phrasing would have made me pause even if I wasn’t wincing my way through yet another evening.

“Damn Google’s listening to my phone again,” I muttered, clicking to read some of the comments. There were a few dozen. I hadn’t given yoga much thought – my plan had been to visit a chiropractor the next day (just to shut Jessie up, you know how it is). Yoga, as my cocked eyebrow revealed, wasn’t the *worst* idea though.

I surprised myself at how not-off-putting I found the broken English. The best yoga teachers aren’t from the U.S., I reasoned. Pretzel Pete’s grasp of the language wasn’t why I needed him, after all. I needed his ability to help me unstiffen my back. Which, according to the comments under the pictureless sponsored ad, he could do.

“I have never been more flexible – before I took Pretzel Pete’s class I couldn’t see my toes! Now I see them every day!” said Mary-Anne Louellen, from Ohio.

“One class with Pretzel Pete turned me around,” wrote Rick Harrison of NY City.

“I’d never done yoga, but because of Pretzel Pete I won’t have to again!” was the glowing endorsement from Idaho’s Stephanie Pratt.

“Sit up straight Bill, you were *literally* bitching about back pain *literally* only two minutes ago!” came the snapping reprimand from my wife Jessie on the couch.

“I’m going to go to a Yoga class tomorrow,” I muttered back, jotting down the address of Pretzel Pete’s studio from the ad and trying to ignore the excessive double-literally. “That’s *doing something* enough for you, yeah?”

I was taken aback when I whipped around expecting a snarky comment to see she was smiling. “Yeah, actually. Thanks for deciding to get up off your ass and do something about at least *one* of your problems.”

Then I remembered why I married her. As annoying as the nagging was, she was right. My back did *kill.* Plus, I *had* kind of got into lazy habits. I mumbled an apology for being a jerk, she said not to mention it, then told me to stop being a little bitch, and I went to bed in a huff. Marriage for you, right?

So, the next day I was aggressively compliant with my wife’s wishes and did exactly what she asked to spite her and prove a point. Because she thought I wouldn’t, and because I didn’t want her to have the satisfaction of being disappointed in me and proved right. I got in my shitty car and drove out to the random industrial district where Google Maps claimed Pretzel Pete’s studio was located.

To call the place run down would be an insult to every wrong side of the tracks in America. Every corner had its own mountain of trash bags, no dumpster came without a piss-soaked mattress slumped against it, and every square foot of the miles of graffiti contained some kind of threat or racial slur. There was space for 8 cars in the lot, six of which were full when I arrived. Every space had at least one pothole of a size just big enough to make parking a pain in the ass. 

Pretzel Pete’s studio didn’t have a sign, but I knew I'd found it because a gaggle of five nervous and slightly hunched people were making themselves busy holding yoga mats and being out of place in front of it. It was one of those corrugated iron buildings, the ones with smear-coated windows on the second floor and as little brickwork as possible to cut costs. Every bit of metal was rusted, every brick caked in soot. The door the gaggle was standing in front of was a fire escape by the looks of things. Blue once, but decades in the sun had bleached it a shade of *meh* that can’t really be described as a color.

Did I let this deter me? No. I figured it added to the authenticity. Pretzel Pete didn’t concern himself with appearances – his only focus was the yoga. I’d always been the kind of cynical guy that hates corporate fakeness and big-budget *anything.* The yoga studio Google Maps led me to was the furthest from marketing departments and branding you could get. A chance to put my money where my overly-principled-Twitter-mouth is. Pretzel Pete *is* yoga, right?

“Pretzel Pete’s yoga thing?” I hazarded at the group, all too aware that I didn’t think to borrow one of Jessie’s yoga mats. The five turned and nodded with the nervous unison of recently-acquainted middle-class people awaiting the start of an organized activity. A portly woman with a Karen Bob cut piped up.

"Yes it is, did you not bring a yoga mat?"

Even though she was a foot shorter than my shoulders she somehow managed to look down her nose at me. I tutted and rolled my eyes, but before I could mutter a sarcastic retort the *meh-*colored door swung open.

"Welcome, stiff people, to yoga, yoga, yoga."

The voice that drifted out the open doorway didn't have an accent I recognized. This filled me with a lot of confidence - Pretzel Pete was legit, the real deal, not some California-raised yuppie that self-styles as a mystic guru and moves Nutribullet products on Facebook as a side-hustle. Pete was probably short for some incredibly long Tibetan or Indian name I could never hope to pronounce. I was actually smiling to myself when I followed the squat Karen and her entourage into the shadowy warehouse studio.

The first thing I noticed was the smell. It was exactly the kind of smell you *wanted* from an authentic top-tier yoga experience, you know? Incenses and aromatherapy oils hung thick and cloying in the air. Earthy wafts of citrus hints and sharp herbal olfactory textures conjured images of mountains, pagodas, and temples - ancient practices passed down for thousands of years, monks meditating for days figuring out how to best fix a slipped disk, that whole deal. There was something else to the musk though, something I couldn't quite put my finger on. An undercurrent of sweet coppery tanginess, faint but not unnoticeable, that didn't quite belong.

The studio was dark. What daylight managed to fight through the grime on the high windows was quickly beaten into submission by the grey-purple incense fumes. There was *some* illumination in the shadowy space, but it was literally just enough to rescue the room from total blackness, the bare minimum requirement to meet the standard of "adequately lit". The only protection against full-on blindness were a few clusters of candles clumped at the bases of the four vertical girders supporting the distant ceiling.

Three of the four walls were bare from what I could see. The fourth, the one directly opposite the entrance, was hidden by a thick dark curtain whose color I couldn't quite make out in the shadows, but was definitely a darker shade of *meh* than the front door. This curtain twitched when the accentless voice chimed up once more.

"Deconstruct your floor mats, Pretzel Pete is yoga, you will be yoga in less than a long time."

I was starting to feel a little uncertain now, and not just because I didn't have a yoga mat. Glancing over my shoulder I saw there was a spot at the back, close to the door the Karen Bob woman had just closed behind her with authority like she was co-running the class. Opting to take the spot furthest from the front in the hopes Pretzel Pete wouldn't notice my lack of yoga mat from that angle is literally what saved my life. Well, that and my sweaty feet.

The other five, including the stout *Get-Me-The-Manager* woman, were unrolling their mats and getting into position, grinning at each other and making nervous small talk.

"It's my hips you see, they've been giving me grief ever since…"

"...and that shoulder still hasn't healed, so I was thinking 'hey, why not yoga'..."

"...my daughter gushes about it, started it during Lockdown, did I mention she just got into Yale…"

I looked at the polished concrete floor awkwardly, flappering my lips like a horse while my arms swung by my sides. I could feel Karen-Bob-Kathy glancing over her shoulder at me between brags about her daughter, and I tried my best to ignore it. I didn't have to try for very long though. The squat woman made eye contact with me and coughed to clear her throat, but before she could crack out a snide comment about my busted sneakers and lack of yoga mat, Pretzel Pete emerged from behind the curtain.

"Straight lines have no place here, it is now yoga, yoga, yoga. The shoes - past tense them, yes?"

I found myself kicking off my beat-up running shoes and pushing them into the darkness behind me, followed by my rolled-up socks. The rest of the class did the same, although there was less teenager-like throwing and more placing their footwear neatly by the sides of their yoga mats. 

I'd been feeling a little uncertain before Pretzel Pete emerged, but I'd been convincing myself once he showed up my insecurity would pass. It didn't. I'd had expectations about our mysterious instructor, and he met none of them. I don't really know what I'd imagined the man who emerged from behind the curtain would look like, but it definitely wasn't the figure that seemed to almost glide to the center of the space in front of our group. One look at him elevated my uncertainty to full-blown unease.

The first word that sprang to mind was "*height*". I'd once met a guy who was 7ft, had Marfan syndrome, you know. Had to crane your neck to talk to him. Looking up at Pretzel Pete's face hurt my neck way more than making eye contact with the previous tallest person I'd ever encountered. 

Pretzel Pete's height alone would have been jarring, but even if he'd been more of normal stature, his proportions would still be a bit unnerving. His torso was just a little too short, knees ever so slightly closer to the ankles than they should be, thighs far longer in comparison to the shins than on any legs I'd seen. 

The same offness was replicated in his arms. Stubby forearms dangled under elongated biceps, elbows, and wrists much closer neighbors than on any of the other bodies in the room. Not totally deformed, just the tiniest amount over the line dividing human body shapes and the uncanny valley. Enough to make me nervous but not run screaming.

God dammit, why didn't I run screaming?

Pretzel Pete surveyed the class with beady, sunken eyes, clapping his large long-fingered hands together. I couldn't see what color his irises were since he wore dark round glasses that bounced dangerously on his wide bald head when he moved. I could tell his pupils were big though, *real* big. He had one of the shortest noses I'd ever witnessed, but a narrow, almost conical chin that jutted out from his face at least 2-3 inches. When he smirked, his wet purplish lips revealed gapped teeth stained a tea-brown like those of a 20-a-day smoker.

"So, all found Pretzel Pete's invitation on the wires. Pretzel Pete is yoga, yoga, yoga, yes? Straight lines come here to die. Pretzel Pete is human, to human is yoga, to human is breathe. Breathe, humans."

Once more I found myself obeying the seemingly innocent instruction. My lungs filled with the blue-grey tickling of incense smoke and dusky warehouse air. I inhaled deeply, slowly, just like I saw the fake smiles in the yoga and mindfulness TikTok's Jessie watched do. Can you believe it, but I was thinking "*oh wow, this deep breathing crap must really work".* I felt almost light-headed as my ribcage rose and the fumes filled my senses. I've had a few hours to think about it and yeah, no shit, he'd drugged us from the moment we'd entered the room. I think he needed to make us more suggestible for whatever he did when he took the glasses off, to work.

I should have held my breath. I didn't have the gift of hindsight then though, did I? I just happily gulped lungfuls of the heady miasma, chalking my sudden calm down to the power of mindful breathing techniques I'd always been too dismissive of to bother trying. Truth is he had us from the moment we entered the room I reckon. The first breath of those thick fumes was enough to make us easily influenced. That's why nobody in our group of yoga novices disobeyed when Pretzel Pete said

"Vertically you are all wrong, be having closeness with the floor."

Somehow we understood what he meant, and as one sat down on your yoga mats (or, in my case, the polished concrete floor). Pretzel Pete towered over us, his loose skin looking almost purple through the flickering candlelight and free-will-dulling smoke. 

"Devices? Pockets? No. Shoes and screens are friends now. There are no pixels grand enough for yoga, yoga, yoga."

Once more the message was interpreted, and phones were tucked into shoes without question. I was compliant but let's make it clear, yeah, whatever was in those times did nothing to calm my nerves. Already I was getting the sense that something was very wrong, and judging by the nervous glances even Little Miss Speak-To-Your-Supervisor was throwing around, so were the rest of the group.

I'd been expecting an authentic yoga experience. I could tell I was having an authentic experience of *something*, but it wasn't yoga, yoga, yoga as was promised. I started feeling the hammer-thumps of panic in my chest when Pretzel Pete spoke once more and I realized I couldn't stand up.

"This is yoga, yoga, yoga. All humans are chosen, all are failed, none can adapt - you are rigid, inflexible, stiff. Pretzel Pete is here to fix, to punish, from beyond the stars. The Great J'kolth Ph'thilion watches at the heart of the universe. The irony is his demand. Pretzel Pete meets demand. This is yoga, yoga, yoga."

It wasn't the words he said that made me want to run. Yeah, they were definitely nonsensical and, again only in hindsight, foreboding, but it was the way he said them that pressed me more. His unplaceable accent wasn't the only disjointed element of his voice. I didn't notice it when he first spoke, it was so subtle that it took hearing him monotonously bark a few sentences for me to pick it up. "*The Great J'kolth Ph'thilion"* were the exact words on which I fully clocked it. After that it couldn't be ignored.

Pretzel Pete had two voices. Not like he said some words one way and others another. No. The rake-thin giant in his silvery robe spoke with two distinct voices *simultaneously,* as in *at the same time.* The second voice was almost drowned out by the first. Pretzel Pete's main voice was shrill, loud, but flat in tone and timbre. The second was a quiet almost inaudible whisper that piggybacked on his primary vocalizations. It wasn't flat or monotonous though. The voice I nearly hadn't noticed was a warm, sing-song pattering of syllables that would have been pleasant were it not for the fact it should have been impossible.

"I don't like this," Karen-Bob lady started saying, "I want to speak to the--"

Pretzel Pete cut her off mid-sentence not with a word, but with a movement. He removed his dark glasses.

The impact of his unworldly gaze was instantaneous, like a gut punch to the senses. I hadn't been able to see the color of his eyes before. Turns out I hadn't been missing out on anything. Pretzel Pete had no irises - just pearly thin rings of unblemished white marble surrounding ink-black pupils the size of a silver dollar. How the eyes looked wasn't important though. It's what he started doing with them that made all six of us start yelling and, in some cases, screaming in terrified confusion.

As soon as the heavily tinted lenses lifted from Pretzel Pete's face I could feel hands all over my body. Cold, clammy, and above all *totally invisible*, hands. OK, I'll fess up, I was one of the *"some cases"* that started screaming. Not for long though. None of us had much chance to express our sudden overwhelming sense of *"oh fuck no I'm getting out of here".* Pretzel Pete wanted to get down to business.

"The noise will stop, yes?"

The ethereal hands on my jaw pulled it shut, clamping my teeth together with sharp, spidery, unseen fingers. I could see the dents and imprints in my skin from them on my legs and arms when Pretzel Pete gestured and they pulled me to my feet. I knew the others were going through the same nightmare too, as I could see dozens of handprints across every exposed limb and torso. I could hear Karen-Bob-Kathy shrieking through lips pinched tight by a grip from icy fingertips nobody could see. Her indignant fury stopped when the hypnotic giant bent down almost double to bring his bottomless pupils to her eye level. He spoke once more, but this time his words were chillingly almost-sensical.

"This human is Monica Hilary-Brenton," Pretzel Pete said, his twin voices dancing around each other across every barked word. "It receives endorphins, generates pleasure, by exploiting workplace norms and chains of retail command to belittle those in low-paid commercial servitude. It has been inflexible, and wrong, and The Great J'kolth Ph'thilion has watched and found her befitting of punishment. It is time for yoga, yoga, yoga. I am Pretzel Pete."

I swear her screams are still ringing in my ears, despite the invisible hands keeping her jaw firmly shut. So are the cracks of her bones and scrapes of vertebrae sliding and crunching. To be fair, the spectral grip on my own face did almost nothing to silence my wailing, so the hands on the woman stood no chance. Difference is, I was screaming because I was so terrified I got flashes of black spots at the edges of my vision and my bladder had emptied. Monica Hilary-Brenton, AKA Karen Bob Kathy, was screaming in unrestrained agony. Agony I wish I didn't have a frame of reference to understand.

The words that came to mind by the time Pretzel Pete's invisible hands had finished with Monica the Manager Summoner were "snail shell". It started with her head, right? Her whole skull was pulled slowly backward until the air was cut through with the dull *pop pop pop* of her neck bones dislocating one by one. The bending didn't stop though, not until the tight bun on her scalp was pressed firmly into the small of her back. Her pleas now had to fight past a flattened throat as well as clamped jaw and lips. Dark red trickles pooled from her upside-down nostrils, and her shrewish condescending eyes were hilly with bulging purple capillaries.

Sadly for Monica, for all of us, Pretzel Pete was just getting started.

Monica was rolled backward in on herself, her bones scraping and sliding against each other, dull crunches audible even over the six clamped jawed screams. The twin *cracks* when her hips dislocated were followed almost immediately by a crescendo of wet-branch-underfoot-like snapping. This was from the invisible hands getting to work on her thighs - unseen fingers tactically breaking her femurs so the folding could continue. They did the same after moving past her knees to her shins. When they were done, the quivering lump that remained looked more like an oversized tube of rolled-up meat toothpaste than a human being. 

Somehow Karen-Bob Monica was alive, but barely. I couldn't hear her screaming anymore. She was whimpering, tears pooling from her shrewish once-spiteful eyes.

"Pretzel Pete has fixed the problem. Yoga, yoga, yoga is complete," the towering purple giant said, smirking down at the inverted once-woman, "the irony, oh the irony, the Great J'kolth Ph'thilion will surely be satisfied." With a flourish of his odd limbs, he turned from Monica, and as he did the red handprints across what could be seen of her flesh faded. He didn't put his sunglasses back on though. Nope, much to our horror, he swayed through the dark glistening pool of Karen blood to the next mat. 

"This one, Rusty O'Mulligan" he began, "draws pleasure, creates serotonin, from arguing with strangers on screens and devices, globally advancing its own inflexible ideology, perpetuating rigidity of thought…"

And so the process began again. Pretzel Pete finished his spiel and then bent near-double to bring his obsidian orbs down to the balding man's eye level. The word that came to mind by the time Pretzel Pete had done with the Keyboard Warrior was "*crab*". If he got out of there alive there was no way Rusty O'Mulligan was walking any way other than sideways again. Or lowering his arms, after what the prying wrenching invisible fingers did to his shoulder blades.

One by one Pretzel Pete worked through the group, twisting and flexing and breaking us into impossible angles for its god, or lord, or master, or whatever - The Great J'kolth Ph'thilion. He mentioned he'd come from beyond the stars but I'm trying to not think about that too much. Not yet, at least. Got to take it one step at a time, you know? I was the last up, which is probably why I'm still alive. Plenty of time to build up that sweat, and the amount I pissed my pants no doubt helped.

I've seen… fuck me, I've seen some *shit.*

The pylon-like starman read each of our sins aloud to the remaining group yet to be put through the "yoga, yoga, yoga" process. Always the judgments were only semi-sensical. Whatever this "*J'kolth Ph'thilion*" pulling Pretzel Pete's strings is, it doesn't understand human language so well. Or fucking irony for that fucking matter. The gist of Pretzel Pete's accusations was always clear though. Class member three was a bridezilla, victim four refused to speak to their parents over some trivial argument, and the last to get broken by invisible hands before I did had committed the cardinal sin of being a shitty boss. For that he got his neck turned around 180 degrees, and knees, elbows, toes, and fingers inverted joint-by-excruciatingly-slow-to-dislocate-joint.

Look, every one of us was clearly an asshole. I see that. All of us were "rigid" or "inflexible" or "stubborn" or whatever, and it made folk around us miserable. It's not *good,* BUT I don't think it warranted… well, Pretzel Pete's ironically twisted version of irony. Rebecca "*Bride from hell*" Bowman hadn't, I don't think, done anything that warranted her ankles being twisted outward until her shins snapped and her kneecaps shattered. Our punishments weren't ironic, despite how much our demonic yoga instructor from beyond the stars kept bleating about irony. It wasn't irony, it was just fucking insane. We didn't deserve it, and I will *die* on that hill.

By the time it got to my turn the shadowy studio was almost silent. Somehow the five others weren't dead, but they couldn't do more than gargle blood or let out the occasional bout of agonized whimpering. I really wish I had a better name for the man… the *thing* that glided toward me from Dirk "*mandatory unpaid overtime"* Dredger's yoga mat. Pretzel Pete makes him sound almost comical. There was nothing funny about that rattling breath - those limbs almost as long as my body that windmilled slowly as his invisible hands got to work.

"This one," he began, his wet lips peeling across quivering black gums as he grinned down at me, "is Bill Thistlethwaite. It is here because of its life partner, and the bending it will not do for her…"

And then Pretzel Pete spent a good few minutes explaining why my shitty, grumpy attitude around Jessie these past few years warranted what happened next. Do I think I deserved it? Fuck no. I mean yes, I do need to be kinder to my wife, I guess, but learning that lesson shouldn't leave me pissing into a catheter for the rest of my life. That's a huge overcorrection. Totally unnecessary. Oh, and I'm not going to tell you what Pretzel Pete told me about myself before he started pulling my legs further and further apart with this ethereal thousand-hand grip. I know your sympathy for me is already hanging by a thread. I didn't beat her or nothing like that though, just to make sure you're not getting *too* bad an impression. I've just not been an easy guy to live with, OK? A moody shitbag, but nothing to call the cops about - let alone twist my lower half fully round at the pelvis.

I don't remember much of what happened when he was doing it. It wasn't that those bottomless black marbles eroded my sense of self or anything like that. It just fucking *hurt*. I couldn't think of anything else but the pain. I wasn't aware of what he was doing or for how long, everything merged into a timeless blob of overwhelming sensory fire. It didn't stop hurting until long, long after too. I mean, it still fucking does, but at least my fibulas have started to set. Doctors couldn't reposition them properly, but they did the best they could. I'm still having to dictate this to a really handsome orderly, though.

Fuck, sorry, I'm getting *way* ahead of myself. You wanna know how I got out, huh? A combination of three things. First, the polished concrete floor was covered in blood. Second, I was barefoot and had sweaty feet as is due to being terrified, making them extra slippery. Third, I hadn't brought a yoga mat. 

And yeah, fourth, when I slipped midway through the yoga, yoga, yoga process I knocked over a candle and the curtain catching fire distracted Pretzel Pete. Not for too long - I could see him smirking at me from the doorway as I pulled myself across the parking lot with my one good arm - but long enough that his hypnotic hand spell broke. I mean, let's be real, if he'd wanted to bring me back and finish the job he could have. I think he and his master thought it was… fuck, thought it was *funnier* this way, the idea of me going back out into the world to tell the tale and get laughed at or branded a maniac. His twin voices were laughing, after all. Cackling and howling at me over the twenty minutes it took to drag myself out of the lot to the nearest street. Thank God that homeless guy knew where to find a payphone and call an ambulance. Took a while to get them to believe the phrase "*his head's on backward"* wasn't some kind of practical, but I can't say I blame the operator on that one. The doctors still can't work out how I'm still breathing. A big part of me wishes that I wasn't.

But yeah, my sweaty feet slipped on the wet polished concrete. His invisible hands twisted me into a position that had me on one leg and, well, gravity. Pretzel Pete doesn't understand humans well enough to notice I didn't have a yoga mat, it seemed. As for the candle and the curtain, well, that's something I'm going to have to unpack over several years. There was machinery behind those drapes, devices, and gadgets stretching from the floor to the ceiling. All of them were maddeningly complex to behold. Although I was focused on fighting through the pain and reaching the door while Pretzel Pete attended to the fire, I doubt I'd have been able to stomach looking at them for long. Especially not if the brief glimpse I got of that unspeakable abomination floating in the voice of space on one of the screens is anything to go by. At least the reveal of those vast otherworldly engines concealed behind the studio curtain settled the mystery of where the psychotropic incense came from, I guess.

The cops didn't believe me, despite the doctors being so baffled by my lack of dying that several hushed phone conversations have led to Feds in black suits peering round the door to my hospital room every so often. Jessie has agreed to stick by me, because *of course* she has. Some officers went to the warehouse. If you guessed that there was no sign of Pretzel Pete, his lunatic extraterrestrial machinery, or the five "*yoga, yoga, yoga*" students, ten points to Gryffindor. There *was* fire damage in the warehouse though, and all five have since apparently been reported missing. Let's level, if it wasn't for the fact they had to install a colostomy bag *on my lower back*, I'd be a suspect. I think the pigs have decided I've just lost the plot though - they're looking for a serial killer, one who does stuff so fucked up guys like me who survive would rather believe in "*wackadoodle shit like space aliens"*.

The doctors, nurses, and men in suits are a different story though. So is Oliver, the handsome orderly who agreed to type all this out while I dictate this and post it for me (because he's a really nice person). See, Oliver heard me telling my story to one of the Feds. He offered to get it online for a simple reason - he's seen Pretzel Pete's ad. He nearly went for it too, but the only reason he didn't is his boyfriend happens to also be a yoga instructor. The address had changed, but Oliver couldn't remember what to, and the ad had vanished from his feed. He did remember one thing, though. A name, from one of the comments, a bell that only rang as I was telling him everything he's been writing down.

Oliver remembers the comment and commenter clearly, because he remarked out loud to his yoga-teaching boyfriend how obvious paid-for are these days. 

"*Pretzel Pete made me really look at myself. 10/10 would yoga, yoga, yoga aga*in," wrote Monica Hilary-Brenton, on the day I arrived in the ER.

I'm having Oliver (who is handsome) help me write this and post it as a warning - if you see an ad for yoga lessons with Pretzel Pete, don't go. It means you've been targeted, and even if you've done pretty much nothing wrong like I have (or so I think but actually I sound like a bit of an asshole, Oliver didn't decide to also write) you will still meet judgment from Pretzel Pete by The "Great" J'kolth Ph'thilion's fucked-up sense of irony. I didn't know what I was getting myself in for, and now I'll never walk, feed myself, or even wipe my own ass again. That towering column of sneering purple malevolence with his thousands of spectral hands is still out there, somewhere. You've been given a heads-up. Don't waste it.

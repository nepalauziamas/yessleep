I’m a frequent bowler, very frequent in fact, and nothing tickles me more than when my local lanes fire up an old throwback: Cosmic Bowl. The nostalgia overwhelms me, and I know how dear it is for my dad. So, I go religiously every third Thursday for my dad’s sake so that we may roll together where it all started.

You see, back in the mid-90's, my dad was obsessed with this certain carpet pattern, the one you used to see in bowling alleys that dazzled the senses of both kids and adults alike under the black lights. Dad would take us, the whole family, there all the time, and although that particular carpet pattern could be seen elsewhere like movie theaters, jazz halls, and Chuck E. Cheeses, it was the bowling alley, it was *Cosmic Bowl* where it really came alive. My dad couldn’t get enough of it. Often, I’d see him staring down at the carpet as the thunder of balls smashing pins rang out around him. While others watched those crude mid-90’s animation of a pin getting what’s coming to it by the hands of a determined bowling ball, my dad watched the carpet with the same awe.

One day, and much to the consternation of my mom, he hired a carpet fitter to carpet every floor of the house with these dark, mesmerizing, neon carpets. Every floor. Just like that.

Us kids loved it. It never struck me as impulsive or weird to carpet the entire house like that. We thought it was awesome because cosmic bowling was the pinnacle of cool. We all had those plastic rolly squares scooter things with the four little wheels and complimentary neon pink color and got around the house by laying belly down so that we could be nose-close to the carpet. My tender boy eyes would dance across the bright squiggles and vague shapes. My five sisters were exactly the same. We would be scooting around at floor level dumbly chuckling to ourselves at the wonder of our carpet. Even our dogs and cats seemed a bit enamored by it by the way they obsessively tracked some invisible prey across it and how they rested so peacefully on it. 

My days were a blur, thinking back on it. I didn’t play many video games or watch much Nickelodeon or whatever the kids at school were always talking about. I just remember loving the house, loving the patterns on our floors.

Dad would almost never leave the ground, preferring to crawl and roll from room to room prattling off an endless stream of prayer and praise to the patterns. We'd often bump into him quite often and he'd hardly notice since he was rapidly deep-sniffing the rug between the words of his sermon like a bloodhound on the scent of an escaped prisoner. The same relentlessness was in his eyes.

Of course, mom did her best to keep the family off the floor, keep us fed, get us off to school and work, and in retrospect, I commend her efforts, but these were 1990's carpet patterns. This was *Cosmic Bowl* all the time. Even a mother’s love couldn’t compete with that.

Eventually, she succumbed to the carpeting, rolling along with dad and us. That’s when dad got ambitious. Mom was the last piece of the puzzle. The patterns were there to guide him, guide us. He didn't stop at the floors, no, he contracted that carpet fitter to come out and carpet our walls and ceilings, our countertops, upholstery, furniture, cover our beds and dressers, toilet, bath. Anything that didn't need to be moved around was covered in this hypnotically wonderful carpet.

I remember hugging the floor trying to stay out of sight as my dad angrily commanded the carpet fitter, who, evidently, didn’t feel it necessary to carpet so much of the house. My dad crouched low to the ground, delivering searing words to the carpet fitter until he eventually acquiesced. I never wanted to provoke my dad’s ire like that, so I stayed good, I stayed close to the carpet and the patterns.

Luckily after everything was covered in the patterns befitting a true *Cosmic Bow*l, we were free to stand and hug the walls and walk like normal folk again, while never needing to be more than an inch or so away from the carpet.

Dad reveled in it. He urged my sisters and I to focus on certain patterns in certain rooms and look for the Cosmic language. He sang to us, guided us, set us on the right path. His ululations echoed throughout our home at nearly all hours.

Patterns coalescence for me just as my dad said it would if I remained pious and loyal to the patterns, to the *Cosmic language* in those neon squiggles. My dad’s bizarre orating became clearer and clearer. Our house was to be the nexus of a coming, a catalyst for change.

My dad knew. He knew before the first carpet was installed. He knew from the first moment he set foot in the *Cosmic Bowl*. He knew before any of us were even born

Our neon home. His church. His altar.

My dad chose me as the *Cosmic Bowl* chose him.

My sisters and mother experienced the will of the *Cosmic patterns*, so drawn were they to the language, so engulfed in the squiggles and shapes, so utterly enraptured by the touch and feel. One by one, and to my dad’s elation, the will of the *Cosmic Bowl* was made clear.

First, however, was one of the dogs. She had been spending a lot of time in the mudroom standing perfectly still, perfectly transfixed. Was I supposed to have witnessed what I witnessed? Was it the will of the patterns, some sort of instinct, or an unseen influence of my dad’s? Whatever drew me to her, I padded quietly within her view, and remained as hidden as I could.

She shook, vibrated, but never yelped with fear. All at once, her fur sloughed off and diffused into the carpet, then her neon pink and yellow flesh and fat. All of it melted off of her and was greedily sucked into the floor. All that remained were her fluorescent bones and horrible silence. I dared not move. This was something dad needed to handle since dad knew all the answers, since dad was provided all the answers in the patterns. Paralyzed and morbidly curious, I watched on as the bones of my beloved pet compressed and melded together, collapsing into a perfect pin.

It was over and I let out a shaky breath. As soon as I felt compelled to get up and pick up the pin, my dad wrapped his gangly arm around my shoulders and pressed his all-too-smooth face against mine. He felt cool to the touch. He whispered in an unbroken stream of consciousness while rubbing the carpet right in front of my nose. The patterns spoke to me, translated for him.

“Is it beautiful? Remain devoted, son.”

My dad crawled to the *Cosmic Pin* like a four-legged centipede, somersaulting to grab it when he got close. Ignoring me, he took the pin to the kitchen table and set it down.

There it remained as the patterns in the carpet took each pet, then each sister, then my mother of the course of the next year. I was there to witness them all. It was as if I had to. It was as if without me there, it would have never happened. I was some sort of catalyst. It was just as the enigmatic sermons of my dad described.

The worst part wasn’t seeing the flesh stripped from my sisters and mother, nor was it how I could never bring myself to interfere and prevent it. The worst part was the gleeful acceptance of their fate. The *Cosmic* patterns had foretold their fate, ingrained it within their brains, and made them believe there was new life as a bowling pin.

I watched them. I watched all their bones contort and compress. My pets, my sisters, and mother. *Ten Cosmic Pins.*

My dad favored me, his only son.

The last pin was placed on the kitchen table, my mother, and my dad turned to me with glossy eyes. He told me to grab five of the pins as he scooped up the others. In all the time, I had never touched one of the pins. I had always been too guilty and intensely fearful of the wrath of my dad or the Cosmic pattern.

Holding them in my hands and that moment, however, my fear dissolved like their flesh. They were still there. They were still them, but just different, ascended. That one was Meredith. This one was Emily. Another was Jessica. I was able to recognize them by touch. The patterns were preserving them.

Dad led me away from the kitchen and through a corridor I had never noticed before. My dad saw on my face that I was surprised by its existence and flashed me a mischievous smile. Further and further I followed him into my all of a sudden labyrinthine home bathed in dark twilight and intense neon squiggles and shapes. My dad sang at full volume some sort of new hymn that triggered a warmth in my sisters and mother.

At long last, my home opened up into a large hall. A cool glow coming from a CRT screen naturally blended into the black lights and *Cosmic* patterns. It was a bowling alley, one with a single lane, one that belonged to our family, was created for our family.

I wanted to question how, but it all became clear as the patterns in the carpet shifted to show me. This was *Cosmic Bowl*, the true *Cosmic Bowl*.

I didn’t know what to say to my dad. Words were useless anyway. His body, too, was beginning its metamorphosis into an extension of the *Cosmic* will.

Now, he is the ball, a glorious one at that, crashing into my family endlessly by my hand in this new *Cosmos*.

I am devoted to *Cosmic Bowling*, and when I take my dad with me every third Thursday of the month, I know others will take notice. Others will begin to see things in the patterns at their feet. Others will find divine lanes in their homes as well, and when they do, dad will be so proud.

"Boss, we've calmed the kid. He's down the hall." Lui, a Frenchman I hired a while back, informed me.

"Right, right, thank you." I winced, dressing my wounds. It was difficult differentiating between old and new ones.

Two henchmen nodded as I entered the guest room. Luis, the runaway slugger, drummed his fingers along his notorious bat in one corner.

"Luis, some privacy." I stated, waving dismissively.

"Cocky, aren't ya?" The kid snorted. "You know what I am, yet you send away your lifeline?"

"Which one are ya?" I asked, doing my best to mask my fear. The jello in my legs made that challenging.

"Why should I tell you?" The kid countered, defiantly.

"A small fry, ey? Damn. I'd be in trouble if you were a real demon!" I boasted, projecting false bravado. I knew that this nobody demon could rip me limb from limb… it wanted nothing more.

"My name is El Demonio Negro!" He snapped, flashing rows of pearly whites. My blood still speckled them. My shoulder throbbed at the reminder.

"Never hearda ya." I tensed to resist trembling, already regretting what came next.

A pale gray mask materialized across the kid's face, then lunged at me.

The shark demon nearly hit its mark, instead getting a mouthful of Azy's finger. Too late did it realize, as it began sawing its teeth into the invincible finger. Like nails on chalkboard the teeth screeched, grinding down to nubs.

"You think you're a big fish, ey? Sorry. You're just used to a small pond." I kept pushing. Even as my bladder threatened to give in, I held out. This time, he snapped.

Webbed hands sliced into my forearms, down to the bone. "I don't care anymore, you're dead!"

I stared death straight in the eye. Sure, I had succeeded in breaking my tormentors, but at what cost?

Before the demon could complete the deed, an orange blur appeared between us.

"Why are you SO difficult?!" Azazel demanded, towering over me. *Was Azy always this tall?*

The shark demon froze, a hair's breadth from collision.

"Oh lord, thank you. Long time no see, Azzhole… oop!" I yelped, realizing what I had said. Azy reached out and snapped my forearm, unamused. Luckily, I'd gotten used to this sort of pain. I simply grit my teeth and stared Azazel down.

As much as my instincts screamed to turn tail and run, I was finally face to face with one of my captors. I had to keep going or I'd lose this opportunity. 

"Do not disrespect your superiors. New. Rule." Azazel declared, an evil grin across their orange mask. "Have you finally learned your lesson?"

"No, he has not. He still shows compassion. And is an insufferable jackass." The shark spat, vitriol and hatred dripping from every word.

"Please for the love of everything holy and unholy. Follow the damned rules!" Azy pleaded.

"Understood, your orangeness" I said, struggling to breathe. On the one hand, Azazel had shown me kindness, giving me a finger. On the other hand, Azazel was royally pissed. An aura, both icy and warm, radiated from Azazel. For the first time I saw true hell. Azazel removed that orange mask and revealed to me what hell truly meant.

*That* was lights out for me.



I awoke in bed, my real one. Though my body was repaired, my mind was still ablaze. Adrenaline had left me mentally exhausted, and what I saw behind that mask left me utterly sick. I turned and threw up, until all that came up was stomach acid. I was in hell, sure, but I hadn't seen it until that point.

Now, to you folks tagging along through my wild ride, I have a tip. If you find yourself trapped in hell, piss the demons off enough and they'll kick ya out.



"Sean, have you ever stayed after hours?" I slapped my hands down on his desk.

Unflinching, the well dressed man snorted. "Why on earth would I?"

"You can go to hell," I said, not intending for it to sound like that.

"Yeah well, you're a real piece of work yourself." Sean grunted, scowling at me.

"No, like, literally. I mean you *go* to hell." I clarified, sounding a bit unhinged.

"Maybe that's where Pualy ended up, then?" Sean asked sincerely, but quickly returned to work.

"Wait what, Pauly's missing?"

"Is this some sort of repeat after me game, because I'm not having fun. Why are you even bothering me?"

"New assignment. We have to take the story from one Miss Vapors. Special rules for this one."

Sean groaned, a sentiment I shared.



"The snakes are real. Close your eyes." I read aloud. "Turn to stone, make her cry. Compliment her hair, or you shall dye."

"Pretty straightforward." Sean stated bluntly.

"No not d-i-e, d-y-e. This is… weird?" I shrugged, unsure how to make heads or tails of that.

CRICK!

A steady flow of blood began to drip from Sean's lips. I watched the unphased man as beads of blood magically rolled down his suit, not being absorbed.

*Something struck a nerve… shit what did I say?*

"Quit gawking, what else?" Sean ordered, white knuckling the wheel.

"Right, sorry. Beware Lilith, for here she lies."

"Ughh" Sean groaned. "Lilith's here?!"

"It could be a diff-" I tried, getting cut off.

"The is only *one* Lilith." Sean sounded more defeated than I'd ever heard him. In fact, more human than I'd ever heard.

"Look man, I'm sorry. I never meant to make your life more difficult. I'll do better, I swear." I offered an apology, attempting to make amends.

Sean gave a pained chuckle, an empty laugh. "You're so much like him."

Silence fell over the car for a couple miles, until he continued.

"I had a brother, Josh. Always gave people the benefit of the doubt, real optimist." He said, lip trembling. "That's what got him, in the end." His lip froze, frowning. 

"My condolences, I'm so sorry." I stuttered, unsure how to navigate this.

"So am I. I wish he hadn't believed in me, maybe he'd still be here." Sean swallowed dryly.

"Look man, I spent nearly a decade as a mob boss. I lost dozens of good-er well, decent men. Do you know what they all had in common?" I stared ahead, melancholy biting at my heart.

"What?" Sean finally asked, after another moment of silence.

"They died for what they believed in. Your brother put his faith in you. He loved you, so don't hate yourself." I gave a pat on his shoulder, half expecting a slap or punch.

Instead, maps informed us we had arrived.

I took the lead, keeping my ears open as we ventured through the overgrown brush. The woods were far too quiet, no tracks, droppings, or anything.

*Hissss… sisss…* hissing and slithering came from every direction.

"We're surrounded." I whispered, closing my eyes.

Smooth, firm platelike tendrils began coiling up my legs. Breathing quickly became impossible as my torso was constricted tighter and tighter. 

Something warm flicked the inside of my ear, followed by a *HISSS* directly in the ear.

I couldn't recoil, I was completely immobilized. I couldn't even flex my muscles, I was far too tightly restrained.

"A new one… kekeke" dank breath sent my neck hair on end. I shivered slightly, as much as I could in my confinement. "Hah! Seanie!!" She burst out, sounding like your standard California college girl, five coffees deep.

With a deep sigh, Sean said "hi Lily." The dread in his voice was palpable.

*So many new sides of Sean today!*

"Couldn't resist all thissss?" Lilith hissed, still hyper. "Cmonnn open open open! I'm pouting with puppy eyes!" She whined.

*SCHICK!* Behind me, a loud sucking sound exploded. I kept my eyes shut.

"Ha! Gotcha! Sean, you can close them. Sean? Sean!" Lilith laughed, then quickly devolved into cries.

I'm lucky my mouth was covered, otherwise I could have easily broken Azazel's rule.

The cries quickly turned to ugly sobs, as Lilith broke out into violent tears. The next instant, a loud *CH-CH-CH* of something shattering, boomed behind me.

"Yaaawn!" I cried, muffled by my restraints.

"Quit your yelling, idiot! I'm fine." Sean scolded, though I didn't take the angry tone too personally.



This post is getting kinda lengthy, I'll fill you folks in on Miss Vapors in the next post. For now, take care. Remember, piss off demons enough, you'll get out of hell.

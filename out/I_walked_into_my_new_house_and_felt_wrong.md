 I just moved out of my parent's house and found a small house in my hometown for a reasonable price. I felt overjoyed, considering housing in my area is usually very expensive. The previous homeowners felt very rushed to get out of the house, in fact even leaving furniture in the house. I clearly didn't mind it, being a young kid fresh out of high school. I walked into the house and felt a weird chill down my spine. I thought nothing of it and just thought I happened to get a chill then. The house was very cold, unusually cold. I walked into the bedroom to unpack some stuff, and as I went into the closet, I found bats.

Lots of bats. I felt a little creeped out but kept pushing forward. I found an old piece of clothing, it looked like it was from the 1800s. Weird, considering that the house was only built in the 1980s. I really felt weirded out, but was already locked in to buy the place. I walked into the bathroom. And there, I found my greatest horror.

I heard something talking to me. It told me that it hadn't found a guest in years. I ran out of the bathroom and went to a friend's to get internet since I didn't have any installed at my house yet. I searched up the history of the land that my new house sat on. I learned that in the 1910s, a Victorian-style home from the 1880s had burned down on that same plot of land. I walked back into the bathroom as soon as I got home. I told the spirit or whatever was in there that I was there to help them rest. It screamed at me that it never ended. All of a sudden I felt my body heat up intensely. I ran to my car and to the hospital. My body temperature was 118.4 degrees Fahrenheit.

I got my body temperature back down to normal and went home. The spirit talked to me again. I identified that it was a boy. He told me, "Welcome to my hell. You're stuck here now." I tried to run out the door. I couldn't run out. I opened the door and I found another door. He materialized into a human body. "I've been stuck here for 100 years. I've seen wars here. I've seen peace here. And none of my family remembers me. Wanna be like that?" he said. I ran out the window. I ran to my parents' house and stayed there for a week. I told them everything, but of course, they didn't believe me.

I am at my parent's house now. I have not gone back to the house, and I am getting it appraised for a sale next week. My parents criticized the decision, but it's what's best for me. If I were you, I wouldn't buy it. [Please, if you are in the market for a house in my area, donâ€™t buy it.](https://reddit.com/r/itscontho)

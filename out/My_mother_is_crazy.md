I’m bringing this up now because of some other personal matters in my life, but the bottom line is, it all follows back to her. 

Since the day I was born I’d say. I was premature because my mom was a smoker and she was also 17. When I was about 3 days old my heart stopped beating while my parents were in court fighting my grandmother over a custody battle. My grandmother told the judge she needed to leave to deal with me while my mother sat there and did nothing. The judge then decided I should be in my grandmothers care. All throughout ages of 1-5 y/o were a haze. I don’t remember much especially not involving my parents. 

When I was 5 is when I can recall the first incident. My grandfather had recently passed away so I was sent to be with my parents for the weekend. To give my grandmother some time to herself. Everything was going alright. I had 2 siblings, a brother and a sister. The sleeping arrangements were that me and my sister would be in my parents room, and my brother would be in another room by himself. Us three children go to bed, but I wanna say around 10:45 I woke up. And I remember trying to pretend I was asleep because I wasn’t supposed to be awake and I’d probably get spanked if they knew I was awake. I heard my parents arguing. My dad wanted sexual relations with my mom, but she kept saying “no, I’m not in the mood I’m going to bed” so my dad started arguing with her. Asking her about her cheating and saying that if she can sleep with someone else, she can sleep with him because it’s only fair. It just keeps going back and forth until I notice my dad is trying to force himself onto my mom. She then tries to fight her way out of it, but he fights back. Some pretty serious domestic violence situation. The cops were called. He ran. The police said because I witnessed a domestic violence situation, I had to get counseling… at 5 years old? In order to get me to talk they’d just ask me over and over again what happened basically forcing me to remember even though my brain just wanted to forget. 

When I was 6 we (me and my 2 siblings)were sent to stay with my mom and her new boyfriend for the summer. They were living with one of my moms friends. At some point, her friend moved out, but my mom, us 3, and her boyfriend did not. My
Mom had no job, was paying no bills, had no means of transportation, and still had us 3. Then we found ourselves in an even worse living situation with dog feces, there was just a concrete floor with no carpet to walk on and it was snowing outside. We couldn’t really take baths or showers. And all 5 of us were sharing one bedroom. 

After my mom was kicked out of there, she kind of just dropped us off at my grandmothers house and said she was going to Virginia with her boyfriend for a funeral. She didn’t come back for months and we were moved to 2 different households in the few months that she was gone. By the time she did come back, I was almost 8, My grandmother was remarried, we were about to move into a new house, and then my dad committed suicide.

My mom was around at this time but she was just kind of living off of other people. Used EBT for food, didn’t work, didn’t pay rent or bills, didn’t buy her children anything. Everything up until I was like 13 is a blur. My siblings started acting out and getting in trouble because my mom would coach them into saying my grandparents were abusing them, when it was her. She’s tell them she had this huge an to get us all back, that she was working, saving up money, looking for her own place, her own car, when she wasn’t doing anything. She’d get our hopes up and we’d get let down. She used to call use names. Things such as window licker, the light person, der-der-der, retard, stupid, melon dome. She’d make fun of everything we did or she’d try to compete with us. She’d throw things in her children’s face and say her reason was because “we did it first”. She’d call me a whore. She’d go around and tell people things like “I’m asking to get hit” or “I’m ruining my life” and she’d throw knives and forks at doors. She’d throw food at people if she was mad. She said her best form of torture for children was to beat them with a bag of oranges becaus the orange peels would absorb the bruise? She definitely did try it. Or a coin sock. She’d whip us with wet towels, belts, shoes, hangers, spoons, or anything she had in her hand. She’d spit in peoples faces, wipe boogers on us, sometimes tied our hands together with zip ties. If we stole or lied, she’d smack us and give us busted lips, but my mother is one of the biggest thief’s and liars I’ve ever met. 

When I was 16 she admitted she had RELAPSED pretty badly on coke, but it was interesting because she had never informed me before that she had done it to have a relapse. After that, I reported her to dfs, she doesn’t really see any of us at all. She still doesnt have her own place, has no car, and is still on drugs. I’m 20…

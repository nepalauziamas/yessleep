I awoke to darkness, which itself wasn’t surprising, since I had fallen asleep just as the sun was going down. What *was* surprising, what was vaguely disconcerting, was the nature of the darkness—its apparent *density*, its widespread occupation of my (ordinarily) ambiently-lit living room. I had fallen asleep on my couch, facing away from the TV—which I’d left on, turned to some dead channel—but upon waking my endarkened vision showed the ceiling; a dim circle the only evidence of the ceiling fan thereon. Something had drawn me out of my dreamless sleep and caused me to half-turn in the process of waking, as if I’d been called. Something had snuffed out the lights of the various devices throughout the open space, replacing them with an almost preternatural darkness.  

In any other situation, I would’ve just gotten up, turned on the lights, and done a little investigating; perhaps finding that I had been awakened by a forgotten alarm, or some louder-than-usual sound from one of the tenants above or below me. But lying there, staring up at the canvas of black that was my ceiling, I felt it absolutely imperative that I not get up, that I not even turn my gaze away from the barely discernible fan. The immediacy and severity of this feeling, this disinclination to do anything but lie there, was itself alarming. I listened, the thought coming to me that someone had broken in and my body was simply responding to its primal programming of predator-avoidance, but I heard nothing; that is, nothing unusual. There were only the typical sounds of apartment living, most of which I had grown accustomed to months ago.  

Still, anxiety took hold within me, a small panic mounting as my mind failed to reconcile the feeling of vulnerability with the lack of evidence for a hostile presence. My physical senses told me nothing, and yet instinct, intuition, and whatever else constitutes more abstract sensory perception told me that I was in danger; that there was *something* very near, something that would, upon noticing my activity, inflict unthinkable violence upon me.  

Seconds passed, minutes, and I eventually realized that I was feeling unwell. It began as a sensation not entirely dissimilar to indigestion, but then quickly retweaked itself so that it manifested as something more cardiac. I felt my heart flutter and pound within my chest, and I sensed—somehow, in this hyper-aware state—my body grow more vascular; the veins pressing against my skin as if the blood flowing through them had developed a fluidic sentience and wanted out.  

This alarming feeling waned a little after a few tension-filled moments, but again evolved into a new sensation, this time localized entirely within my head. A migraine, sudden and fierce, came to me; and had I not been so utterly terrified of detection I would’ve cried out and rolled onto the floor. Instead, as subtly as I could, I buried the back of my head into the couch cushion as if I could somehow grind out the pain; all the while keeping my eyes trained on that featureless swathe of black above. Something was happening to me, a process that almost felt like some highly invasive probing, or upwards-traveling scan; an increasingly uncomfortable evaluation of my physiology.  

When the migraine subsided, and I was left a sweating, tremulous mess, I decided that I could not mentally withstand another episode like that. With immeasurably slow movements, I inched my head so that by pressing my eyes to the very edge of their sockets, I could gaze toward the coffee table, which sat between the couch and the TV. But even these minute and glacially undertaken motions had drawn the attention of previously unseen thing.  

Just when my right eye caught sight of it, it rose from its perch on the coffee table—rearing up in malignant glory amidst the fulsome darkness.  

I managed to flick my eyes away immediately, but I had seen it, and in doing so had brought its full attention upon me. The subsequent feeling of dread, the sheer, implacable terror that then came to me...the most demon-haunted, phobia-filled nightmares can scarcely compare to that single, short-lived instance of monstrous clarity. It was as if I had gazed upon Satan himself, orating before his undivine legions at Pandemonium.  

With my face turned back toward the ceiling, I stared fixedly as one petrified by a Medusean gaze, rendered entirely still in my inexpressible terror. And I not only sensed the thing looking at me, observing me with its demonian and inscrutable gaze, but felt on a deep, spiritual level its close presence—the titanic inhumanity of it. Had there been others there with me, I’m sure they would’ve felt the same. Such a loathsome and deeply supernatural thing could not exist amongst the sane and mundane without effecting them in some way. It emanated evil.  

I don’t know how much time passed before I lost it. Maybe seconds, maybe hours. One moment, I was lying there, steeped in darkness, my body pitifully failing to maintain any worthwhile degree of homeostasis in the presence of this ultra-heinous entity. And the next, I was screaming, crying, spurting and babbling hysterically, insensibly, like a coat-restrained lunatic shrieking in some black asylum. I just couldn’t take it anymore, my mind not equipped to handle being in the proximity of something so existentially inimical to human nature.  

What silenced me, what curbed my madness and has kept me incurably awake since, was not the bite or claw mark of some pit-escaped fiend. I was not *attacked*—not in a way I can reasonably, accurately articulate. At what could’ve been the height of—or a dip in—my mania, a subtle yet profoundly terrifying thing happened:  

**My ceiling blinked.**  

In a moment of acute, mind-collapsing despair, I realized that I had not been staring at my ceiling fan. The thing that I’d mistaken for it was actually an *eye*, black and massive, into which I’d been desperately staring for hours; as if in its tenebrous lens I’d find salvation from the lesser nightmare perched beside me.  

An instinctual glance—a knee-jerk reaction of fear—rightward showed the unwholesome, gargoylean horror still there on the coffee table, but only then did I realize that it was *joined* with the coffee table; and it joined with the carpet, and the TV behind them both, and everything else minimally observable in the essentially lightless room.  

The room was so dark not because of some unprecedently dark night, but because something had covered the walls and floors so totally, that it simply appeared that way. I was not enshrouded, but *encased;* bottled up inside something larger than life, blacker than space. For hours, I had lain awake in the maw, gullet, or bowels of some immense, Stygian life-form.  

The cessation of my screams marked the (thankfully temporary) implosion of my mind. i did not move or even blink for hours, until finally, for reasons unknowable to me, the thing receded into whatever void or dimensional abscess it had come from; and light, arriving not long after, filled the room, returning a faint sense of normalcy the world. But the dread remained, my despair lingered; the horror of that omnipresent affront to sanity remained within the forefront of my psyche, keeping me dumb and paralyzed.  

I had always enjoyed sleep. I looked forward to it pretty much from the moment I began my day. But now, having seen what happens during the hours when the mind and body are at their most vulnerable, when reality is, for whatever reason, *malleable*, I don’t think I’ll ever again look forward to the advent of night. Now, I dread it. I have no notions left of sanity. I no longer hold any illusions about personal safety. Eldritch, obscene things can, on a whim, enter into our reality and unravel our minds—and there is nothing we can do about it.

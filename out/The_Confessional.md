“Forgive me Father, for I have sinned.”

From the moment the man entered the confessional across from me, the air became thick.  It was almost like smoke.  The old wood of the confessional groaned.  I wondered, is this what it was always going to be like?  This man would mark the first confession I would ever hear as a priest.

“It has been twenty years since my last confession.”

I expected a range of time between confessions.  Some people came every week, some once in a blue moon.  And some, like the leather-voiced man obscured by the screen, only came when something extraordinary occurred.

“Go on, my son.”  My voice sounded like a child’s compared to his.  I always hated the high, lilted tone of my voice.  I could have tried to speak deeper.  But I had a feeling this man would know if I pretended.

He took in a breath.  “This is completely confidential, right?  You can’t call the cops on me?”

I felt my pulse quicken.  “As long as you confess your sins, you are forgiven.  Nothing leaves the confessional but our bodies.”

He sighed.  “I am...I am not a good man, Father.  I have made many mistakes.  No...not mistakes.  I did it all on purpose.  But I didn’t think it mattered.”

“Are you a religious man?” I asked him, confident in the answer.

“I never thought I was.  My mom, she was into all this catholic stuff.  Went to church every Sunday.  Made us pray before meals.  My dad thought it was idiotic and I guess I shared that sentiment.  Church was boring and I have never done well with boredom.  I get into trouble when I’m bored.”  He paused.  “And I’m bored too often.”

“Tell me more.”  I moved the rosary between my fingers.

“When I was a kid, I started setting fires.  Little ones at first.  Just a match in a trashcan or burning the edges of a book.  The problem is - I liked it too much.  It was way better than praying, I can tell you that.  Better than sex.  Better than the weed my friends smoked.  Fire is...calming.  It eats everything it comes across.  It erases it.  The things I burn just cease to be.”

“And why did you want them to cease to be?” I knew I was doing this wrong.  I was supposed to be a priest not a therapist.

He gave a short laugh.  “I don’t know.  I just like being in control of what exists and what doesn't.”

The air was still thick and I tried to avoid coughing.  Even though he couldn’t see me, I wanted this man’s respect.  I think it was necessary if I was going to help him.  

“It wasn’t long before I moved on to burning bigger things.  The shed in my neighbor’s yard, an old barn on the outskirts of town.  The bigger the structure the better.  I would find a place to hide so I could watch it until the blaze was all gone.  No one was hurt at first.  But then…” he trailed off.

I let the moment of silence stretch on between us.  I would never be able to see his face, but I imagined it was filled with a combination of guilt and pride.

“I accidentally burned down a shack with a man inside.”  He took a deep breath.  “He was homeless, squatting in the shack for the night.  I didn’t know he was there.  But as I watched the structure burn, I could hear him scream.  He woke up too late.  The fire consumed him just like the shack.  Even his screams were swallowed up by the smoke.”

“How did this make you feel?”  I knew the answer before he spoke. 

“Excited,” he whispered.  “It was better than anything I’d done before.”

I didn’t feel qualified to save this man’s soul.  He was supposed to confess to me and be absolved.  What was my role in that?

“And you came here to repent for killing this man?”

“Oh no,” he laughed, filling the confessional with the chuckle of a murderer.  “I killed him years ago.  Since then many others have succumbed to my fire.  Men, women…children.  Fire doesn’t discriminate.  It consumes all.”

He spoke of fire as a religious man speaks of God.

“Then why are you here?”  Maybe I was being too forward.  This was my first official confession, after all.  Maybe I was doing this all wrong.

He took a breath.  “I had my eyes on this blue suburban on top of a hill.  It was such a sickeningly perfect little house.  A mom and dad, two kids.  A white fucking fence and everything.”

“Language, please,” I implored him, feeling my stomach turn.

“Yeah, sorry Father.  Anyway, I knew I wanted to burn it all down.  There was a garage in the front where I could set the fire.  I scouted out a place a ways away for me to watch.  It was going to scratch that itch.  I snuck into the garage and did my job.  The fire burnt strong and bright.  I slipped out again just as quickly, heading to my spot.  I waited.  The fire should have started lighting the whole house up within moments, but nothing happened.  I stood there for too long, doubting myself.  Maybe it fizzled out?  I would try again the next day.”

“And did you?” Being in the presence of a murderer was terrifying, even if I had the screen between us.  What was to stop him from lighting the confessional aflame?

“I did.  I came back the next day and lit a fire every bigger than the day before.  Smoke filled the garage.  I got out just in time to get to my hiding spot.  I sat there, staring at this house, for hours.  And nothing.  I saw no smoke, no fire.  No fire trucks were called, no sirens.  It was silent.  I KNOW I started that fire.  At the very least it should have alerted the family.”

“So the house…”

“Yes.  It refused to burn.”

I could hear the anger in his voice.  What had once been a calm-if-unsettling energy turned seething.  

He pressed his hands against the wood.  “The next day I tried everything.  Kerosine, gasoline, alcohol.  I used fucking matches just to see if it would do anything.  Nothing took.  It was infuriating.”

I did not mention language this time.  “So you came here for resolution?”

“I came here for answers.”  He was yelling now.  I tried to slow my breathing but I knew he could sense my fear.  “I broke their front window, crawled into that house, doused myself in gasoline, and lit myself on fire.  And here I am.  Nothing.  The family didn’t even acknowledge me.  It was like I didn’t exist.  My fire, the thing I love, the only thing I love, couldn’t touch them.  I screamed at them.  I cursed them.  I broke anything I could reach.  And they…they just went about their lives.  They walked around me but did not respond to me.  I was a ghost in that house.”

“Maybe this house is a symbol of your guilt.”

This just made him angrier.  “Are you saying I’m lying?  It exists!  The house exists!  But it won’t burn!  And if it won’t burn, then how will it be consumed?  How will I matter?”

He punched right through the screen between us and his fist nearly reached my chin.  I crawled to the very back of the booth.  He took his fist back, cradling it.  “I’m sorry, Father.  It’s not your fault.  I thought maybe god could help me.  Give me meaning again.  But this house took everything from me.  That family took everything from me.  If I can’t destroy it, I will become it.  I am going back to the house and will stay there until I either kill or die.  The two of us cannot exist at the same time.”

“If you do not repent, I will have to call the police.  You cannot harm those people.”

“Those aren’t people, Father.  People die.  They burn and scream and melt.  I know people.  Those aren’t people.” 

I gathered my courage and finally looked at him through the hole in the screen.  This man was covered in burns.  He was naked, his skin blistered and black.  He had no hair or lips.  He had one eye with which he stared at me.  Inside me.

“I’m going to the house now,” he said, standing up.  “I won’t be back.”

I heard the door open and he was gone.  The air cleared and I could breathe normally again.  Other than the hole in the screen I had to wonder if he had even been there at all.  

I realized as I sat there, body still buzzing, that I had never felt fear like I did in this booth.  

I left the confessional.  I would hear no other confessions that day.  Without ceremony I went to the priest’s rooms.  I walked in and sighed deeply.  “This is not what I thought it would be like,” I said, taking my robes off and hanging them up.  I slipped off the rosary, feeling it between my fingers.  “How did you do this for so long?”

The dead body of the priest lay sprawled on the floor, his eyes missing and his tongue cut.  I smiled for the first time since entering the confessional.  “Guess I’ll never know, huh?”

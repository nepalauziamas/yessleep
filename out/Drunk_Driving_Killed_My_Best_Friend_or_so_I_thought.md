I’m a senior in high school, about to graduate. I thought my senior year would be perfect, but it’s been the exact opposite. I’ve been haunted with something now for the entire school year. 
Before I get into this story, I want to say that this is a really dark story, and it’s very personal. 
Last summer, my boyfriend, Carlos, took me on a date. After our date, we went to a party and got totally shitfaced. We were so drunk, we couldn’t walk straight. You know, drunk people make dumb choices. 

Carlos urged me to get in his car, so we could drive to another party. “It’ll be fine Brit..what are you ‘fraid of? All I’m gonna do is drive ‘long the edge of town, there’ll be no cops this time of night.” 
I really had no other options. Looking back, I should’ve called a friend, I should’ve called an Uber, ANYTHING else would’ve saved me that night. But between Carlos’s pressuring me to ride with him and my drunken thoughts, I stumbled along with him to his car.

“You’d better drive careful, dumbass.” I said. I was feeling a bit more lucid, having drank less than Carlos, but he was still taking swigs from a large bottle of vodka.  
“Relax, Brittney, you’re not my mom.” 
So, Carlos started driving out of town. As soon as he was on the road, he slammed on the gas and we shot down the road, peaking over 80 miles an hour. He just kept picking up speed. 84…85..87…91.
“Carlos! Slow down!” 

But Carlos didn’t listen to me, he kept up at his high speeds, rounding a corner, as he did something streaked across the road. I screamed to Carlos as he swerved the vehicle, and a loud impact shot through my head.

It was hard to miss as the car jerked into the haze in front of us dropped under the car, splattering something dark and stinky across the vehicle hood, and onto the windshield. It spread across the entire car. “Carlos! For the love of god, slow down!

Carlos breaked hard at the sight of his windows splattered with an oozing dark evil…blood.

We sat in the car in total shock. I immediately got out. I wish I hadn’t.
When I got out, all I could see was a smeared darkness across the road..blood. At the very end of the smear, almost 50 yards back, was a girl. A young girl. Her body, lifeless on the cold tar road. She was dead, and her body was mutilated from the impact. I ran over, feeling sick as I stumbled around. I began to cry and helplessly yell. “Someone! Anyone! Help me!” 

By the time I got to the body, I recognized her. A shock was sent through my entire body. It was one of my best friends, Joyce. She was the sweetest girl in school, always smiling and laughing. Now, she was dead. I couldn’t move my body seeing her like this. Her face was stuck in an expression of fear, and seeing her like that was an image I will never forget. I suddenly felt dizzy, like my whole world was spinning out of control, spinning spinning spinning, followed by darkness as I passed out.

When I came to, Carlos was wiping blood up with the shirts in his gym bag, and his trunk was open. “Oh my god. Britney. Help. We gotta clean this up, we gotta-we gotta get rid of her.” I snapped up. “Carlos. We-you…we just murdered my best friend!” “Exactly, Brittney, we just f**king murdered someone! That’s why we have to get rid of her.” I began to cry helplessly. “Brit, we can’t tell anyone bout this. Sooner or later she’ll come up missing and we can blend right in.” He grabbed my face hard and forced a kiss into my lips. I pushed him away hard and knelt back down by Joyce. “Okay,” I sobbed. “We’ll do it.” 

Of course I didn’t want to, but I was afraid. Stupid ass excuse, but I tried to reason with myself. So, we dropped Joyce,into the lake nearby, burnt the bloody shirts, and swore to secrecy.
I should’ve never done any of this.

It’s been almost a year since, and I am haunted by Joyce’s face everywhere, smiling with the word missing above her head. But one day, in January, something impossible happened. 

I was sitting in history class when an announcement blared; calling me to the office. When I got there, my body froze. “What the f**k? This is..this is impossible. Holy shit.” 
Standing in front of me…
was Joyce.

I think she’s back to get me.

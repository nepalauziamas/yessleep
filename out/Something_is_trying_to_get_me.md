Sorry, I get that the title is probably very vague. But I really don't know how else I could describe what's been going on. 

(For context, I'm a 16 yr old girl who lives in a small town in Alberta.)

I should start by saying I'm very spiritual, so I belive in entity's, energies, demons, angels ect. And because of this I think it's safe to say I've had my share of paranormal encounters. Some casual some frightening. But nothing as fucking terrifying as this. 

I think it's important to know that my town is right next to reserve. Atwell as lots and lots of wooded areas and abandoned property. And it's not un common that people have claimed to have seen skin walkers. It's not to terrible uncommon to hear things like laughing coming from the woods (if you live near them). Or see coyotes or dear either looking odd or walking on there hind legs.

I guess I should probably actually explain what's been going on now. 

A few days ago, me and my friend were walking back to my house, and the trail we were taking was a gravel road that lead down a  winding down wards hill, surrounded by trees, and the odd abandoned property. And as we were walking I noticed something I'd never seen before,  it was what looked to be an old barn that was abandoned. This intrigued me and my friend as to us this looked to be the perfect spot to smoke, drink, ect. And immediately decided to make plans to do so there within the bear future. 

Fast forward two days, me and my friend are hanging out at my house and we decide we are gonna steal some of my mom's vodka and go explore this old barn. Excited, the two of us start to get ready to go. And just as I'm packing a small bag of essentials to take with us, I notice something in wrong. Like really wrong. 

I don't really know how to describe it, other then as the worst I've ever felt. There was just this plunging, sickening awful feeling that wafted over my whole body, causing my anxiety to rise. 

I turned to my friend and asked if he felt it too. He said he did and we quickly decided to grab some incense and cleanse a little before we left. 

I did so, and for a second I felt relief wash over me as the feeling went away. Only for it to come rushing back a second later. 

Not even a minute later, me and my friend are trying to find other ways to cleanse when suddenly we here noises, movement, coming from outside my window, like movement and some wheezing. (My rooms on the second story, there's a slanted roof just underneath it) .

Panicked my friend tells me to shut the window, I rush over and quickly shut it. I also go to lock it but suddenly my lock won't shut. I've never had issues locking it before this point. But suddenly it was extremely hard to use. After a few seconds of frantic panic I manage to lock it. 

We then backed up from the window, and just sat on my floor trying to figure out what were gonna do. We obviously decided we are NOT going to the barn tonight. 

As we're sitting on the floor, making protection sigil and spell jars, I remeber that feeling only seemed to have happened when we spoke about the barn. I told my friend about this and decided there's something out there that definitely doesn't want us near that barn. 

We probably spent another hour, cleansing my room. The feeling was still there, as was the odd knocking or muffled noise from outside. We tried everything, sage, incense, sigil, protection spells, herbs, crystals, music, affirmations. Only after an hour of doing all of those did the feeling start to cease. 


I'd like to say that this whole thing is over and I've moved on. But unfortunately, that is not the case. 

Last night, I asked my younger brother (he's 11) if he could keep his window shut for the next few nights. I didn't want to tell him why as I didn't want him to be scared. But the next few words out of his mouth scared the fuck outta me. 

He then told me that he was planning to, as just that night after I'd fallen asleep he was still awake and could hear wheezing and shuffling coming from outside his window. He then told me after he heard the noises he got up and went and stood in the hall way and noticed that my window had been flung open, and that noises were then coming from my bedroom and were now louder. 

That was last night he told me this, so naturally i spent about twenty minutes cleansing the fuck out of my room, and he's. 

As I was doing that last night, I also decide to make some protection runes. So I made one, drew it on a piece of paper, and stuck it to my window. 

I was talking to my friend the phone while doing so, and I started to explain the whole barn story when suddenly the feeling came rushing back and the protection sigil paper went flying from my window. 

I know how this sounds, I know I sound like a paranoid teenager who's just scared herself. And I know a feeling isn't really something to be a afraid of. But there's something really fucking wrong. Whenever I'm by myself in the house the feeling comes back and I feel like I'm being watched. When ever I start to cleanse there's always this strong energy pulling me to stop. I don't know what to do. 

Now for the reason I made this post. Like in a God damn horror movie my mom's gonna be out of town for the next three days, leaving me and my brother home alone by ourselves for that time. 

My mom leaves tonight, and after she leaves I'll be throughly cleansing my whole God damn house. 

Depending if anything even happens I'll be updating. 

(Also so sorry for all the writing errors, I'm writing this at school and it's rather rushed)

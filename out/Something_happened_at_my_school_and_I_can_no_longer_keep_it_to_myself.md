For once in my life, things had started going for the better. I finally uttered enough courage to make friends at my new school. I didn't make many, but I still managed to make the acquaintance of two of the students that I regularly saw. Marcus and Lenny. 

You see, my life isn't so good but it isn't so bad either. I was adopted when I was 4 by this newlywed couple. My now father was a strange man. He kept to himself mostly but would never let any harm befall me or my mother. My mother was like any wife who had just gotten their first child, ecstatic and most certainly afraid of the looks she would get by the other mothers in town. We weren't like a TV show where we lived happily, but I never once felt like my parents hated me.

"Your exams are coming up James, did you study?", my mother asked.

"Yes, I did."

That was a lie. I would stay up all night reading comics or playing online games.

"Good. I also want to meet those friends of yours that you told me about. They sound like such great people." She continued, with a warm smile.

"I'll tell them you said that."

My father wasn't as enthusiastic as my mother. 

"Do not fail your exams." He said with a monotonous voice. 

He seems cold but when I got an A for my science test, he was the one who was the happiest.

"Well, it's like they say, 'lower your expectations and you'll never be disappointed'."

"My expectations are that you pass all of them. It matters not if you get even the worst pass, you must pass."

That would be the last conversation I would have with them. My mother never finding out what happened and my father never being able to see me fail.

I went to school. Like any high schooler, I met up with my friends at our lockers and had a chat with them.

"Hey man, did you check out the new trailer for the game?" Asked Marcus.

"Nah man, my mom told me to do the dishes and I was so tired that I slept the moment I was done." Replied Lenny.

"Hey guys how's it going?" I greeted them.

"Oh hey James, I'm doing fine. I don't really know about Len over there." Marcus said while tugging Lenny's shoulder.

"Ah, yeah I'm fine." Lenny said after averting his gaze from something.

He was staring at Sarah. A girl he had a crush on. I mean, it wasn't that hard to notice. He always looked her way but never said a word about it.

The bell rang soon after. We went to our classes and everything seemed to be going like any other Wednesday. Mr. Page shouting at the people sleeping in class. I always found it funny that his parents named him Page, almost like they knew he would become a teacher.

As he was about to hit Brian, an athlete who never got enough sleep due to his rigorous training and him staying up all night actually studying, an announcement from the speaker could be heard.

"ALL STUDENTS AND TEACHERS, REMAIN CALM AND CLOSE ALL WINDOW BLINDS. THIS IS NOT A DRILL. DO NOT LOOK OUT OF THE WINDOWS UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE"

I was obviously spooked by this.

"Why would the speaker tell us to close the blinds to all windows?"

While I was too busy asking myself questions, my classmates closed the blinds to the windows and Mr. Page even locked the doors.

We all sat in our chairs, waiting for another announcement. After what felt like hours, which was actually just 17 minutes, another hum of the speaker could be heard. This time, it was more muffled than anything but I could make out a few words.

"Students----stay-----side------room-----no one------inside-----out-------sight"

What did it mean? The words were so inaudible that I wondered if it really was our principal speaking on the other end of the speaker.

He said "out" and "sight". He must have meant to say "stay out of sight". I whispered that to everyone and they all started to sneak around the room to places they thought they could hide.

Which of course, wasn't enough.

The lights went out. I hid in the closet at the back of the class. No one wanted to hide in it because they thought it'd be the most obvious hiding spot but I panicked and went straight inside. After a while, I heard no more sounds coming from the classroom.

BANG


BANG 


BANG

I heard something run into the lockers outside my classroom. All of my classmates were shocked by the sudden loud nise while Mr. Page tried to calm them down.

Our door shook.

It's there.

It's right in front of our door.

Trying to get in.

I started sobbing quietly. Realizing that I was done for. My life was going to be stripped from me.

It finally made it through the door. It's appearance was sickening. It's lower body reminiscent of a scorpion. Legs and pincers ready to slice anything in half. It's upper body was almost human with flimsy arms. I'd even say it was if not for the face looking like it was mutilated the day before, just starting to rot. 

The next moments were filled with screams. My classmates being cut up one by one. Finally, it's head cracked to where I was. The closet. It slowly made it's way to me, almost like it was savoring the moment. Right as it was about to stab the closet, Mr. Page hit it with a fire extinguisher.

His final act of bravery, maybe out of fear or wanting to save at least someone, allowed me to quietly exit the closet and sneak out of the class. 

I wandered the halls of my school, seeing every room covered in blood and the corpses of the people attending school that day. Be them student or not. 

When I went down the stairs, what do I see other than Sarah's head. On the ground, with one last look of terror in her eyes. If I could find Len, I can't imagine what I could have told him. That I found the severed head of the person he saw his future with on the ground in a stairway.

I nearly cried at the thought of it. In the end, I prayed that all the victims were in a better place and moved on to the entrance.

There, I saw another one of those monsters. But this time it was different. It was eating something. When I got a closer look, I noticed an orange sweater. Only Len would be so stupid to wear a sweater during the summer.

I accidentally stepped on a phone causing it to crack.

_FUCK_

It heard me. I know it did because it instantly turned around and rand towards me. As it drew closer, three gunshots entered it's skull.

I never mentioned this but our school had a pistol in the principal's office for "safety reasons" Someone must've taken it.

I didn't look to see who shot it. I just darted through the entrance. The sun was so bright. I turned around to see Marcus.... standing there....smiling at me....

That was the last thing I remember seeing. I woke up in some sort of hospital bed. With a person asking me how I was feeling. I couldn't help it, I had to ask.

"What happened at my school? What happened to my friends? What were those things? What happened to my parents?"

The woman sighed and told me that everything was going to be alright. 

But I knew.

I knew what I saw.

I knew it was real.

If it wasn't, then what happened to my school?

I have to find an answer, no. I WILL.

I will find out what happened. I will find out what those monsters are.


_And they will suffer._

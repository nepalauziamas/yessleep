Dear Reader,

Christmas Eve has always had a special place in my heart. The children go to bed early and the streets become empty. There isn’t a light on for miles and often you can stare out into the stars. 

That actually isn’t the reason at all why I enjoy it, but I figured that if I painted a warm and cozy scene you might forget for a brief moment that the majority of my research focuses on the supernatural. 

The actual reason that I enjoy Christmas Eve is because the veil between worlds often is lifted early to begin celebrating the mingling of souls, and that means a chance to observe paranormal occurrences is heightened. 

Is this odd? Quite likely, but then again, I don’t recall asking your opinion either.

Most people who worked for Thorton and Hewley likely never knew how eccentric or outlandish their CEO was. 

Jessica Aleland wasn’t so lucky. She ran a catering company in the area and the law office decided to hire her for a Christmas Eve party a few years back. For Jessica she thought it would be easy money. 

“There were a lot of people there, from all around the entire city. I guess I never realized how many people worked for Mister Dalen.” 

For the event, Dalen had requested a variety of dishes. None of them seemed particularly festive.  But I knew it was common for a lot of people to forget the reason for the season. 

Jessica said she made only five of the dishes on the list given that she had been hired at such short notice. 

“I didn’t know this at the time, but I was basically sloppy seconds. All the other bigger caterers had already been called and refused. I wish I had known what they knew about Dalen and his company.”

When she got there to the party, most of the law firm was already drunk. 

Dalen was requesting that the main dishes be served at the sixth floor conference room and Jessica had her hands full. It really didn’t surprise me to realize that she had no idea what was actually going on there. 

My research has found that this particular law office was well known for another reason though. Mister Dalen had an extremely morbid fascination with the occult. Perhaps it might have even rivaled mine. 

And before Jessica arrived that evening, the head of the company had requested that all of his senior executives gather at the conference room and begin a supernatural ritual to contact the dead. 

Yes, Dalen wanted them to perform a seance. 

He had even hired a medium to make sure the ritual went off without a hitch. 

Jessica meanwhile, was walking into this shadowy conference room offering eggnog and warm roast beef unaware of the fact that her world was about to change forever. 

As you may or may not be aware, tampering with the unnatural order of the astral plane is dangerous. Especially if you don’t know what you are doing. 

The medium hired was only a two year novice, having mostly gained fame from local small towns proclaiming details about missing persons and long lost husbands. The stories were accurate, the ghosts always told the truth. But this sort of seance was something entirely new to her. 
And the ritual did not go as planned. 

There was a shudder that shook the entire company. Some claimed it was an earthquake. But I’ve checked records. No seismic activity could be found that day. 

What happened over the next few hours though, can’t be argued by anyone who lived nearby. 

The lawyers suddenly became extremely violent toward each other. 

Jessica said that she was about to serve Mister Dalen a slice of meatloaf when he started to foam at the mouth. 

“His eyes rolled back and he sounded like he was possessed.” It didn’t take a stretch of the imagination to realize that was precisely what was happening. 

He and his entire board of directors had unwittingly unleashed a swarm of angry spirits. 

The power went out shortly after this and these well dressed businessmen turned on each other without hesitation, using everything within reaching distance as a weapon. 

Jessica showed me a wound where Dalen actually bit her arm and described to me in detail how others used chairs and fire extinguishers to bash at one another. 

“I stumbled toward the back of the room where that damned medium was trying to escape and demanded she help me. She grabbed my hand and we crawled through the carnage.”

When they reached the elevator, the two of them were attacked one last time by an accountant. He was spitting angry toxic fire from his eyes and mouth, every trace of his human appearance melting away. The ghost wanted one final victim. 

The medium said that she invoked a binding spell, a last ditch attempt to stop the evil spectral force. 

Somehow it worked. They rode to the ground floor and ran to find the nearest phone to contact the police. 

By the time authorities had arrived though, all of the people in the building had finished slaughtering one another. 

“I came to retrieve my items for my company. It was horrendous. Eyes were scattered on the floor, people mutilated from fingernails, spine tissue dangling on stairs. I’ve never seen such carnage before.” 

I believe there is more to this story than just a warning of tampering with the unknown. These spirits were angry for a reason. 

A brief look into the accounting books of the company have told me what may be the answer. 

“The company purchased an entire city not long back. It had fallen on hard times and they needed money. But they didn’t take into account an old curse that hadn’t been lifted,” the medium told me. 

In case you hadn’t realized, she was the same person who assisted me to know what befell Simon and Raoul. 

It was occurring to me that the ghost stories I thought may not be connected, actually had a deeper meaning to one another. The answer was there at Harbor Bay. 

Dark forces seem to have a habit of circling the area. They even follow me. Perhaps because of all that I have uncovered. 

But still I must know more. 

I guess you know where I will be spending Christmas. 

If I make it until then I mean.

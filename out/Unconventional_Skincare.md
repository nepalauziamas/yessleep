7:00 AM.

My alarm clock flashes the time at me in bright red intervals. 

7:00 AM.

7:01 AM. 

7:02 AM. 

Being late for work is not an option. I toss the comforter and top sheet off of my body and slide my feet into my slippers. The room has a slight chill - a good time to wear my new robe. 

I don’t want to disturb Chloe, my Persian, laying at the end of my bed. I quietly make my way to the bathroom and turn on the vanity lighting. The chill is stronger in the bathroom, and the mirror starts to fog as the warm shower water runs. No way was I going to work without a shower to start my day.

My skin looks slightly dry and lifeless. Maybe a face mask would cure that, just for the day. Vitamin C might perk me up a little. I smear it on with the tips of my fingers, waiting for it to settle into my skin. I only wait for about five minutes before I hop in the shower and wash it away. 

My hair feels rejuvenated, and my skin looks less sickly. Adding my normal serums and lotion to my face, I look refreshed and ready for the work day. Face masks really can be so beneficial. 

Self care is something I indulge in frequently. Taking care of yourself is important. You want to look like your best self every day. Hair, clothes, skin - it must be nourished. At home facials are great, but professionals usually know how to do it better.

My work day ends at 5:30 PM after I finish up my reports and send them to Greg. I’ve reported to Greg for about three months, and I’m lucky I do. He values my time as much as I do. I always leave the office at 5:30. No later, no earlier. I always schedule my appointments at 6. 

Along with my vitamin C facial from this morning, I also stacked that with a blood rejuvenation treatment in the evening. It seems like a new facial practice. Apparently the Kardashians partake in it. They have nice skin so I figured why not try it? And guess what, it worked on me just as well as it does on the Kardashians (if not better). I’ll have to find a way to do this at home, despite my esthetician telling me there isn’t a safe way. I’m crafty. I know I’ll figure it out.

Kelly, the secretary on the floor I work on, has amazing skin, but only because she’s young. I believe she’s about 23 years old compared to my 29, and unfortunately my age shows a lot more than I’d prefer. I wonder if she will be free for drinks sometime soon. I want to know her secret. 

Turns out, she was free on Friday, so we had our cocktails and talked for a while. Unfortunately, the next day, she didn’t show up for her shift. Alcohol poisoning perhaps? I couldn’t be sure. She seemed fine at my place when she had her drinks, but that wasn’t exactly my issue.

I do have some issues with vanity and my ego. Because of my extensive self care routines, I do have a strong confidence. Putting work into myself means that I look my best at all times, and because of some new tactics I’m trying, I’ve never looked younger. That blood rejuvenation mask really has helped me out. 

Kelly wasn’t the only girl to disappear on us. The front desk lady at my apartment complex, Jill, also disappeared. What a shame, too. She was also quite young, with only 22 years under her belt. It would be devastating to not show my beauty to everyone every day. I worry about the future, for when I get older and die, which is why I want to take care of myself now.

It’s been about two weeks since I started my new facials, and they’ve done wonders. I was even able to ditch my esthetician for my regular appointments because, like I said, I’m crafty, and was able to recreate her facials at home. 

One of my close friends outside of work, Gina, asked how I kept my skin so tight and beautiful. She’s reaching her late 30’s, so I just had to invite her over for a facial. Normally I’m one to gatekeep my self care routines, but this facial was too easy to recreate. I had no worries about running out of supplies for it. 

Gina and I had our favorite cocktails and we made our way to the kitchen. I keep my masks in the freezer. The cold is supposed to help depuff your face, plus it keeps the masks fresh for longer. 

When I opened the freezer, Gina gasped. I assumed at first it was because of how extensive the mask collection was, but then she passed out right on the kitchen floor. I’m not sure what happened, maybe shock? I couldn’t wake her up. I decided to just let her sleep, but that wouldn’t keep me from my masking time.

I decided on Kelly’s face for the evening, and grabbed my vial of blood from the side door. I spread her blood around the inside of the mask, making sure it filled each crevice. I couldn’t let any of my skin get away with not sucking up these important nutrients. Plus, Kelly’s always worked the best. 

Trying to make my way to the bathroom without dripping any fluid on the ground, I placed my face mask on, making sure to cover as much surface area as I could.

Kelly’s face wasn’t as plump or fresh as it was just a few weeks ago, but no matter what, she would be young forever. That’s kind of what I’m going for with these masks as well. As I’ve said before, skin care will always be important.

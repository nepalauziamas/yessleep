I thought I would start out this one with my thoughts about what I should do tonight before going in. u/AirF0rce_11 suggested that I ask Tom about the other night shifts, considering that at least one of them should know about these ghosts or spirits or whatever the hell they are. When I come back home, I’ll try to update this tonight… or I guess tomorrow morning, depending on how I feel.

If you have no idea what I’m blabbering on about, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/xhipo3/night_shift_at_a_data_center_it_fucking_sucks/) is my first night shift.

Well, *I* survived the shift. Here's what happened earlier today.

As Jonah requested, I called him just before entering the building.

“Hey, you asked me to call you?”

“Yeah, you enjoy your weekend?”

He attempted to start some small talk to adjust the mood, before I interrupted. “No offense, but I kind of want to get this whole ghost thing situated before I do anything.”

Silence came from his end, until he sighed and said, “Quite frankly, these things are new. At least, the two that you mentioned are new.”

“Please don’t tell me that there are more of them.”

Another distressed sigh, “I wish I could tell you otherwise, but generally, they were just kind of there. Almost like spectators, where they don’t really do anything but just kind of stare at you. What you saw last night must’ve been what Samuel saw.”

I would say I am embarrassed that I didn’t know that the guy who quit was named Samuel, but quite frankly, it’s his fault I’m in this situation. If you somehow read this, Samuel, fuck you.

I cleared my throat and said, “Any advice you can give me for tonight?”

“Yeah, don’t forget to label both ends of the cable for the customer.” He hung up before I was able to finish calling him a smart ass. Officially, he is still my supervisor, but at this point we are closer to friends than coworkers. So I can and will get away with calling him a smart ass, respectfully.

I went through the entrance to see Dave is in the office. Dave gave me a wave and started packing up. He doesn’t talk too much, but he’s a decent guy. Just as I was sitting down, Tom entered the building.

“Hey John, hey Dave,” Tom said with an enthusiastic smile. Tom isn’t as energetic as Matt, but he isn’t a quiet guy.

“Hey Tom, Jonah assigned us with the cable run for South Logistics. The 75-foot cable should cover the distance,” I said, while watching Dave sneak out the door to avoid small talk with Tom. Once Dave was out, I asked, “Tom, what do you know about the ghosts here?”

His once cheery appearance quickly faded, and mumbled, “Yeah, I heard that you also had a run in.”

I almost peaked up, excited that I wasn’t just going crazy, but calmed myself and replied, “It was not a fun experience, but I was hoping that maybe you’ve got advice or a way to neutralize them?”

“Let’s go run this cable, then we can talk about them. They tend to come out when it’s dark, so I’d rather not try to defend myself while trying to slide a copper cable through floor panels.”

The cable run went pretty smooth, it took us roughly two hours to run, confirm the ports, and test the cable. By the time we were back in the office drinking the cheap coffee the company provides, I realized that I forgot the fucking labels. I really need to make a sticky note or something, and I hate that Jonah even reminded me. I started getting up and told Tom that I need to label the cable, when he told me to not worry about it.

“Dude, it was literally the last thing Jonah told me to do. It’s a simple job, I’ll be back in five minutes.”

“It’s already 8, let me come with you at least to make sure nothing happens,” he said with his newfound serious tone.

Honestly, I don’t know why I was trying to play it tough at first. I shrugged that thought away and quickly accepted his escort. We decided to take the elevator to let us rest for a little bit, but that didn’t last long.

The elevator lights flickered, and the cables above started screeching.

Tom looked to the top of the elevator, annoyedly, and said “Really? You are doing this ag…” He was cut off when something hit the elevator, from the bottom. Whatever it was, there was really nothing we could do to stop it, so we just stood there for a second.

Until the lights completely turned off, and a heavy breathing was heard between the two of us. I shut my eyes and tried to hold my breath. I saw some sort of light shine through my eyelids, and I heard an electronic *ding*. The elevator doors opened up, and I opened my eyes hoping that whatever that was, left.

It did, but so did Tom.

I started freaking out, trying to figure out what to do, when I saw the security guard across the hallway walking back to the server room.

“Hey, have you seen Tom by chance?” I said, hoping that maybe he just sprinted out and did not say anything.

“Tom? Oh, yeah, the other guy who was with you. No, I haven’t seen him since the two of you did that cable run.”

“Thanks, and sorry to bother you, but did you see or hear anything… weird?” I tried to explain, but I sounded more like a confused idiot.

“Sorry bud, everything has been quiet up here. Maybe you should go get some coffee if you think you’re seeing things.” He walked away and went back to his small desk.

I took a second to catch my breath, and decided to try the staircase in the back. It could have been the big mouthed entity. I was hoping that was the case, since that one seemed less dangerous. I walked down the staircase and reached the main floor.

No entities, no Tom. I walked around the entire first floor, I couldn’t find Tom anywhere. While walking back to the office, I decided to give Jonah a call and try to figure out what to do.

I called him and told him what happened, he said to just be on the lookout for anything in the lobby. Apparently, this isn’t the first time someone was taken by the elevator entity.

I honestly need to come up with some nicknames for these things. I’ll take any suggestions for the elevator one, but I think I’m going to call the one near the back staircase “loud mouth”. For the other one, I will figure out a name for him eventually.

Anyway, after calming down, I decided to just hang out in the office until I noticed anything.

Another few hours passed, I’m only halfway through my shift, when I heard tapping.

I saw loud mouth on the other side of the glass window, separating the office from the lobby. He pointed to the utility closet in the corner of the lobby.

I turned around to grab my phone in case I needed a flashlight, but when I turned back, he was gone. Before leaving the office, I looked at the security cameras to ensure that there wasn't anything else in the lobby or nearby hallway.

After checking, I went ahead and carefully stepped out into the lobby. I creeped over to the closet, and counted to three before opening it.

There was a hastily written note on the floor of the closet. It read:

John,

If you are reading this, I am still alive. It may take a couple days for me to get out, but don’t worry, this isn’t the first and I doubt it will be the last time I enter the Shadows. I don’t have much time, but you must remember three things.

1. Do NOT speak to the one that looks almost like us, his disguise gets better each time he fools someone.
2. The one with the big mouth is not exactly evil, just be wary. Not everything is as it seems here.
3. There are always more of them.

Good luck,

Tom.

After reading that, I stuffed it in my pocket and headed back to the office. Whatever the fuck was going on, I am not leaving until my replacement comes.

The rest of my shift went smoothly, there were slight interferences on the security feed, near the customer cubicles, but I’m hoping it was just the weather. Once Matt came in, I started packing up and did not give him the pleasure of small talk.

My schedule is a bit off, but it allows everyone on shift to have enough hours, I usually work Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. I will attempt to update you guys on Thursday or Friday, depending on if I actually see any activity, if not, I will update you guys on Saturday.

Hopefully, I see Tom again, and maybe he can give me some answers. For now, I’m off to bed, and I’m glad I’m not dealing with all of these things on my own.

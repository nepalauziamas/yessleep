I remember I stayed like this for a good few days after, too. I basically went through almost the next week and a half or so completely blank. Mindless, emotionless, and just generally absent from life as a whole; both at home, as well as school or anywhere else. Danny's murder was on the front page of the paper the next day, as well as the morning news. At school, it was all anybody could talk about.

Whispers started going around that it was some random dude stalking the school Friday night who'd managed to snag Danny while no one was around. Of course, the more serious ones started speculating the killer was someone *from* the school. This led to a handful of witch hunting groups being formed that went around interrogating anybody that was unlucky enough to come into their crosshairs. By the end of the week, so many damn fights had broken out and kids being jumped; both of which resulted in numerous hospitalizations, that the school was forced to shut down for the next week.

Through this period of time, outside of one chance encounter with one the leaders of one of  these bands of idiots; Clarence Gorman (who, funny enough, happened to be Francine's boyfriend -- foreshadowing's a bitch, ain't it?), I'd managed to pretty much fly completely unnoticed. They didn't get rough with me, either. I guess, despite the fact that my crush on him was at the time kind of a well known thing, they figured I was either WAY below his league (in other words, not really worth his time talking to), or that I was just generally too timid to be considered a suspect for something like this. Like I said, though, none of that really seemed to matter to me in any real way.

Instead, I simply went through every day in a trance. What was worse, was that all of what'd happened was affecting me even more at nighttime. It got to a point where, due to not being able to sleep out of fear that I was gonna see someone *else* getting mauled, I was actually beginning to hallucinate. During the week-long shutdown of the school, Mom took me to see a counselor after noticing that I'd not slept for, by that time, five and a half days straight.

I wasn't much for it. Hell, what was some shrink gonna do; tell me I was going nuts? Maybe tell me that I was losing it because of the worry over Danny's death, and that *that* was causing me to "fantasize" that Sarah and Francine were dead, too? I figured, if nothing else, though, I might be able to get thrown on some pills or something and then whatever was causing me to see any of that stuff would stop, right?

Well, that's sadly not what happened. Yeah, I told them what'd been going on; the shit I'd been seeing, and yeah, I got put on some prescription pills; but no, they didn't do a damn thing. I found this out that Wednesday night when, as I was actually sitting down to eat supper, it started again. This time, it started differently; with whoever it was just following behind somebody else.

Like the other times, this was yet another abrupt shift from reality. Seriously, one minute, I'm looking at my bowl of lasagna, and the next, I'm going down a dimly lit street, looking at some random stranger's back. This time, the unsuspecting victim was someone I didn't recognize offhand. The kid was young, around my age. Other than that, though, I had no idea who this person was or why they were being selected to be killed (of course, it wasn't like I was given any kind of reason as to why the others had been killed, either).

This went on for about a minute or two, with the killer quietly skulking behind this kid, before the kid was then joined by three others in a cul-de-sac. Of the trio that was gathered around, one of them, I *did* recognize. It was Clarence.

They'd gathered at the cul-de-sac and Clarence was holding a basketball, about to start dribbling, when he then pointed behind the kid to the person who'd been following. I couldn't hear him, but I could see Clarence point out and move his mouth, probably asking something along the lines of *"Who the hell are YOU?!"* Whatever he said, it didn't matter because, in the span of less than two seconds, I could see the killer break into a sudden sprint, pouncing and going full throttle on Clarence, grabbing his throat and repeatedly driving the back of his head into the asphalt. The others tried to force the killer off, only to be shoved or even *thrown* away.

By the time they were finally satisfied, Clarence's face was hardly even recognizable as a person -- much less as Clarence Gorman. Just like with Francine, it didn't end there, with Clarence's death. I saw the killer's hand dab its index finger bin the blood that began pooling around his head before then drawing another symbol or something like what'd been done with Francine. This time, though, the vision lasted just long enough for me to see what it was they'd scrawled in the blood, causing my heart to stop cold. It was *MY initials!*

There was no mistaking it. It was written in the same pseudo-cursive style I used when signing my initials, having never *actually* mastered writing in cursive, but still wanting to look "fancy". Mom always teased me, calling it "redneck cursive". Not only that, but they even added the little heart I always drew next to my initials as well. Now I was horrified.

*"What the fuck?! Who is this?! How do they know my name, and how can they copy my handwriting PERFECTLY like this?! Why are they doing this to people; people I know?!"*

When I came back to reality this time, I began screaming, going into a full psychotic episode. It was so bad that I even began trying to tear my hair from my scalp. Mom actually had to pin me to the floor and restrain me until I eventually calmed down and just began bawling. She asked, frightened and almost at her wits end like I was, what'd happened. I tried as best I could to tell her what I'd experienced, but it was clear she wasn't exactly buying it. I don't think she thought I was just trying to get attention or anything like that, but I could tell she wasn't taking well with the "I watched another kid from school get killed" story, either.

I didn't know what to do. I wanted all of this to stop, but how was I supposed to do that? How, if I couldn't tell who it was that was doing this. Obviously, though, the *biggest* questions were still *"Why was I having to see this? HOW was I seeing it from their perspective."*

That next morning, we visited the psychiatrist, where he and my mother then spoke in private for the entire half hour before it was then apparently decided that the best thing for me was to spend some time in an in-patient program. They apparently thought that some time away from everything that was going on in town would help to get rid of the visions by "Cutting out the excess stress", to quote the shrink. I didn't bother fighting. I knew it wouldn't do fuck-all in that regard, but at least there, I couldn't hurt myself and/or continue dragging my mother down with this.

By the end of that week, I was moved into the facility. It was one of those that looked like a, albeit well kept and sanitized, group home or sort of halfway house. Along the walls in the hallways were all sorts of cheesy inspirational posters and some different papier Mache crafts peppered across going all the way down.

I spent the better part of a month there at first. During that time, things were quiet. No visions, no friends and classmates being murdered, and no freak outs. The staff and counselors there, though not understanding what I was talking about when I tried explaining to *them* what'd been going on, were still super nice and helpful with me. And with things being as quiet as they'd been for the time, I thought everything was finally over; that I really *was* just "Overly stressed" or whatever, and that I'd be able to go back home and everything would be okay.

Then, on that last week, just a few days before I was supposed to be released, I saw the newspaper headlines with the discoveries of both Sara and Francine's bodies. Both articles listed them as having been dead for weeks, close to two months when they were found.

That was when, about midday that same day, The police came to the institution to question me. Like before, they seemed keen on the idea *I* was the one doing it, even if they weren’t quite as direct in their accusations like the one was before. I could still tell. And could I really blame them? *It WAS my initials on the bodies — signed, sealed, and delivered...*

But, even still... it WASN’T me. I wasn’t doing anything to anybody...

*Was I?*

At any rate, I told them as much and eventually, they let me go. They of course told the supervisor at the institution to “keep a close eye on me” before leaving, which resulted in them restricting the time I was allowed to spend out of my room (not that I *really* left much anyways, but still; it WAS annoying as hell to have to be followed even MORE constantly than I already was by not one, but THREE supervisors just to use the frickin’ bathroom). I guess, aside from the initials and the fact that the victims were people I knew, they had no *actual* evidence to tie me as the culprit.

At the same time, that was little consolation; if any. Sure, I wasn’t walking out in handcuffs (yet), but that didn’t mean I was out of the woods. Not by a long shot. Whoever it was was still out there, and I had not even the remotest fuckin’ clue who it was and how/why it was using my name. And what’s worse, I STILL wasn’t any closer to knowing how I keep *seeing* these people being butchered. And I think that was my biggest source of insomnia fuel; the fact that some sick unknown freak was out there doing this shit to people I knew, people I cared about, using MY identity, and all I could do was sit and watch them do it.

Well, I couldn’t take it anymore. I couldn’t take not being able to sleep. I couldn’t take the looming fear that I might get imprisoned for murders I knew for a fact I didn’t commit. And most of all, I couldn’t take not knowing if or when (or why for that matter) I was gonna see *another* innocent person get killed. I was done with *everything!*

I planned to do it at supper time that night. Using the cutlery they gave us (even if it *was* all plastic), I’d put the fork and knife through both my eyes, hopefully reaching the brain and it would all be over. It would end that night, there and then, one way or another. I sat down with my meal tray and took a quick glance around. No one was watching. I knew I’d have to be quick, though, as that wasn’t gonna stay the case for long. I clutched the cutlery and brought it up to my face. *”Just one quick thru—”*

“Susan?” I snapped up, startled. It was mom. She’d come with a bag of food from Burger King. “Hey honey,” she said in a sad tone, like she was visiting me in the hospital on my deathbed (apparently irony’s a bitch, too). “I brought you a Whopper combo, your favorite. I thought I’d join you for supper tonight.”

I looked at her, tears starting to sting in my eyes. I wanted to be happy. Hell, she was right; she DID bring my favorite (B.K. had been my go-to anytime I was asked where I wanted to go for dinner). Not only that, but she was there. I guess it’s just natural, even when you’re all but grown like I was. *I still needed my mama.*

But at the same time, I wanted it all to be over. I *needed* it to all be over. But I couldn’t now, not with her there.

Eventually the dam broke and I just devolved into a sobbing mess at the table. “Shh, oh honey...” Mom cooed softly, her own voice starting to break, “It’s gonna be okay. It’s gonna be okay, mama’s here. We’ll get though this.”

I just cried pitifully in her arms. I wanted to scream, I wanted to shout; Hell, I had more than half a mind to get up on the table, strip, and start shouting to the world that no, things *weren’t* “gonna be okay”. That someone was forcing me to watch people get murdered, and that there wasn’t a goddamn thing I could do about it. But I knew; what good was *that* gonna do me?

They hadn’t believed it so far, and now I was “quietly” being investigated by the police. What was the point then in trying to “get through this”? *”One way or another, I’m just gonna end up behind SOME set of bars...”*

Mom and I sat there for the remaining 45 minutes in mostly silence. She tried to engage with me, sure; asking me if I was getting along okay enough here and if the staff was nice and if I’d made any friends. She *tried*... but I couldn’t have cared less. I just nibbled at my burger like a mouse, coldly staring about a thousand miles past the wall behind her.

The time rolled around to leave the mess hall and go back to our rooms for the night. One of the supervisors came to escort me back to my room and mom left. Walking back to my room, I remember trying to plot another way of trying to end it when it happened. This time, I was immediately thrown into hysterics.

For one thing, unlike all the other times where I couldn’t tell *where* it was taking place, *this* was all too clear to me. It was happening right there, IN THE INSTITUTION! It was in the mess hall, focusing on my mother, who was headed towards the door into the main hallway. *”Oh dear fucking God, no! MOM!”*

I remember I was shrieking and howling as this happened. I felt rough hands grabbing my arms, trying to hold me still and lead me to my room. “NO!” I remember screaming, “LET ME GO! LET ME GO, YOU FUCKING PIGS! GODDAMN IT, YOU HAVE TO LET ME GO!”

I continued to watch as they moved in quickly on my mother, ambushing her. She spun around just in time for me to see the look of shock and panic wash across her face before her face was cracked against the door behind her. I then watched her unconscious body be dragged across the floor towards the kitchen area.

Inside, I saw two of the cooks attempt to rush the killer, only to be thrown aside, with one even having a bread knife get embedded in his shoulder for his trouble. The attention then returned to my mother’s body as she was then dragged further toward the back until stopping in front of one of the deep fryers. Mom was slowly stirring awake as the killer began lifting her off the ground.

In my frenzy, I managed to send my head back, cracking my supervisor straight in his nose, busting it wide open. This caused him to let go of me and I took off like a bat straight out of Hell to the mess hall. Because I was still seeing through the killer’s eyes, it was damn near impossible for me to make back down the hallway without slamming into the wall like I was a bumper car. Fortunately, I still knew how to make it back down to the mess hall from where I was as my room was just a few rooms down from the one I slept in.

I finally flew through the doors into the mess hall and sprinted into the kitchen right as Mom’s horrified face was plunged into the scalding hot grease. “Let her go!” I screamed.

I saw the killer’s view peek around the corner to see me, standing at the opening of the kitchen. That was when my own sight returned. With this, though, I felt my head start pounding, like I’d just been cracked over the head with a hammer.

Around the corner, I watched a figure; the killer, also clutch their forehead like they were in pain, too. I looked closer and my jaw fell. *”What the fu— No, no that’s not possible, that isn’t...”*

But it was. It was *ME*. I was looking at myself. *I was looking THROUGH myself!*

“Who are—“

“You.” It said, sounding exactly like me. “You, Susie; I’m you.” I began touching my face. This thing — “Other Me” — had paper white skin and no eyes, instead having two red “X” shapes over the skin where her eyes SHOULD’VE been.

“What are you talking about?” I asked, now just as much confused — actually, just as *lost* — as I was panicked. She just tilted her head to the side, pointing to her left temple.

“I’m you. I’ve always been you. I’m the little birdie in your head that’s screamed to be let out. I’m the one that’s always pushing you to do what needs to be done.”

“What do you mean? Do what? To who?” She then pulled my mother’s body from the grease. She wasn’t moving. “Other Me” threw her to the ground in front of me. Her face was now peeling away all over like it was paper, revealing layers of meaty sinew underneath. My stomach turned over, bile rising up to my throat.

“That’s what should happen to all of them. They don’t believe you, they never will. They don’t believe what we’re capable of; what YOU’RE capable of. They just look at you and say ‘she can’t do anything about it.’ They scoff and say that you’re too innocent.”

She looked down at mom’s body and grinned, revealing teeth that were exactly like mine, including the braces I had back then. “Well, how’s THIS for ‘too innocent’, huh?” I retched and looked her in the eyes.

“You’re a *freak*!” I shouted.

“*I’m* a freak?” She retorted sarcastically. “I’m just you, Susan. I’m just a part of you. A part of you that you’ve kept buried, thinking you could keep me like that forever so you could keep being a soft little bitch. Everyone has one, it’s a part of everyone from the time they were born; there’s always been a ‘me’ inside of them.”

“You killed my friends! For what; because you could?!” Her grin fell.

“‘Friends?’ You really don’t know, do you? You *actually* thought those cunts were your friends? You thought they cared about you?”

“What do you—“

“Think about every time you’ve tried hanging around them. Think about every time you turned your back on any one of them and listened because they thought you couldn’t hear them.” I paused at this, my breathing slowed.

*(“Look at her.” They say, laughing...)*

*(“You SURE we have to invite her?”)*

*(“We should find a new table; away from her, you know?”)*

I began concentrating. I didn’t want to, but something was gnawing at me now. A sort of knee-jerk reaction, almost, spurred on by what “Other Me” was suggesting. Because of this, things I honestly didn’t think I’d noticed before started being made clear to me. 

I started thinking about the looks I'd get in the hallway at school. The "Look at 'Ms. good girl'" look. The look that said they barely tolerated me. I started hearing the whispers, coming from seemingly nowhere, yet at the same time, I knew it came from them, my peers; my "Friends". I could hear them talking about how they'd wish 'That girl' would go away. How they were *just fine* until 'that girl' showed up and made everything boring. It was always a subconscious thing for me before, thinking I was being paranoid, you know? They weren't talking about *me...* right?

*Right?*

*"They were... They're talking about me. I'M 'that girl'..."*

"Getting the picture now?" Her voice brought me crashing back. "They weren't your friends. They *tolerated* you so they wouldn't have to be the 'bad guys'. They put up with you being around them so they could keep lying to you, the rest of the world, and even themselves the same way you're trying to do now by saying that you're a 'better person'. Let me be the first to be honest to you, the way I have been all your fucking life while you've tried to ignore me; NO one is truly a 'better person'!

"NO one *truly* gives a damn whether you're alive or dead. They *MIGHT* shed a few tears; *actual tears*, over you when something happens, sure, whatever. But it won't last. And those are just 'the better ones' you keep wanting to run your mouth about. The majority," she waved her hand around the room, "Will just keep walking; not remembering or having a single care in the world that you're not around."

I was speechless. My body was a statue, with my mouth dropped wide open. I had no way to retort. 

"I mean, Hell," she went on, "remind me of what you were gonna do before Mommy dearest here came in?"

I looked down at her, tears burning in my eyes once more. "I... I was... I was..." A lump formed in my throat. "I was gonna end it."

"Uh huh, and why was that? Why were you so ready to go if people *actually* cared like you say they do, huh?" I kept looking at Mom. "Crickets... I hear nothing but crickets, and you wanna know--"

"You're wrong." I said, interrupting her. "You're wrong. She *was* there. She wanted to be there, she was trying to make me happy. She just wanted to cheer me up because of what YOU'VE been doing."

Her face fell further. Her appearance of control was gone. "But what about--"

"What about them?" I spat. I could feel determination welling up inside me. "So they were fake. So they only put up with me to make themselves look better, so what? That's *them*." I looked once more to my mother. "She always had my back, even if no one else did; and you just murdered her. YOU. I'm not like you, not at all. I don't care if you *are* from my subconscious or whatever, I stand with what I said; I'm nothing like you!"

For a moment, she just stood there, noticeably trembling. Her neck twitched more and more violently. My own body tensed up. I was ready for her to, at any second, leap at me to attack. Suddenly, however, she stopped, relaxing her body, and just smiled before vanishing into thin air. I started to look around for her before then dropping down to feebly try to check my mother for some kind, *any* kind, of life. Nothing. No breath, no pulse; nothing. She was gone.

I burrowed my face into her chest and I just began sobbing. I'd failed. Mom, my own personal cheerleader, my one *true* friend, was gone. She'd saved my life, only to have to pay with hers. No, worse; She saved my life, just for hers to be taken by... by... *by me!*

Even if it *wasn't actually me*, it was till *my face* she would see before being forced into the oil. Not only that, but whether I liked it or not, deep down -- *FAR* deep below even the darkest parts of my mind and my heart -- I knew; "Other Me" was right. She has, and always had been, a part of me; something I'd kept buried so long that, eventually, it forced it's way up and out, even finding a way of taking a mind and form of it's own. It's own face, one that showed how ugly both it and I was at the same time.

Soon, I was being hoisted off of my mother by staff and police who'd been called by one of the cooks who'd managed to limp away and call 911. That night, I was arrested for the murders of both my mother and the cook who got the bread knife lodged on him. The trial went on for almost a month and a half. During this time, they even tried bringing the previous murders into question; only for them to be deemed ultimately inadmissible in my trial, due to lack of evidence that I was the culprit. To this day, their cases still *officially* remain unsolved.

Regardless, I still got what, I guess you could say, was coming to me. Thanks to the attorney my mother always had for me and her in case of any legal matters (notably when I was younger with the custody battles with my father), I was able to plead insanity and have my sentence reduced from 30 years in prison, to 25 in a mental institution. That said, it wasn't any sort of cake walk from there. The new facility was nothing like the one I was at before. 

Instead of the brighter, more welcoming environment I was in before, everything now looked a lot more dull and lifeless. The staff were also a lot less friendly and inviting than what I was used to before. They weren't outright mean or abusive or anything, but they always just looked blankly at me, like they barely noticed I was even there. *Almost like they didn't care...*

It's been almost six years now since this all happened, and I've been here, in this place, ever since. Because I'm considered "Too dangerous to myself and others", I'm not allowed outside except to be escorted by two armed security guards to the cafeteria and to the restroom. I'm also not allowed cutlery, nor am I allowed pencil and paper. However, after good behavior and the shrink's orders, I was allowed to type this out here. They feel that reaching out might make it easier to reintegrate back into the world or something without having to actually be near somebody. 

I doubt that. I honestly doubt I'll ever be able to be out there again like I was. See, I'm scared now. It was because of an ingrained feeling that "Other Me" was even able to exist in the first place. Just like she'd said, she was a part of me, and everyone has one just like her; a part that they try to keep buried and forget about. A part that you may not even realize is there, until it eventually crawls its way up and forces itself out of you, taking on a form and identity you've never seen before, and yet, at the same time, is only a reflection of you.

I'm afraid... because of what I may find lurking inside me. I'm afraid of looking through its eyes again and seeing what I truly am on the inside...

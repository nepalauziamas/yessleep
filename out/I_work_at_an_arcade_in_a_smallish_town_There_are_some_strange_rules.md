 This all happened before COVID-19 hit the world. I think it was in 2016, perhaps? I started working at the arcade some years before it all happened. I've had run-ins with the manager and all that. When I got hired, however, the manager made us all, as the new employees of the arcade, memorize some specific rules. These were unusual considering we were working at an arcade with things like Pac-Man and Frogger and Donkey Kong, you get the idea.

Here are the rules of working at the arcade. Note that all of the events have happened at the same arcade.

**Rule #1:** *If a new arcade game shows up either by the name of No Heart, No Soul or with .exe on the end of the title, do not play it, or let any patron play, at all costs.*

This was the one rule that I almost broke. When I had to memorize the rules, my first thought was, "that's the most ridiculous set of rules I've ever seen!" After what has been going on, how could I not think they were serious?

Originally, Rule #1 just had "with .exe on the end of the title," but the part about No Heart, No Soul was added after the deaths of a 10-year-old nonbinary kid named Gabriel Meyers and a 14-year-old young woman named Natalie Schmalz happened as a result of playing the game. According to the account of the manager, a former employee named Tomas Ferrier allowed the game to be played, the kids played the game, it displayed a creepy message, and it added a creepy-ass character with the player's name, which was uncanny, since arcade games shouldn't even have the player's name already if it wasn't entered.

And the avatars the kids had both talked to a character that looked like a mix of a female pirate and a biker punk. They then had to complete strange, difficult challenges. They couldn't complete them, resulting in the screen showing a message saying, "GAME OVER! May the next victim play?"

Both Gabriel and Natalie went pale and catatonic after that. As if the game had stolen their souls. Another former employee named Markie Harrison recounted that the game had shown up in another arcade under a different name.

Now I'm going to tell you about when I almost broke the rule. No, this did not involve No Heart, No Soul. The arcade had just opened up for business, with Gallaga, Ms. Pac-Man, a vehicle arcade of Batman, a dance machine, you name it. I was cleaning up before work when I noticed a new arcade game just got plugged in.

Its title was Donkey Kong.exe.

I at first shrugged it off, thinking it was a bootleg Donkey Kong arcade. But the rules! I snapped out of it and reviewed the rules.

I read and reread Rule #1. Thinking it was ridiculous, I went and let the arcade open, ready for the patrons to play.

But the kids immediately noticed the new Donkey Kong, and they all gathered around it out of sheer interest. Almost as if they just became zealots for a deity of sorts.

"Mr. Crabb?" one of the kids asked me, "Can I play this?"

They were pointing to Donkey Kong.exe. I was about to let her play it when the manager showed up out of nowhere. He came to me so fast I swear he came up out of the ground.

"Rule #1, Danforth!"

"B-But I can't disappoint these kids..."

"As if I'd allow the monster to do its thing! Whatever you do, do NOT let the arcade under any circumstances be played by anyone, including yourself! It has not succeeded in finding another victim in six months and I will not let it happen again!"

Later, after the arcade closed, the game was unplugged, hauled off, and gone. No child played the game that day.

**Rule #2:** *If no person comes out of the Laser Tag arena for 30 minutes after they enter, notify the manager immediately.*

After my run-in with the manager after nearly letting the girl play the game, how could I not want to follow the rules?

This happened about a month after I saw Donkey Kong.exe.

As a general rule, we have to observe the time of the next group of people playing Laser Tag goes in. We also have employees keeping watch on the Laser Tag in case of Rule #2. Normally, a period of Laser Tag lasts 20 minutes, so we're usually good on that.

I had the shift that day. I watched the people go in, so I wrote down the time they went in. I know, I know, we get bored on these kinds of things, but how can we not be bored when we just have to watch the entrance to the Laser Tag arena?

The time was 2:37 pm when that group went in.

I watched the entrance, glancing at my watch to make sure the Laser Tag game lasted 20 minutes and no longer. My coworker Myles ghosted up to me, as she always has.

"Danforth, how are you doing?"

"Myles, don't you dare sneak up on me like that! I need to make sure that Laser Tag goes smoothly!"

"Oh? That's what you have to do today? Okay..."

She went back to her janitorial duties. By then, I glanced at my watch.

3:05.

I dashed straight to the manager's office, after having noticed that nobody came out of the Laser Tag arena. After my run-in with Rule #1, how could I not?

I burst the door open, and I said in a volume that was almost like shouting,

"*Rule #2! Time was 2:37 pm! 12 people inside!*"

With this, the manager got up from his chair so fast I thought he was about to run for his life.

"Shit! Shit shit shit *shit*!! Move aside! I knew this was going to happen again! I knew it I knew it I knew it!"

He grabbed a screwdriver and a wrench from his desk drawer and rushed straight to the Laser Tag arena. He opened the circuit breaker inside and did some things that would require the skills of a mechanic. After about five minutes, I saw the twelve people I saw enter the Laser Tag exit. No harm was done.

Later that day, I had asked the manager about what happened that prompted him to make this rule.

It turns out that some residents of the small town had gone missing after sometimes going into the Laser Tag. He showed me the MISSING posters, and even showed me some paperwork with notes by previous employees, about the times they went in, and how they found the 30-minute mark passed, and then noticing the batch of participants didn't come out.

I had realized that what he did was a type of procedure that stopped the monster within the Laser Tag game. He discovered it in some sort of manual.

I realized from his reaction to my notifying him of Rule #2, that the rules weren't there out of silliness. They were there to protect us all.

**Rule #3:** *If a blonde woman in a red dress asks for a prize, under no circumstances should you give any of them to her.*

This happened to me for the first time about a whole month and 5 weeks into the job, no more and no less. I was given the shift of the prize counter that day. Note to you guys, we change jobs weekly, to make sure everyone does what we need to do to protect us all.

I was working the prize counter. There were interesting things, like the toy balls and the NERF guns you could find, but there were also plush animals.

Luckily, the woman in the red dress can take "no" for an answer, making her one of the least dangerous things on the job at this arcade.

I got about seven tickets from this kid and they asked for that unicorn, and I gave them one. But in the line... was a blonde woman in a red dress.

Right behind the kid who wanted the unicorn.

She looked like her hair was really bleached white. Her dress was like a red-colored version of Morticia's black dress in that TV show. Her figure just looked awfully attractive... and creepy.

She came up to me and asked,

"May I have one of the plastic pirate swords?"

Then she offered 5 tickets. Exactly the price of the fake weapon. I would have offered it to her, but the thing I found off about the tickets was that... there were no numbers on them like they normally do.

I said no. She just smiled and walked out of the arcade.

I went to the manager to find out more about this rule.

"Hey, can I talk to you for a second?"

"Danforth, are you going to tell me you broke a rule?"

"No, just to find out more about Rule #3."

And with that, he gave me a stack of papers. When the arcade closed for the night, I read through them, the headlines jumping off the pages.

**FAMILY MURDERED IN HOME.** Article from 1985. That article's words read something about one of the guys working at the local arcade and offering a prize to a woman in a red dress the day before the family was murdered.

**ENGAGED COUPLE KILLED.** Article from 1987. The wife was working at an arcade when she offered a prize to a woman in a red dress right before the night they were killed. I could see some handwriting, but it was hard to read. It read, "It's the same lady."

Several more articles read about someone having offered a prize to a blonde woman in a red dress right before the deaths of them and their families. When I got to the last page, there was handwriting.

"I better make a rule for this to avoid any more deaths."

**Rule #4:** *If there is a power outage in the after hours, hold still. If an arcade turns on by itself during said outage, go straight to it, and play the game until the power comes back. Make sure that when you play the game under that circumstance, to make no mistakes whatsoever.*

Normally, we are not supposed to play on the job, but if the circumstances for this rule happen, that is where we have an exception. As we switch jobs weekly, I sometimes have janitorial duties in the after hours. Two weeks into the job, I have janitorial duties in the after hours, and the power goes out. Including the obligatory lights that stay on when all the lights are off.

I stood completely still, thinking the power outage would be temporary. But an arcade came on. Turned on by itself, with a start-up screen, and the number of credits needed to play already in.

This was a standard game of the one with that hamster wheel children love so much. Where you have to roll the thing through the course without falling. I walked right up to it, gliding ghostlike right to the childish game.

And when I played, it was as if the difficulty was set to expert mode. It was hard not to let the wheel fall off. I kept on playing, just to keep it from falling.

The hamster wheel was at its first goal in 4 hours when the power came back on. Relieved, I went to the manager to tell him what happened.

"I saw you playing on the job. Rule #4, Rule #9, or were you slacking off?"

"Rule #4, boss."

"Good. If that should happen again, then do that playing."

No harm was done that night.

"And remember, Danforth, if Rule #4 should happen, making any mistake will do to you what that monster did to Gabriel and Natalie."

As I remember from reading a retired employee's account, as we are required to do to avoid making mistakes, he recounted that the two kids appeared to go catatonic and their skin went paler after they each got a game over on the mysterious arcade Rule #1 was made for.

**Rule #5:** *If all the arcade screens show the exact same image, notify the manager immediately.*

I have janitorial duties, but sometimes I work the prize counter and sometimes I also watch over the Laser Tag to make sure that it works properly and I don't have to do Rule #2. I had been working for 3 months then when all the arcade games suddenly blinked on in the after hours when the games were supposed to be turned off.

They all showed the exact same image. The image was that of a mix of a biker chick and a Disney princess of some form.

I remember getting the last of the mess I had to clean up from the mini-restaurant fast and running straight to the manager.

"Rule #5!"

"Okay, Danforth. Stay here. I'll take care of this."

Then the manager rushed straight to the arcade game with the biggest screen, which was in a corner of the arcade. He stood straight-faced in front of the screen, and asked whatever that girl was on the screen,

"Alright, what do you want this time?!"

The girl in the image on all the screens spoke to him, as if there were multiple girls speaking at once.

"You know what I want."

"Cut the bullshit, lady! Tell me what it is you want!"

"You made rules against it, remember? You know the games are hungry..."

"Not after Gabriel and Natalie!"

"Rules were meant to be broken. You know what I want, Lester..."

"Like I'll ever believe that bullshit saying!"

It seemed as if the arcades were possessed by some strange monster. I felt as if we were dealing with some sort of demon. I remember watching this all helplessly like I had no way to deal with this.

"You think you could make a rule against the creature I am, when I need more..."

"More what?!"

"You know what I want..."

"No fucking way am I going to let another child die!"

"Don't you remember? I want someone to play *No Heart, No Soul*..."

"Hell no!"

"Please. Why don't you let this CUTE little man play it, too...?"

"Not a chance! You will pay for this! Rule #1 is there for a reason!"

There was silence for a few moments. Then she said,

"You have given me what I want. All I really wanted was for you to remember the fear you had when I took those souls..."

After a moment, I heard the manager say,

"You bitch!"

And then the arcade screens turned off. No other incident happened that day. I remember being vividly scared.

A few nights ago, I was dreaming about some sh*t in school, but then suddenly, everything went black. I was then in a warehouse that was empty save for a rocking chair that I was sitting on. I tried to move, but couldn’t. Then, the chair slowly started to rock and that’s when I heard the voice. A terrifying, otherworldly voice that sounded like it belonged to a demon.

“I see you Jake,” it said. “I see your hopes and your fears. Your brother will be mine.” I tried to scream, to shout, but I couldn’t so anything. The next thing I knew my mom was waking me up for school. ‘It was only a dream,’ I thought.

But then, while in class, something terrible happened. Someone came and took me to the front office, saying my parents had something urgent. I was confused and scared. What on earth had happened?

When I got there, my parents looked up, tears in their eyes. “Jake, your brother disappeared last night.” My dad said, in barely more than a whisper. What? I was spiralling. My dream had come true. 

“What do you mean he disappeared?” I asked tentatively.

“When his roommate woke up, he found Mike gone. There was no trace of him. It was like he had vanished.” Tears welled up in my eyes. That thing had taken my brother last night. I was now terrified for when night would come. I was taken home with my parents, and I immediately went up to my room and tried to pass the time.

Before I knew it, night fell. I tried to stay awake the whole night but due to sheer fatigue, I fell asleep at around half 2 in the morning. 

My dream this time was normal. I was Goku. Kicking butt and being awesome. When, once again, everything went black. And I was back in the warehouse. But there was a difference. One that chilled me to the bone. My brother’s body, right in front of me, at my feet. His body seemed fine. As I stared at his body, the voice came.

“Hello Jake.” Unlike last time, I had a bit of control over my body.

I managed to say, “What are you.” It chuckled.

“Who I am is not important. Who is next is the real question.” 

“And who is next?” I asked, dreading the answer. Instead of an answer, all I could hear was something breathing in and out. 

“Who is next?” I asked a bit louder. More feeling came into my body and as it did, I started shaking from fear. It still didn’t answer. And that’s when I heard a scream. A scream that sounded like 

My dad.

I awoke. It was light, around 6am. Without hesitation, I ran to my parent’s bedroom but no one was there. I checked every room and when I finally got to the kitchen, I found my mother crying. She turned and looked at me.

“Your dad is… gone. Just like your brother.” I fell to my knees, sobbing. My dad was 

Gone.

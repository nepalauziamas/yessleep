We were just chilling in front of the television, idly watching the colorful images without thinking too much about its actual content. That had always been our usual routine, to get home, not speak, and just turn our brains off for the evening. 


But on that night in particular, all of our phones went off within fifteen seconds of each other. We all jumped to attention in confusion, checking our phones simultaneously. All it had been, was a simple message, but one carrying a crystal clear meaning.


Emergency Alert: This is a message to the citizens of Newport. Do not leave your homes, stay inside and don’t open the door to anyone, not even your own family or friends. This is not a test, stay inside. Turn off the lights. 


Our minds raced, but none of us were able to speak a single word. I looked over at my Dad, who’d put on his glasses to make sure he read the message correctly. My mother seemed worried, her eyes filled to the brim with panic. 


“What is this?” my Dad finally asked. 


While the message was clear, it didn’t really explain the situation. It was the first and only emergency alert we’d ever received in our small town, apart from the occasional test message. It was real, something dangerous was on its way, and we hadn’t the faintest idea what. 


I went over to the window, only to see each and every one of our neighbors begin to turn the lights off. Within a couple of minutes, the entire neighborhood had turned dark, leaving us confused in a haze of ignorance. 


“I’m calling the police,” Dad said as he dialled the number. 


It started to ring, and Dad put the phone on speaker. But, instead of a person picking up, he just received an automated message. 


“We’re experiencing heavy call volumes at this time. Please, do not hang up, you will be redirected to one of our dispatchers shortly.” 


“What is going on?” Mom asked. 


“I don’t know… this is…” Dad said before trailing off. 


I still stood by the window, watching the empty neighborhood, wondering if anyone would defy the message and go outside. In the meantime, Dad was trying to call the police again. After the third attempt, he tried to reach his coworker instead, who lived further downtown. 


“Hey, David, did you get the same message as us?” Dad asked. 


“Yeah, it’s bizarre. Most people are staying inside though. A few went out on the street to mess around, fucking idiots. They seem fine, but I don’t know - wait, what’s that?” 


Dad waited patiently as David went silent on the other end of the line. 


“I think the military is out on the street, but they look odd. They’re all wearing gas masks, but the masks have three eyes… I don’t even know what kind of weapons they’re carrying.”


“Can you take a picture and send it to us?”


“I’ll try, hold on.”


A few seconds passed, and another beep could be heard from my Dad’s phone, signifying that we’d received a picture. My Dad quickly opened it, but what greeted us was little more than a tangled mess of colors from a clearly corrupt photograph.


“David, the picture isn’t showing up. Try again.”


“Yeah… it doesn’t work, the camera won’t save the pictures correctly - “


A loud, screech took over the line, shoving us all to the ground as we held our hands tightly over our ears. Though it came from the phone, it was an impossible sound that should have blown the speakers to smithereens in a second. 


Once the sound had subsided, we could still hear someone frantically breathing on the other end.  


“David, what happened?”


“They - they kil - killed them all. They shot them with these weapons, just shredded them to pieces. All tha - that’s is - is - '' he stuttered. 


“David, you need to hide!” Dad yelled. 


“But - they’re - they’re just standing there, it’s like they’re frozen in place. I don’t understand, why are they doing this, why are they - “ his words froze in his throat. “Oh, my God. They saw me, they’re coming towards me, they’re - “


Then the line fell dead. Dad tried to call David back up, but no one responded. Our house fell dead silent, only interrupted by the intermittent beeps produced by the calling phone. My mom wandered nervously around the house, and I just stared at the window, paranoid that something might break through the door. 


“He’s gone… For fuck’s sake, David, pick up the damn phone…” Dad mumbled to himself. 


That’s when I saw them, walking down the street. They weren’t moving normally, and their steps were too quick, each movement snapping into place. They were wearing strange uniforms that might have looked like military uniforms in the dark, but once they got closer, it was clear they weren’t even human. 


One of the neighbor’s doors shut open, and the Johnson’s came running towards the military, thinking they were finally safe. But, no sooner had they been spotted by the marching creatures, before they lifted their weapons. The same screech filled the neighborhood, almost knocking me to the ground as the air literally started to vibrate. The family screamed in agony for a moment, but within seconds, their bodies just started disintegrating, until all that was left was a pile of flesh that resembled minced meat. 


I wanted to scream, but before I got the chance, my Dad put his hand over my mouth. 


“Do you wanna die? Keep your mouth shut,” he whispered. 


Just that mere sound, briefly turned the creatures attention in our direction, but once we fell silent, they just stopped. There they stood, as if frozen in time. For minutes, all we could do was stare at them in shock. Then, one of the neighbor’s automatic lights turned on, triggered by the cat returning home. The same second, the creatures all turned to the house, raising their weapons and firing. 


As the loud sound rang through the house. My Dad grabbed me and my Mom. We were taking the opportunity to flee to the basement, where we prayed we might be safe at least for a while. We never even saw what happened to the neighbor’s house, we just heard the screams of agony as they all fell to pieces. 


Now we’re just hiding down here, without food, without water. We’ve tried to call for help, but no one is picking up. Either everyone else is dead, or the rest of the world has been left in the dark about what’s currently happening in our city. I don’t understand why no one has come to help us, maybe they just think we’re already dead. So I’m sending this, a hopeless call for help. If anyone out there receives this, please save us...

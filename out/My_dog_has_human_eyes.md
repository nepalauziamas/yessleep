Usually, my dog has normal brown/hazelish dog eyes. But after I came home from my week long business trip, something about his eyes changed. I couldn't exactly pinpoint the change in his eyes but something felt odd. His eyes looked like they didn't fit, he was acting out, he wasn't playing around like normal. He had something wrong. I drove to a vet with my dog, who I will call Pawprints because that is his name I guess. Now, Pawprints was a cute cuddly guy, he loved the cats that we had and we used to sleep together on my bed. But he stopped and thats why I brought him to the vet.




I had arrived to the vet with my dog when people started staring at me and my dog. Than this person came up to me saying "Your dog has weird eyes"
"Thanks. It's not like I brought him to the vet FOR THAT REASON" I replied not shouting until the end.
Before I made a fool of myself my dogs name was called in "My dog has been acting weird, not playing and cuddling with me like he used to, his eyes look weird too, like humanoid and they don't fit in his head."
"Oh, I haven't heard of a dog acting like that but sir I promise we will make your dog act happy again!"
Oh yeah sure they promised...
I got my dog back 3 hours later and the veterinarian said "We can't find whats wrong with your dog, are you sure he doesn't act normal?"
"Yes! I know my dog and he isn't acting like he USED TO HOW HARD IS THAT TO UNDERSTAND?!!"
I was shouting. But I just wanted my dog back and that THING was NOT MY DOG? She couldn't get that THROUGH HER 1 DEGREE HEAD?!
Alas, there was no fix for my dog so I brought him home after going out on that vet like there wasn't a problem in the world, rested him in my couch as I ran upstairs to my bedroom. After 15 minutes of overthinking I finally fell asleep.




It's 2:57 AM when I heard it.
An earpiercing shriek that sounds like someones getting heart surgery with no anesthesia
It was downstairs. I ran to my closet to grab my shotgun and ran downstairs screaming "WHO'S THERE?"
I saw in the corner a long skinny white looking creature that had the same eyes my dog had.
Without a second to think, I loaded shotgun and fired at the creature and the creature seemed to be annoyed.
I reloaded my shotgun, ran to the creature and fired at him closer.
He didn't move. I was so confused that I tripped, fell, and accidentally turned on my light. He freaked and I ran towards the backdoor and opened it to let it out
It ran out into what I am assuming is the woods.
I was freaking out and so confused. I closed my door and slowly walked back up to my bedroom.
I fell asleep at 4:50 AM with my job starting at 6:00 AM.
Needless to say. I was tired when I went to work.
I don't know what the creature and I don't really want to know.



Yesterday, my friend came to me saying "Dude my dog looks like he has human eyes, what do I do?"

I live in a town that’s in the crosshairs of being rural and urban, however, I live in a very rural part of this town. 

I was coming home from my friends house that was around 15 minutes away from my place. It’s a pretty decent drive and includes taking the highway and going down several secluded streets. Anyway, I get off the highway and continue about my drive as usual when I noticed in my rear view a car was tailgating me. I sped up a little hoping that he would get off my tail but he sped right up towards me. I just thought to myself that he’s another annoying Florida driver and continued my now rather fast speed.

We pass several neighborhoods, and at this point in the drive I usually am alone because I do this almost every night, but he didn’t pass into any of the 9 neighborhoods on that street. We turn down a very isolated street that has one more neighborhood off the side of it. He doesn’t turn into there. At this point I’m starting to freak out a little, because my neighborhood is full of old people who go to bed at 10pm at most, it’s 2am at this point. We then make the last turn before approaching my neighborhood, and the setup of this road is 4 houses and then a 4 way stop. If you go straight past the 4 way stop, it leads to my neighborhood, the right leads to the back entrance of the last neighborhood we passed, and the left there are absolutely no houses, just a very dim road leading to a major road. This was my last test; we passed by the 4 houses and I turned left, down the road where no one lives. At this point, if he turns down where I am, he is definitely following me, because no one goes down that road after the path we just took; they would’ve gotten off on another exit in the highway. I make the turn and look in my rearview. 

He turned down my street. 

At this point I’m freaking out, I have my friend on the phone and I gun it down this road and essentially lead him on a wild goose chase down abandoned roads that were nowhere near my house. At this point, he knows that I know, and he tries speeding up to me on these long patches of road. The nearest police station is miles away, this is going to be a problem that I have to solve. 

After him chasing me around for several minutes, I turn onto the other major road parallel to the one that we were on where he started following me. I blended in with 3 other cars that were out that late at night and by the time I made that turn he was down the street from me so I thought I lost him for sure. After driving for 5 minutes with no one on my tail, I go home. I get out of my car and stand on my driveway talking to my friend that I called and thanked her for everything and telling her how crazy that was when all of the sudden, I see a car with the same paint job, size, and headlight position as the car that was following me turn into my neighborhood.  I screamed and ran inside my house. 

I locked the door, set the alarm, and went in my room. I live with 4 big dogs that are very protective, so I felt like I had layers of security inside my house if that was the same person. For all I know it could be someone different just getting home late like me, but that would just be a crazy coincidence. It’s a day later and nothing has happened, so I think everything’s fine, but still, was pretty scary in the moment.

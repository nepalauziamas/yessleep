I finally did some journalism, and I didn't die!

Last night, I came home and posted the update. I was entirely caught off guard when a mixture of smoke and steam began emanating from down the hall.

Unfortunately, I did not own a weapon at the time. I stealthily made my way, finding the source of the smoke and steam. My bathroom door was open a crack, and the shower was running.

I slammed the door open, void of patience after how powerless I felt between the witch and the girl. "Breaking in is one thing, but the damn shower?!" I shouted, feeling a vein bulge across my temple.

Like whispers on the wind, a voice deeper than any layer of hell replied with "show a guest some hospitality." Every fiber of my existence began screaming to run, to escape the primal, predatory aura the thing exuded.

Before I had the chance to act on my fight or flight response, the purple mask emerged from the shower curtain. Its thin lipped smile glistened from the moisture, its marble eyes gleaming with demonic glee.

A series of expletives squeaked from between my lips as I shrank back.

The devil masked man continued from the shower, the shower water replaced with the growing crackling sounds of… of the fire.

It's not real it's not real it's not- I repeated in my head, though fell blank when the impossibly solid hand grasped my face.

"I'll be taking this" the devil spoke with malicious glee, reaching its fingers towards my eye, forcing the lid open as I tried squeezing them shut. A third hand erupted from its chest, plucking my eye with surgical precision.

In no way do I recommend testing it for yourself, but I truly felt nothing. For whatever reason, the devil chose to be merciful as it tore my right eye out.

A fourth hand morphed out from the wall, patting me on the head. "Good boy. The fire isn't real." With those words, my stomach lurched. "My apologies for this," the devil began tossing my eye from a fifth and sixth hand, back and forth. "I needed a sample for your assignment tomorrow, and eyes work the best."

All I could do was sputter weakly, nodding my head faintly in acknowledgement. 

The devil retracted all of its arms, gave a single nod, then retreated to the shower. I crawled down the hall, too weak to hoist myself up and into bed. I ended up sleeping on my hardwood floor that night.

I laid on the floor, not bothering to change out of my boxers, nor brush my teeth. I felt far too nauseous to move.

8:56am rolled around, which I knew from the alarm I had set up. Strangely, I remained where I was. I cautiously fluttered my one eye, rubbing it to make sure I wasn't hallucinating.

About a minute passed, relishing in the freedom from that hell hole… then I blinked.

"A bit late, are we?" An unfamiliar voice sounded disappointed. "And open your eyes, man. C'mon" the voice scolded.

I parted my left lid… then my right. I had two eyes again. Which I used to look down, finding myself in an alien outfit. I sighed harder than I ever had before, despising being the butt of someone else's joke.

"Oh, take this" the short woman said, tossing a cylindrical glass object to me.

I fumbled with it, managing just barely to catch it. I wish I hadn't.

A murky, brownish, yellowish gelatin filled the glass jar. I leaned in closer, trying to identify the ball inside.

My fucking eye. In my hands was my God damned eye. Fuck this!

I inhaled deeply, trying all I could to keep calm. I don't mean to pat myself on the back, but I managed to keep my cool. "What's my job today? And where are we?"

"Impressive!" The woman snickered, though her expression read as somber. "Welcome to the FaeForcast headquarters. We're the reporters to you journalists."

I gestured for her to continue, earning a glare. I gave a small, shit eating grin in response.

"You're a real jackass," she rolled her eyes. "We have a corpse. Where there's a corpse, there's a story."

"Ha! I'm actually a Journalist today?" I pumped my empty fist in the air, excited for a return to normalcy.

"Well, you're on your own. Have fun, ass hole" She gave her own shit eating grin.

I followed maps through series of a desiccated blocks, swerving to avoid odd shaped potholes and debris. It looked like the Tasmanian Devil tore through the area, then a mammoth ran through.

The hospital came into view, though it was only discernible thanks to the faded hospital directory standing outside the skeletal structure.

A bed lay propped against the sign, the entire ground splattered in blood. Bricks and other parts of what once was a hospital stood in an unruly pile. Atop the pile, three figures frantically dug through the wreckage.

From the relative safety of my car, I called up to the trio, "hey? Were you guys expecting a journalist?"

Without stopping, one of the three shot up a webbed hand, one thumb up. I took that as confirmation.

I carefully approached, notepad in hand. "I was informed of a corpse-uh hi?" The creature between the two men finally registered.

It had a tail covered in rainbow scales, tentacle-like hair, and over sixteen tongues lashing out and feeling between the rubble.

"Get up ere and help already. We're all too old for this, youngster!" One of the men shouted down, waving me to come closer.

I climbed up the destruction, slipping as loose debris broke off. I reasoned that, worse case scenario, I die. But I dare not defy the rules, even if a witness posed them.

If I had to guess, the two men were in their forties, but they couldn't be human. The one left of the mermaid monster was gray, like a zombie. The one to the right couldn't be much healthier either, missing a leg and sporting greenish skin.

The one with only a single leg had a sort of translucent, ghostly leg instead of a proper one. I was unsure, and still am unsure, if the leg was a projection. He could lean on it, but rubble would phase through it occasionally. 

"Stop staring and lend a hand. There should be a giant pocket ah goop somewhere in here." The one legged man instructed, hastening his digging.

I got to work, digging alongside the depressing rainbow musketeers, until my hand sank into lukewarm custard. My stomach shot upwards as I fought the urge to vomit. Through clenched teeth, I forced out "I think I found it."

With lightning speed, the wannabe mermaid dashed beside me, frantically uncovering more of the custard like substance. The neon green muck almost seemed to grab for the mermaid, desperate for any contact. The two men eagerly joined the effort, wearing both glum and glee on their faces.

The gray man produced a palm sized rectangular object, then plunged it into the ooze. The moment the metal box disappeared into the sludge, a booming eruption blasted the debris clear. The four of us were hurled from the peak, but we never landed.

Instead of crashing into the mess below, mucus like appendages caught us… by engorging us in its slime. A booming, childishly energetic voice cried "Cyr!!! Ren!!!" Then after a pause, "other detective guy? Wizard pimp?"

"Tal!" The one legged man cried, a massive, warm smile now across his face. The mermaid thing glowed brightly, even through the green sludge. I mean that literally, the creature's lower have shone brilliantly shades of aquamarine and green. 

When the amorphous blob finally decided to lower us to the ground and free us, it shaped itself as though from a 3D printer. Layer by layer, a twenty foot tall humanoid took shape.

I inched my way to my car, expecting this to be where some rule was brutally enforced, but was haulted by an all too familiar sensation.

A both rough and slimy tendril flicked my calf, though not coiling around. It was more of a warning, than anything.

With a gulp, I spoke up. "I believe you are my interviewees?" My voice trembled, the tendril lightly flicking me again and again.

To my credit, I managed to disagree with them at every question. Even as they grew more and more righteously frustrated.

"Are you some sort of journalist?" The gray man asked.

"No sir." I winced, not proud of the blatant lie.

"Are you some sort of defective experiment?" The one legged man pressed, reaching for what I imagined to be a concealed firearm.

"No no, nothing like that!" I waved my hands out, then raised them in surrender. They had me dead to rights, but I was not willing to violate the rules.

"Why you here?" The tall, overgrown child belched, stretching as though just waking from a nap.

That question was tricky. I considered my options. On the one hand, I could tell the truth. But would that warrant agreeing with a witness? Biting my lower lip, I squeezed out "I was sent to hear the story of a dead body. I don't see any body, so there must be a miscommunication." I reasoned, holding my breath as I waited for some hellish punishment.

"Well, we don't see any corpses. If you don't get your ass out of here, there might be one soon, though." The one legged man threatened, drawing a very odd looking pistol from his belt and taking aim.

I reversed out of there in a flash, not willing to take a bullet from asking questions. I've been crushed in half and smashed to death, I did not intend on adding 'shot dead' to that list.

Before walking into the FaeForcast lobby, I scrawled some brief notes from the experience. I prayed that would suffice for coverage of the encounter.

This post is getting long and I'm pretty exhausted, I'll finish this story in another post, later. Till next time, I'll try not to break any rules.

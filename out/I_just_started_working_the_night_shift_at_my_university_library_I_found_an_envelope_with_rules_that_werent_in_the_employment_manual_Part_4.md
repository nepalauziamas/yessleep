The library was eerily quiet. The silence felt deafening, I felt as if the world was closing in around me. My wheezing breaths, a product of me trying to calm down, filled the staircase with noise. But I didn't feel alone. It's a horrifying sensation to feel as vulnerable as I did then. These monstrosities were coming and going with impunity, I couldn't stop them or control them and I was left to navigate these horrifying interactions with only a stupid fucking piece of paper as my guide. I'm not ashamed to admit that I was a baby-backed bitch for a few minutes. I sat with my back to the wall on the staircase and tried to think. 

&#x200B;

*Okay, that was horrifying* I thought, getting the obvious out of the way. *But it still went exactly as the letter predicted. The tall man hadn't rushed me or tried to harm me, even though he certainly seemed capable of inflicting damage. I abided by the instructions and I emerged totally unscathed.* At every turn the letter had proved both valid and valuable. The information I received was clearly comprehensive and ostensibly accurate. The guy that I took over for had done the job for months and he was still alive. I could get through one night. I checked my watch. 3:21 AM. 

&#x200B;

I walked down the staircase and returned to the security desk. I quickly reviewed the letter. 

*Rule #1:* ***Never*** *look at the hallway safety mirrors in the basement corridor. Keep your eyes low and walk swiftly.*

*Rule #2: You will encounter an unfathomably tall man in a gray suit. Do not look at his face. Answer any question he asks you with "no sir" and he will go away.*

*Rule #3: Stay out of the atrium from 2:15-2:16 every night. It's better if you don't see it.*

*Rule #4: You will hear some horrible fucking sounds from study room 219J on occasion. Don't ever open the door.*

Rule #5: Always walk **beside** the book shelves in the west portion of the fourth floor, never between them.

*Rule #6: If you hear tapping coming from the glass window behind you at the security desk, DO NOT turn around.*

*Rule #7: At 12:15 you'll see a heavy man in a tweed suit hurry past you clutching his briefcase. When you see him walk past you, tell him "today is not the day, friend." He'll look relieved, nod and walk out of the library. If he gets up the stairs, you're already too late.*

I had already dealt with our tweed clad pal, encountered knock off slenderman, and I had made sure I was in another location in the library other than the atrium from 2:15-2:16 so that wasn't a concern. That left rule 1, 4, 5, and 6 as threats still in play. Rule 1 seemed pretty easy, I already followed it successfully and stayed safe. Rule 4 seems straightforward enough, just have to steer clear of the 2nd floor study rooms. Rule 5 would only be a concern when I entered the fourth floor, which only happened once a night for the security sweep, and I didn't need to enter the book shelf aisles for any reason. Rule 6--

My thoughts were interrupted by a faint ticking sound from behind me. I was initially puzzled. The only thing behind me was the glass window embossed with our university sigil. I thought it must've been a twig or something being blown into the window as it was extremely windy that night. I was turning around to investigate when I stopped just in time and recalled the contents of rule #6, the very rule that I was interrupted while reading. *Rule #6: If you hear tapping coming from the glass window behind you at the security desk, DO NOT turn around.* I realized that what I thought was a twig was much more deliberate and sharp sounding than a stray twig. It had increased in both frequency and volume to the point where it had to be performed by a person. It wasn't a twig I'd heard, it was the click of a fingernail on glass. Someone had to be standing inches behind me, right up against the window pane. The tapping, which had started out as slow and deliberate had sped up and was clearly more forceful than it had been a moment ago. The tapping was almost frantic, it became difficult to distinguish one tap from another. 

&#x200B;

"Fuck this," I said. I promptly stood up, walked around the side of the desk and basically sprinted to the stairs, leaving whatever fucked up entity was tapping on the window in my dust. I laughed to myself when I was safely on the second floor. I always wondered why the protagonist in horror movies didn't just walk away instead of lingering in the demon-possessed area, and here I'd gone and done it. Not so hard. I sat up in the second floor commons and flipped through tinder on my phone. I checked my watch. 3:53 AM. *Well, shit*. I thought, relief beginning to wash over me. *I survived the most wack library on planet earth.* Before leaving I had to put my black, university issued work polo in the employee garment cabinet downstairs. It was a bit of a walk and I thought about just taking the polo with me, but I didn't want to end my first shift by breaking the library protocol. I sighed and strolled down the stairs, stealing a glance at the window behind the desk as I did. Totally normal. 

&#x200B;

I was practically beaming with catharsis when I entered into the network of hallways, feet away from tossing my polo back in the cabinet and booking it home. When I came upon the first turn my eyes naturally flitted up the wall and my blood turned to ice. I had been so caught up in the promise of leaving the library that I had forgotten rule #1. I froze, feet from the corner with my eyes transfixed on the hallway mirror. I couldn't believe my eyes. 

&#x200B;

Staring back into the mirror, feet away from me on the other side of the wall was a man. His skin was jet black, his clothes were in tatters, held together by a few threads. He was barefoot, and a massive human, at least 6'6" and riddled with muscles. His eyes were wild, they shone a chilling yellow in the reflection, locked with my stare. But the most noticeable thing about him was has face. His cheeks had been sliced from the corners of his mouth nearly to his ears, causing his face to droop forward, wet blood bubbling around his white teeth. A moment passed where we held each others' gaze, his breathing unbelievably loud, shuddering his whole ribcage as he inhaled and exhaled rapidly. Then the lights in the hallway went out. I saw his yellow eyes widen and a piercing shriek filled the hallway. I heard footsteps thundering around the corner. Breaking out of my fear induced paralysis I jolted and began sprinting away from the corner, back towards the atrium. I heard the man closing in on me, that shriek coming from just a foot or two behind me, ripping into my ears. Just as he was nearly on me, the screaming stopped. The footsteps stopped. The lights flicked on and I whirled around to find myself alone in the hallway. There was no sign of the man anywhere, but the door on the right side of the hallway was flung wide open. I was shocked, as this is the first time I'd ever heard of that area being unlocked. The door read 

&#x200B;

**STATE HISTORICAL SOCIETY. AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY.**

Quickly I ran to the door, slammed it shut and ran out the door of the library, throwing my work polo on the desk as I ran by and hastily locking the door behind me. I had finished my first shift.

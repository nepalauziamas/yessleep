Me and my new friend previously lost our jobs at the same time. We worked the same shift and became good friends along the way. We soon got fired for not focusing on the job since we were just mostly gossiping. 

Turns out, we both love horror. We absolutely adored the idea of "The previous owner left a list of rules to follow". He really wanted this to happen to him. So, we became roommates.

We were both just scrolling through a real estate website to which we found all of the houses amazing.
We had the best choices but we had other variety's.

Just kept scrolling.

Until we found something.

My friend (we will call him Z) calls this house "The house of a thousand horrors".

I agreed with him.

It very much suited it's new name since it litterally looked like Luigi's mansion but in a tinier version.
I'm really not joking, it even has the lanky chimney on top. So we would soon find ourselves holding the endless keychain of keys which were mostly spares for the front door. But one key caught my attention.

It had a red cover and a little case for the end of it, I thought, "Who the fuck uses this type of bullshit of a key?" I questioned.

I took the covers off and it said "DO NOT USE FOR ATTIC".

...

Why the fuck would you make a key you don't want me to use? I told Z, he beamed at it. He started get all excited and told me, "What if this is some sort of secret entrance to a parallel universe? What if this is a demon hiding in the attic? What if-"

"Stop." I said. I couldn't stand another chill up my spine as I thought of the demon clawing its way through my body.

"Let's just go in and move all of the furniture in." I said bluntly.

And so we did.

There were endless boxes of furniture in the corridor.

But a piece of paper caught my attention.

It was a list of rules.

I was sure I was being pranked by Z.

But I thought of the key.

And that encouraged me to read it.

Rule 1: DO NOT under any circumstances open the windows during a hot day. The consequences are much worse than a sticky T-Shirt. 

Rule 2: Open the upstairs bathroom window at 12:00pm and close it as soon as it hits 12:02pm. This will let "it" know that you are in the house.

Rule 3: DO NOT open the 3rd cupboard of the kitchen, otherwise the "thing" in there will jump straight through you with its claws out.

Rule 4: SERIOUSLY DO NOT OPEN THE ATTIC. I assume you die within seconds since no one ever lived to tell the  tail.

Following these rules will result you in a happy life under the roof of this building.

I was speechless.

I needed to call Z.

"YO DUDE." I yelled

"GET DOWN HERE." I yelled again.

"Coming!" He answered.

As soon as I showed him the note he was instantly amazed. He dreamed of this moment, he would be in a paranormal house for years following rules.

"Is this bullshit yours?" I asked angrily.

" No what the fuck?" He answered.

Soon I realised there was a harsh wind hitting my waist.
The window was open.

I rushed for the handle. But when I arrived I saw what looked like a skinwalker, sliding it's ass along toward me.

I froze.

I closed the window but the creature stood there staring through the window.

Me and Z are now standing in the upstairs bedroom. With the window open. I closed it as soon as it hit 12:02pm.

I don't know what to do and I recently heard the downstairs window smash open. I think the creature is in the house. Eventually expecting to find it's prey, which I assume is us.

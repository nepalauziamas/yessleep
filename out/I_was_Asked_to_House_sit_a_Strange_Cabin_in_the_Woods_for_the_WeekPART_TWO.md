My “friend” was keeping something from me. I noticed dark streaks of dirt smeared across his backside and decided to ask him a leading question to investigate. The right answer was obvious, yet he said something that completely contradicted reality. He told me that he was working at his parent's farm, which would be a pretty normal thing around these parts, except for the fact that both he and his family are from Oregon, which is nearly 2000 miles northwest of Kentucky, where we are now. Even stranger is that his parents still live out there. Unless he was able to somehow travel 30 hours in less than half a day,  there's absolutely no way that could be possible. In other words, he couldn’t have been telling the truth even if his parents did own a farm, which they don't. Why did he have dirt smeared across his back, and why was he lying to me about it?

“Hey, I’m gonna go make a call, okay?” I asked him in a way that definitely could have made me look suspicious, even to a normal person. He didn’t respond, rather, he just tilted his head toward me and nodded as if to give his approval. I evaded his company and walked off to the bathroom where I could have some privacy. Despite the poor aesthetic of my apartment complex, the walls were impressively soundproof. I pulled up my phone and scrolled through the contacts. I clicked on my mother's name and immediately the phone began to vibrate. The moment the call began to go through I felt a pressure lift from my gut, like anxiety slowly melting away. I put the phone to my ear and heard a static begin to play through, indicating that she had picked up. 

“Hello? Mother? There's something going on. I think I’m going fucking insane or something, I-” I was cut off by knocking at the bathroom door. 

“What's going on in there?” Drew asked me in a way that sounded both offended and angry, but it was like he was trying to hide it. 

“I’m making that call, man. It’s my mother. Wait a minute, please.” I responded with nervousness filtering through my mouth. It wasn’t like him to be so intrusive, so…impatient. 

“Hurry up!” He said this in almost a commanding voice as if he was giving me an order. That just wasn't like him at all. Suddenly, I felt my temper begin to rise. I was tired of whatever it was that was going on, so I raised my voice at him.

“Drew, I swear to God. Go away!” I replied with a similar tone, which must have thrown him off his guard because he walked away from the door. I could hear his footsteps like combat boots against hardwood. I remember thinking What the hell? You shouldn’t be able to hear footsteps here. The floor in my apartment was completely carpet, no wood, no stone, nothing. About five seconds later, his footsteps stopped. All sound in the apartment disappeared, and all I was left with was the static of my phone call. I knew something was wrong when I realized that this whole time my mother hadn’t said a single word. That empty static just continued to play out. 

“Are you there? Mom?” No response.

“Hello, where are you?” I asked with a wavering resolve. The static became distorted for a moment. It was like her phone was being moved around or something. The distortion started to slow down, and the static turned into a voice.
“You’re…missing…the…game” A deep voice echoed through, crackling and muffled. I dropped my phone and jumped back.

“What the fuck!” I started to hyperventilate and fell to the floor, scooting up against the tub. I stared at my phone screen in horror at what just occurred. I was waiting for something else to occur but the drop seemed to power off my phone. I must have sat there for an hour or two because when I came out, the sky was two tones darker. There was nobody in my apartment, and the TV was off. It was almost as if nobody had ever been there in the first place. I walked back to the bathroom to pick up my phone, and check it for cracks. It was pretty much fine and I decided to place it in my pocket. I decided that something was wrong with my apartment, and I needed to leave. I opened the door and ran downstairs to the manager's office. I pounded on the door and waited for a response. Eventually, the door opened and the manager walked out.

“What's going on? Is everything alright?” He sounded worried like he already knew that something was amiss. I told him that somebody was intruding in my home and that I was scared. I didn’t know how to explain to him what it truly was that had happened. However, as we trekked the stairs back up, I decided to make an attempt.

‘It was- It impersonated my friend. It looked like him, but it wasn’t him.” I blurted out, realizing soon after how insane my explanation sounded.

“What? What do you mean? You need to tell me exactly what's going on.” He responded in a way that allowed me to rephrase my statement. I began to open my mouth, but before I could get so much of a word out, the apartment buildings carbon monoxide alarm started to go off. It sounded like a loud incessant beeping. The blaring must have struck a nerve in me because my heart started to pound rapidly. Similar to what had happened earlier in the bathroom, I began to hyperventilate.

“Whoa there, calm down! Slow your breathing for me, you’re alright now.” He said to me in an almost paternal manner. My vision started to fade in and out, and each time it did I found him standing in different positions around the complex, just staring at me blankly. I couldn’t keep my eyes open long enough to react through the cycle, but eventually, I just passed out. I had never experienced a brownout before, but honestly, I don’t think anybody had ever experienced one like that.

Everything was just darkness for a while, but when I awoke I was blinded by the lights of police cars and deafened by approaching sirens. I was still completely dazed, and I could barely move my body. Everything was blurry and the light conquered most of my vision. I heard some people outside fumbling around with the doorknob for a few seconds before it opened, and two officers made their way over to me with desperation in their body movements. I moved my head away from the light and faced them. 

“There was a carbon monoxide leak in the building but everything is under control, you’re safe now.” The officer placed his hand on my shoulder and began to lightly shake me. I was awake but could barely enunciate a single word. The second officer began to snap his fingers in front of my face, and I followed them with my eyes.

“I-I'm okay. Fuck, what happened?” I managed to get a sentence out, and as I spoke, the cops began to calm down. This soothed the atmosphere and I began to calm down with them. 

“Your apartment manager here pretty much saved your life, kid, without him, you probably wouldn’t have made it. He said you were acting psychotic before you dropped dead on the floor. Whatever you saw, it wasn’t real, okay? That damn leak must have been slowly building up since the better half of the afternoon.” His words seemed to explain away everything that had happened. It was like music to my ears. None of it was real, and I was fine. 

“Anyway, we still haven't been able to trace the source, so you’re gonna have to stay somewhere else for the night. Do you have anywhere else to go?” When he asked me this question I immediately remembered the cabin. Now I would have to go, regardless of whether or not I changed my mind. 

I asked the officer what the time was, and he said it was about 3:07 AM. That seemed like the perfect timing, I was scheduled to be at the house by 6 AM, and I could probably drive there with an hour to spare If I left right now, though, there was no way I’d be capable of operating a vehicle for at least another 20-30 minutes. There was still panic looming over my head, and the effects of the gas were clouding my judgment. 

“Do you need a ride somewhere? I can’t recommend driving in your condition, but there's really nothing I can do to stop you, though, I can help you get somewhere else for the night if you need.” The officer who had previously been silent said to me in a voice that read I’m only doing this out of pity, or at least that's how I had interpreted it. 

“Unless you wanna drive two hours out of town, I’m not sure that there’s much you could do for me. I have to be at a job in a couple hours and I can’t miss it.” I told the cop in an unnecessarily harsh tone. I felt angry at the world for all the unexplainable shit that had been happening tonight. All of these crazy events were going on at once and I was just completely overwhelmed by everything. The most unfortunate part about it was that I believed everything would be better the sooner I got to that stupid fucking cabin in the woods, I guess that was the point. 

“I- I think I’m good to drive now. My head is feeling…more clear.” I mumbled out to the cop as I passed him by. I made my way to the car and sat down inside, then started to scream at the top of my lungs while banging my hands against the steering wheel repeatedly. I didn’t expect that to happen when I got in, but it just came out. I guess I felt better letting out all my rage in the not-so-private residency of my own car. I expected to see everyone outside shift their heads towards me in concern, but it was as if nobody could hear me. The sirens seemed to drown out the noise in conjunction with the walls of my vehicle. That was for the better, I thought to myself. I sat there for a moment, contemplating the events that had just transpired, and thinking about what really happened. Was I still sane after all? Was everything just some wicked hallucination caused by natural gas poisoning? All signs pointed towards the latter, but the more paranoid side of me was unable to fully accept that as an answer. The questions were driving me crazy, so I just shut down for a while. 

Before I took off, I decided to look back towards the gathering of officers and all the others who had been affected by the gas leak. Strangely, one of the neighbors stared back at me, and his face showed a level of abject horror. I felt as if he was piercing through me with his eyes, like he could see past some sort of veil. But maybe it wasn’t that at all. It could be possible that he wasn’t even looking at me, but rather, someone else in the car with me. This thought evoked a strong sense of fear that caused me to check the backseat every minute or so for the next half-hour of the drive. I would feel a presence in the car with me for a few seconds, before it would just disappear. It could have been my mind playing tricks on me, but I didn’t care. I had to look, each and every time, I needed to. However, no matter how many glances I gave, no matter how fast I turned my head, there was never anything back there. I was all alone.

After the anxiety stopped, the car ride became a slow and miserable slog. It began to rain heavily outside, and the pitter patter of droplets overtook everything else. I tried to focus on each individual drop, and decipher some sort of pattern in the falling, but of course, there wasn’t one. I was bored and had nobody to talk to. Yeah, I was used to being alone, but this time it felt deeper than ever before. The feeling permeated in a way that could be easily mistaken for dread. This was the result of my anxiety culminating and being released all at once. After what just happened, I can’t blame myself for feeling some sort of way, I just expected it to be expressed differently. I never would have thought an event like this could trigger loneliness, and I didn’t look forward to feeling this way for the rest of the drive. I just wanted to get there as soon as possible. The rain was both overwhelming and relaxing at the same time, and helped to distract me from my own base emotions. However, it was a little too distracting, because I was starting to feel drowsy, as I wasn’t able to get any real sleep all night. I didn’t wanna pass out on the wheel, so I reached into my glove compartment and pulled out some old caffeine tablets I had been keeping for just this kind of situation. I popped one of them and threw the bottle on the floor. I expected it to perk me right up but nothing happened. I guess that was kinda an unrealistic expectation. 

Even though I had just taken those pills, I continued to feel tired. I tried my hardest to stay awake while waiting for the effects to kick in but it was taking too long. I was unsure whether I would pass out or not, so I pulled over to the side of the road and decided to spend an hour resting. I set a timer on my phone, and closed my eyes. The rain continued to pour over the top of my car, with streams of water passing by the surface of the windows, slowly making their way into the interior. I felt water droplets hitting my face, cooling me down and keeping me awake. I checked to see if my windows were rolled up all the way, and to my dismay, they were. Realizing that there wasn’t really anything I could do about the rain, I decided to climb into the back seat, though, I don’t remember much after that. It was almost as if I had fallen asleep the moment I laid down. The weird thing is that when I woke up, I was back in the front seat, still driving. I couldn’t believe what I was witnessing. I never experienced such a strange parasomnia before. The moment I fully became aware of what was going on, I slammed the brakes and smashed my head into the wheel. In my state of sleepwalking I must have neglected to put on a seatbelt, and now I was paying the price. I wasn’t severely injured or anything, but I got a terrible headache. I felt dizzy for a moment before noticing my surroundings. I had made it into the forest. 

I checked my phone and saw that my alarm was set to go off in a couple minutes, and I wasn’t really in the mood to hear it with my headache and all. After canceling the alarm I started driving, this time much more slowly than I had been previously. Using road signs, I could tell that the house was relatively close to where I was now, and I just wanted to get there as fast as I possibly could, so I could relax and forget about all the terrible shit that had just gone down. Believe me when I tell you, the way I’ve described these events up until now haven’t really done justice to the amount of sheer panic and confusion I was going through, but to be honest, I felt like I was on the verge of a heart attack. I eventually found a clearing in the treeline along the road, and turned into it. I could tell that this was where I needed to be, because there was another sign at the entrance that displayed the house number. As I made my way to the old couples house, I saw them in the driveway, and they were packing luggage into their car. The house looked nothing like the images I saw or the description in the email. The pictures must have been old, because that place looked like it was beginning to fall apart…

The splitter is a dream visiter lets begin.

I start in a densely populated area a type of city. I am not sure why I am there but I suppose its a vacation. Looking around for touristy things to do and everything seems normal. The occasional glance of a passersby seems like nothing. Getting closer to the tea garden I suddenly feel as though there are eyes burrowing into me. I stop and turn to look across the street and there is a bald child sitting on a bench staring at me. Its eyes pulse slowly as they change colors. Think someone with a dimmer switch on a light that takes a minute to get to full brightness and fade in the same time. I stare back for a moment and blink myself but it never blinks. Just goes from dead face stare to a sly smirk but constantly staring.

I shurg it off and try to keep on my day but as I  walk on that thing is staring at me. I thought it was odd and I know I am dreaming but decide against waking myself up. So i continue down the street knowing that the child is across the street. The feeling fades temporarily. I enter the tea gardens and round the the corner and its there. It looks slightly different slightly elongated limbs and had grown a bit of jet black hair. The face has turned int a Cheshire cat grin. Still says nothing. I find myself wondering how this thing got ahead of me but turned down a side path. Still decide against waking myself up but the thing lets out a giggle. This giggle wasn't normal think of a ringing maniacal laughter thats almost chilling.

The next time I see it is its in a bridge in the garden and someone passes it and walks my way. There appears to be a cut on its forhead in the middle bleeding yet its staring at me grinning. Seems to be blood on its fingers. The person that walked by it came close so I asked them about it.


"Whats with that child?" Pointing in the direction of the bridge. They gave me a puzzled look and look back then look at me.

"What child?" They reply. I find this strange only I can see it, now its wagging its slightly elongated finger at me shaking its head. At this point I have had enough and try to wake myself up. It laughs at me and leaps from the bridge and lands near me. As it stands to full height about 6 feet tall i notoced its face splt right downnthe middle. Now it has two faces slightly disfigured. Each face is moving independently in diffrent directions. Yet the two pairs of eyes are still transfixed on me. Both mouths speak in unison.

"Now now you know better than that." It laughs again. "You can only go when I  let you go. Be a good plaything and behave." It smiles "Unless, of course,  you enjoy pain." I back away from it an run as it taunts me laughing. As I run I remember this thing from my childhood. It toys with me and forces me to play its game where it hunts me. I lesve the park and look around, the city in me has decayed while I  was in there. The city seems less populated. Those I do see are sickly, coughing, boils on their faces, wailing. Behind me i hear scratching.

I turn and see it on the wall its limbs have become pale and more elongated. From the shoulder to elbow o would assume is about 2 feet. Its hands turned into bloody claws and face have split more. Due to the disfigurement not evey face has two eyes nor a working mouth. Each face is almost separately pulling away, as if trying to free itself. Yet every eye pulsating in unison is transfixed on me . The mouth has become filled with sharp teeth. I am mortified by this thing and run. 

As I run away shoving people or what was peole aside i can hear it running after me. All the while the city rots people turn to dust. I ended up tripping and falling I roll over to.see thing thing looming over me. Its face has become a mass of eyes staring at me with a long jagged mouth. Has hands with each claw being about a foot long. Its arms are scrawny, almost malnourished, pale and long. I would assume around four to five feet in length from shoulder its wrist. Its legs are the same as it crouches over me laughing at me. Its body is also skinny and elongated. 

It begins to reach down with its claws and I  try to scamper away. Its no use even as it toys with me and sliwly moves its former hands towards me it walks so its constantly abvoe me. I have no where to go. I feel it begin to grip me eaily surounding me with its now massive hands. As it lifts me up i feel agony as its claws sink into my torso and limbs. All the while it says in a twisted yet in unison voice.

"You know better." Tightening its grip around me i scream in pain. " you are pathetic, now die." Raises me above its head and opens its mouth slowly lowering me in. All the while squeezing me tighter and tighter. Surrounded by its teeth and gastly breath it laughs at me. "Just kidding" as it laughs at me.

I finally woke up hearing its laugh fading. Although i have no claw marks where it sunk them in still burns with agony. Its all phantom but lasts the rest odnthe day as I hobble around. I remembered having that thing hunt me as a child. I developed the ability to know ibam dreaming and wake up whenever i want. Except when that thing is in it. Somehow itmhas the ability to block me. So if you dream and see this thing. Good luck and hopefully you can break free before it catches you. Phantom pain isnt fun.

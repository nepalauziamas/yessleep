I was going home after studying late night at my school library. It was nearly 3:55 and i needed to rush home. I then saw a woman..a woman whose legs were twisted in the opposite directions. She kept muttering something that sounded like "I'll find you, I'll try" over and over again. I froze still in fear, whatever that was, it was not a woman. She stopped and turned, then i saw her face..in that dim light, i saw the thing that still haunts my dreams. teeth stained yellow that jutted out from her mouth like carrot and covered in blood, eyes jet black and dripping blood and tears. She ran towards me hastily and in a voice that almost sounded like weeping, now tears being added to the mix of that blood. As she gripped on my clothes, i could see her pupils just a little bit, they were like if someone mixed paint and then stirred it. Like cracks in the portal to hell, fiery red. That thing then asked me in that raspy, sad voice




"Have you seen my son?" I could not speak,i was in so much shock, looking at this thing that was impersonating a woman. I somehow blurted out "t-there" and pointed at a random direction. I just wanted her to go away. That was when she unnaturally contorted her hands and legs and she climbed up on the dark alley walls and scurried away. In the darkness, she vanished. I ran as fast as I can, but i could not run faster than that thing. I heard a scream, that sounded like a mix between a tigers growl and a snakes hiss. She shouted "HE IS NOT THERE!" and i saw her.. scurrying toward me with ungodly speed. I ended up fainting. My neighbour passing by picked me up and dropped me off. When i woke up, i faintly heard my parents.They were sobbing and saying that i may not wake up. When they saw me awake, they were extremely happy that i was still with them, but then i told them the description of that demonic entity and they stopped dead in their tracks. They then told me to wash up and get ready for breakfast. "Breakfast?" I asked confused. They were shocked to know that I didn't know that it was night or day! My parents then told me of Agnes. A woman who, 10 years before i was even born, enrolled her son, Jake to our school's hostel, her father was an alcoholic so she did this to save her son from that man.


Everything was going well until principal theodore's daughter, Bethany showed up. She was unnecessarily rude, and always got off Scot free of any vile act that she did. She used to bully that guy, poor soul.she would call him names, mess with his food etc. But one day, she crossed the line, when she recorded him showering and then decided to extort him for money. He used to give her all he earnt. But Bethany, unpleasant as she was, had no mercy and at Jake's award ceremony, showed the video to everyone. He ran up the stairs crying and decided that death is better than this humiliation and agony that he felt. So be jumped off the roof and committed the unthinkable. His mother could not handle the grief of losing the son she loved so dearly and to save him. She took a kitchen knife, cursed Bethany and then took her life. Bethany died of stage 4 blood cancer the very next year. So, she still roams the school and the areas around it, asking people for the direction of her son, my parents then told Me that principal Theodore was arrested for murder, it turned out he planned all this because he was better at studies than her and also that he helped Bethany bury the body behind the school where no one would find it. I was horrified. The next day, i took some flowers and found a mound of mud that i found very strange when i was in kindergarten and now i understood what it was.. it was Jake and next to it, another mound, his mother, Agnes.


 I put flowers over them and asked them to find peace. From that day on, no more incidents have occured. I hope that they are happy wherever they are.

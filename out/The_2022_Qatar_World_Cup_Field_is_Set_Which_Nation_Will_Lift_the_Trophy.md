Because Qatar is too hot in summer, the World Cup is scheduled to be held in winter in the northern hemisphere. This is the first time in history that the World Cup will be held during this time period.

The 2022 World Cup kicks off with four matches on Nov. 21 and ends with the Dec. 18 final. The opening match will be held between the [Netherlands and Senegal](https://www.nowgoal.com/football/match/2185073/analysis).

Out of all the countries that made it to this stage, there are at least five of them who are considered favorites to win the cup by the end of it.

The 2022 World Cup is just five months away.

France will go into the tournament as the defending champions.

Les Bleus defeated Croatia 4-2 in the final four years ago. They will be one of the favourites to defend their title in Qatar.

But there are multiple other sides that will fancy their chances of emerging victorious.

Brazil are stacked with talent and will be tough to beat.

Argentina won Copa America in 2021 and recently dismantled Italy in the Finalissima. Lionel Messi will be 35 when the tournament kicks off and will be inspired to perform in what will almost certainly be his last World Cup.

Spain, Germany, England, Netherlands, Belgium and Portugal also have what it takes to triumph.

I was travelling to an old miners village with my engaged girlfriend. I played the guitar and wanted to meet with my friend Max from my old school band. He spoke very softly and it was comforting to hear his voice after so long of not speaking to him. As we spoke about the weather and how the rain had fell onto this village in the afternoon, He then told me about a place that was up on the hill. It was the old town hall. He said that i was invited to come. All the members of the village would have a meeting there. I was more than excited to meet some new people as I booked a hotel here for a couple months and it would be great to get to know the fellow members of the town aswell as old school mates. Max told me that he had planned a couple things that we would do in the town. One was going down an old mineshaft. Another was taking a small boat on the river. Max was wearing a tuxedo and took me to a bar. We drank wine and spoke about the woman in our lives. Max spoke

‘You still with mary’

‘We actually got engaged’

‘Oh really, you see, outside news doesn't get to this town often’

‘You never really left’

‘It never occur to me, i already love the river and mountains around here’

‘I always wanted to leave this place’

‘That not surprising, after all that happen’

‘Well it was unfortunate, but the memories are still layed in this place, it was always a special town for me. Even after all that happen’

‘Greg, your father was…’

‘Its alright max, thank you but lets move on to something else’

‘Greg your right. Atleast the wine has arrived’

Later that evening we walked down the street. The lights flicked and the rain was pouring but Max had an umbrella.

‘We are having a gathering at the town hall tomorrow’

‘With all the old families from the town?’

‘Yeah, i know you would be uncomfortable but i really think it would be great if you join us’

‘I’m a bit busy tomorrow, mary is taking us up the mountain to the snow’

‘It will only take a couple hours and mary can come, there will be music and a dinner’

‘What should i wear’

‘The suit that you are wearing will be fine’

I talked to Mary about this place and she was keen to meet with my old mates from school because she has never met them.

We walk into the townhall. Our coats are taken from us and out on the side. Everyone is sitting at the table. We took the middle spot.  I spotted max and told him 

‘This looks amazing’

‘Only the finest for our guest’

I started eating the first meal. Cutting it with a knife before a bell rang.

‘Welcome one and all, especially our new guest, greg and mary, my name is james and lets thank john for out food’

The old man bows to him and the chef bows back as we all clapped.

‘Now Each month we play a game. Those who wish not to play, raise your hands. Once the game start, it cannot stop’ 

No one raised their hand so the game began. Old man spoke again’

‘Lets the games begin’

‘Greg you can start as you are our guest’

I reply 

‘What do i have to do’

He responded 

‘Pick a person’

‘Ok, i pick max’

‘Great pick’

Max please step outside. Max spoke

‘Very well’

The old man spoke again.

‘Heads down’

The door open again. I could hear two footsteps of people. The old man spoke again.

‘Max nominate someone’

‘Well I have to repay the favour. I pick greg’

‘Very well, greg put your head up and come to front’

My head came up and i saw a person blindfolded and gagged tied to a chair. There was a box on the table.

I walked up to the front and next to the blindfolded person in a chair with ropes around the person. The old man said

‘Open the box’

I looked inside. At that moment I panicked and said,

‘Sorry guys, no, no, I have to go.’

‘Oh but you can’t leave so soon, we just started’

‘It my bad, it's late and we really have to go’

Mary put her head up.

‘Greg, what's happening?’

‘We have to go mary, we need to get to the ski resort tomorrow, sorry max’

The oldman rang the bell then spoke.

‘I afraid that won’t be possible, once the game start, it must finish’
 
I grabbed Mary and we walked to the door but it was locked.

‘Let me out’

‘Can’t do it sorry’

‘Do it or i smash this vase on this man head’

‘Go ahead’

‘Very well’

I smashed the vase but as i hit his head, it was a form head that rolled off and realised it was a mannequin. they were so lifelike that i didn't even notice. The old man spoke again. ‘The only way to leave is to shoot the gun to kill one person in this room’. Max walked up to the oldman. They then walked out by opening the key to the door. We ran up but he closed it before we could do anything. A couple seconds later,  We punched into the wall only to see that metal lined the wall and the doors were also made from the same material. We spoke to the person who was tied up and cut his ropes.

‘Hey, can you hear us.’

‘Help me’

‘How did you get here’

‘My name Richard,  i was travelling in my ute when a limo swerved in front, almost crashing into a car on the other side, i got in front of him and tried slowing him down but he wouldn't stop. Then he just stopped so i did too. I pulled over. I got out of my ute and walked up to the limo then i was attacked with a needle and a guy with a pig mask’

It took a long time but after almost a week and a half.
Me and Mary decided to plan to use the gun. We got it and pointed it at the man. He begged

‘Please’

‘Why shouldn't we. They said it's the only way out’

‘I want to see my son again, i beg you’

Hungry and out of options I pulled the trigger. It fired. Then I heard laughing. Everyone from the dinner came in. You won 100,000 dollars. Max said ‘We have been watching three couples try this experiment. None of which did it as fast as you guys. This is a livestream on the dark web and you guys get the prize pool. Well done.’ The old man said ‘To keep the prize and your lives, you must never speak of this again.’

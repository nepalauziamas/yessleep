When i was 16 my friend bought a Ouija board. We thought it would be fun to play at her house that is far out in the country side. We had no clue the history have to house or it would go. 

We sat on her bed the 2 of us alone in a dim room. We set the mood for it of course. I didnt believe in ouija I realize now how dumb i was. We messed hour for hours nothing serious happened we talked to ghost go bored and moved on to the next spirit. The last spirit of the night his name was rj or thats the name he gave us. he wouldn't tell us if it was a nickname or his real name but we went along with it finally interested in a spirit.

After half an hour talking to him I jokingly said "this has been so much fun will you be my husband" he said yes so i continued to joke. my friend did the dumb do you take this person through thick and thin sickness and health thing and we both said I do. I then go "oh no i forgot to ask do you like animals" he said no. I fake cried for like two seconds then said well we're gonna have to get a divorce then. He said no and then the planchette went to goodbye. 


I moved on and didnt think much of it. It's been 4 years i havent been able to get in and stay in a relationship since that night. Ive had 28 relationships. One time one of the guys said he couldnt be with me because he kept on having nightmares of him being murdered. Another said being around with me feels like being with someone elses girl. I have many many more excuses for why they can be with me some very valid like. One guy kept on getting someone bruises and cuts people were wondering if i beat him. Or the opposite with a different guy i got so many bruises and cuts people were accusing him of abuse.

 I some times see rj or think I do he appears as a handsome blonde white man in his mid to late 20s. normally hes just standing somewhere watching me or sitting next to my favorite spot on the couch ive seen him in my bed a few times as well. one time i swear I saw him look into my room.


None of that is whats really weird though because all of that I can write off on my crazy imagination. But I have dreams of him every dream ive had since that night hes been in it in one way or another. I used to feed into him give him energy and attention but I went to a medium 2 years ago. hed throw things and scratch me or bruise me and he even messed with my cat. poor minnie she is terrified of him she used to cuddle with me every night and I could almost never get her to leave my side when i was home sometimes she goes back to her old self. I like to think its cause he doesnt have to energy to bother me any more. 


I know its probably not true though because hes still very much around and recently hes got worse hes stealing my energy. I slept for a almost a week last week I had to beg my boss not to fire me. Minnie broke her foot some how and is now terrified for the couch which used to be her favorite napping spot. I had a guy over to hook up with and he left with a weird bruise on his stomach after a nightmare. Safe to say I wont be hearing from him again. I feel like I'm losing my mind I for some reason dont wanna leave my house any more. maybe its because i have no energy but what i do know is i hate leaving but once im gone I dont wanna go back.


Im a social person but I like to have balance of hanging out with friends the few i have and being at home. Last night pushed me so much closer to my breaking point I saw rj watching me while I cooked then again while i ate and once again while getting changed. This is the first time ive seen him mulitple times in a while. Then I felt someone behind me in bed and when i got up to go pee my tv remote hit the back of my head. My t.v. remote was flat on my bed when I got up i made sure of it.when I got onto rj he pushed me down. 


Im not sure what to do he's attached to me not the house me I didnt live at the country house and ive moved since then. My friend who was there that night has agreed to watch minnie for a while so i can figure things out. I'm gonna call a priest and a whole bunch of other spiritual people to help me . I honestly just want my life back im 20 now I havent had a guy last longer the a week since i was 16. My cat hasnt been the same in year and is now getting hurt. I can't deal with this any more but i also dont want to hurt his feelings. 


I feel weirdly attached to him even with all this chaos even with wanting to get rid of him. Deep down I dont want him to leave. I like having him around. I like him.

[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark/comments/imzy2g/tales_from_a_small_town_if_a_stranger_wakes_up/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) | "I don't care if it's a guy or a girl, but if it's a Lewis, you're not gonna put your dick in it," I overheard Donovan tell Remmy. 

At the age of thirteen.

When you live in Raw, there are some things that are just common knowledge. The sun rises each morning, Mr Jones' liquor store opens at three in the afternoon, the Lamberts go fishing every Wednesday and the Bennetts hate the Lewises. 

When I first came here, I had no idea where this deeply rooted sentiment came from. I would hear Donovan go into angry tirades about this other family on an almost daily basis. At first I didn't dare to ask about them at all. Siobhan however eventually laid the whole story upon me. 

It appeared this feud had been going on for longer than any living member of either family could remember. I believe it started as a simple rivalry. Both the Bennetts and the Lewises had always been keeping orchards to guard their property and the borders of Raw from the creatures living in the mountains, they just took different approaches. While we have an apple orchard, they focus on shrubs with all sorts of berries. These bushes of theirs are so incredibly high in places that they are basically a wall of thorns, which is an arguably better protection than our rows of trees. The idea in itself is pretty smart, even Donovan is willing to admit as much, but the problem as he puts it is *that it was the Lewises' idea*.

Now, since I'm with the Bennetts and I love them dearly, you won't find me going behind their backs and talking to a Lewis, so I don't know how exactly they feel about the whole thing. They do try to slash the tires on Donovan's car at least once every other month though so I'm just going to take a wild guess here and say they don't like us either. To sum it up, we're the two largest families in town. Either of our properties border on the mountains, so the entire town of Raw lies between our two separate farms. For one, the residents trust us with keeping an eye out for any dangers coming from the mountains, however that also means that they're in the direct line of fire of our dispute.

These fights could take on minimal just as well as enormous proportions. For example, one time Vasily and I went dancing in one of the bars in town–for the record, we only have two bars. One is Dante's, the most popular place for everyone to meet up, and the other one is a college bar type of thing named Hoots. The majority of patrons there are younger folks who just want some music to move to and aren't necessarily there for the cheap drinks.

So we were in there just having a good time when out of nowhere, Rory Lewis showed up and called me a fatass. Of course, Vasily wanted to get back at him, but I didn't so I grabbed him by the arm and started to drag him outside. He tried to struggle but eventually gave in and confined himself to yelling something along the lines of, "Least she got a pretty face! I'd hire Matilda to haunt a house!"

Matilda is Rory's sister and while I'm not one to put other girls down, Vasily has a point. Although I might just be saying that because she's a Lewis.

The thing about these smaller arguments is that it really messes up our families' flow on the few occasions that we're supposed to work together. Since either of us are keeping an eye out on either range flanking the town, communicating would make things a lot safer and easier. However since the only reason the Lewises venture out to our place is to key our vehicles and because the only times we ever call them on the phone is when we come up with some good new prank calls, it's safe to say neither party is very passionate about it.

The closest we ever got to one another was probably three years ago.

It all started with Donovan, Vasily, me and a bag of dogshit. We set out under cover of night, taking turns in carrying the bag, each of us holding it as far away from our noses as possible. In there were the combined feces of three large guard dogs; it was basically Pandora's box but with odor instead of plagues. This little gift was meant for the Lewises, or rather the Lewises' car to be exact. It had begun with them spray painting a very crude depiction of male genitalia on the hood of Donovan's car, and now he was out for revenge.

We quietly made our way over to the other side of town. The streets were dark and empty and there were only a few lights on in some random windows. Most residents had already gone to bed hours ago. My eyes swept past the town hall–the large building stood out imposingly, almost threateningly against the night sky. A queasy feeling was beginning to grow in my stomach, but I forced it down. This was about our honor as a family; a challenge that demanded satisfaction–or in this case, crap under the car hood of an old, mean grouch. 

Fortunately for us, the Lewises kept their dogs in a backyard separate from the front of the house where their vehicles stood, which meant it was unlikely we would alert them. So there we were, finally. 

"Gloves," Donovan ordered in a low voice. Vasily nodded and reached into his pocket, proceeding to pull out the pair of gardening gloves we had "borrowed" from Siobhan. Donovan pulled them on with a deadpan look on his face before making his way up to old Ted Lewis's blue truck. After some fumbling, he managed to get the hood up and waved us closer. I could see him lick his lower lip in excitement, his eyes faintly twinkling.

"Now the crap." 

I wordlessly opened the bag for him, suppressing a gag once the odor emanating from it reached my nose. Donovan, utterly stoic, reached inside with both hands. We could hear a loud splat as the dogs' feces landed in the dark space underneath the hood. Donovan quickly and quietly pressed it shut again and marched over to the back of the car, bending down to reach the tailpipe. He grabbed a handful of shit again and shoved it up the tailpipe as best he could. 

He straightened up with a satisfied smirk on his face, offering both of his hands to us for a high five, but we told him it wasn't going to happen before he'd taken off the gloves. 

"Hey kids," he suddenly spoke up. We were already getting ready to book it but something appeared to be bothering him. "Is it just me or is it quieter around here tonight?"

"What do you mean?" Vasily asked, raking a hand through his jetblack hair. Donovan's tone was enough to have both of us feeling uneasy. 

"This ain't the first time I've been around the Lewises' at night. These folks don't train their dogs right. Or at all, probably."

He was right. The Lewises' dogs are some moody little bitches, always looking for trouble and barking at anything that moves. "You think something's wrong?" I offered. 

Donovan reached up to tug on his lower lip, a telltale sign of nervousness of his. Thankfully, I could stop him before he could do so. "The crap," I reminded him in a low hiss. 

"Oh, right," he muttered, letting out a relieved chuckle. "You're a good kid, Peps. Can't believe I'm actually getting worked up over the Lewises' dogs of all things. Come on, you two, let's get moving."

"Wait," Vasily chimed in, "I think we should check in on the dogs. It'll only take a second and it's kinda crucial after all. It's enough if one of us just goes around back real quick. Don't have to be all of us." 

"I'll go," I suggested hurriedly. "I won't be long, just check if those beasts are dead or not and we'll be on our way."

"Stay low," my father advised me and I nodded, ducked down and proceeded to rush around the corner of the Lewises' large house. It had some resemblance with our own, except that I like to think ours is a lot nicer. The same style and roughly the same size too though. Unlike us, they don't let their dogs simply run around and sleep in their yard. Instead, they built a large cage in the back of their property for them to do so, which in a way was practical since they were always closer to the mountains. 

Upon arriving in front of the fenced area, I instantly spotted three figures lying motionless on the ground. Their silhouettes stood out in the gray darkness. At first, I couldn't put my finger on what was wrong with them–there was something wrong for sure, I could see *that* much, but it took me another few seconds of staring until I realized that they weren't asleep. I get that all dogs sleep in different positions and while ours have always liked to curl up, I've seen them flat and stretched out before too. What I've never seen was any dog lying as stiff as these. They were completely soundless too–the night was quiet, yet I couldn't seem to hear any heavy breaths, little grunts or sleep-whimpers from them. 

I could feel my fingers quivering ever so slightly as I reached into my pocket to take out my phone. Turning on its flashlight and pointing it at the dogs on the ground, I instantly started to gag and before I could pull myself together, I bent over and threw up into the dirt. Breathing heavily, I straightened up again, spitting a few more times to get rid of the taste of vomit in my mouth. 

I could hear hurried footsteps approaching from where I'd left Vasily and Donovan, only to find both of them running towards me. I simply pointed at the cage, trying to avoid looking at it again. My brother couldn't say a word but Donovan managed to force out a quiet curse as he laid eyes upon what I'd discovered. 

The dogs' bellies had been slit open, their innards laid exposed. Their tongues were hanging from their open snouts. 

"Who did this?" I whimpered, pressing up against my brother's chest and hiding my face in his jacket. 

"Kids… I think we need to check inside," our father muttered. We exchanged worried glances. There were only a few reasons why somebody would kill a family's guard dogs. Perhaps they were what had been stopping them from making their way inside their house. As we made our way up the Lewises' porch, we found it open just a crack. Donovan, who had his bowie knife on him as always, readied it on his belt. 

"You think I should run and grab your shotgun?" Vasily offered. 

"No time," he replied. "It'll be enough though. There's three of us. Be careful, you two." With that, he pushed against the door and it swung open with a loud, drawn-out creak. There was not a single light on inside. We took a few hesitant steps into the darkness.

"Lewis?" Donovan called out, his firm voice masking his unease. 

No reply.

We made our way through an empty hallway I had never seen before and I stifled a gasp when I bumped into what must have been a small cabinet or something. We didn't have to go too far to find our rival family though. 

It was the dimly flickering light of an oil lamp that drew up towards them. We found them in their kitchen, all set around their large table like they were about to take in a meal, despite there not being a single glass or plate. There were the parents Ted and Aster, Rory and Matilda and even the three younger members of the clan, Sven, Hazel and Melissa. None of them were moving and at first, I thought for sure they were dead. All of them had their eyes wide open, looking glazed and empty, and all of them were facing the single source of light; the oil lamp in the middle of the table. 

It was only when I caught young Hazel blink that I realized they were in fact still alive. I let go of a relieved sigh only to tense up again. What was going on here? Of course, it was Donovan who first dared to raise his voice. He began by clearing his throat, but received no response whatsoever. 

"Ted?" he then spoke up, addressing the silent patriarch. 

Ted Lewis's oily graying hair was hanging down into his face, making him look even more ghostly than his blank stare already was. His wife sat across from him and when I took a step around the table to get a better look at her, I found her to be just as still and frozen as Ted. The scowl which I was accustomed to seeing on Matilda's face had faded and she was gazing at the burning flame as vacantly as her siblings and parents.

"I'm scared," I uttered breathlessly, glancing over at Donovan. It was the easiest, most simplistic and yet also the most honest way I could describe what I was feeling.

Donovan reached for my hand and gave it a gentle squeeze before stepping up to Ted Lewis. He slowly waved his hand in front of his face, trying to get a reaction. He then rested his large palm on the old man's shoulder, prodding it slightly. I rounded the table to get over to Hazel. Her tan skin seemed to glow in the eerie warm light, her large brown eyes remaining wide open as I leaned over to face her. The young girl had always been the kindest of the bunch. She'd even tried to talk to Carol once when I was with her. Both my sister and I were really surprised at her approach, pleasantly of course, but before the girls had the chance to exchange more than a few words, Aster had showed up and called her daughter back to her side, seeming rather angry.

"We gotta get them outside," Donovan murmured before lifting his head. "Pepper, go back to the orchard and bring back one of our dogs. And hurry. We need to keep this side of the town covered somehow as long as they're out."

I nodded and instantly sprinted out the door and off into the direction of our home. I'm not in perfect shape, but I've always been a good runner, so I managed to get back to our house in around twenty minutes. I chose to bring Hades with me to the Lewises' orchard. He was already close to my heart back then and generally very sharp and alert. He looked very confused upon finding me slipping into his cage and quietly calling him, but willingly came trotting towards me. He happily ran alongside me as we took off, probably excited to be taken on a surprise walk. 

When we arrived, we found Donovan and Vasily standing over the members of the Lewis family, all of which either sitting or lying completely motionless on the ground. Vasily was just wiping the unresponsive patriarch's forehead with what looked like a wet cloth, but to no avail. Upon noticing me and the dog, my father came up to me.

"You got Hades, eh? Good call. Listen, Peps, your brother and I need to get these guys to the doctor. Got the keys for their other truck from inside. I trust you, so I need you to stay here and look out for the mountains until the sun goes up. Shouldn't be long now and we'll come back to get you as soon as we've explained everything to the doc anyways, but if you don't want to, I get that. You can come with me and Vasily can stay here instead if that's what you want."

I shook my head. "I'll be fine. Not on my own after all." I gestured towards Hades. "Just make it quick, alright?"

"Will do. One more thing. If something from the mountains should come, don't try to fight it. I found Lewis's shotgun and put it out on the chair on the porch for you, but that's just if everything should go wrong. In case Hades does notice something and it's not too late yet, go hide inside. It's safer." 

I told him I'd be careful and quickly grabbed the gun before rounding the house and sitting down with my back leaning against the fence of the cage the dead dogs were still in. Hades was sniffing the air and trotting to and fro in front of the cage. I tried to keep him from freaking out by calling him to my side and petting him, telling him it was okay. We spent what felt like an eternity watching the mountain range from afar and I was grateful for every minute that went by in silence. I feared that any second, Hades would pick up something coming down to us and start barking. The thought of the mangled corpses of the dogs in the cage behind me was gnawing on my mind and my head was running wild with images of the creatures from the hills. 

And yet, I could only sit and wait, my dog's comforting warmth by my side and my heart pounding in my chest. 

As the first tender rays of sunlight pushed their way through the jagged stone walls protruding from the desert and encircling the small town, I could hear the Lewises' truck, driven by Donovan and Vasily, pull up in front of the house. I got up, trying not to look into the cage behind me, and went to greet them.

"It's been quiet, thank God," I told them. Vasily let out a sigh of relief. "So what did the doc say?"

The look on Donovan's face darkened. "It looks sorta like they've been poisoned. He said some stuff about their pupils being dilated and their blood pressure being off so it'd point to some kind of drug. Now, I doubt getting high and staring at a lamp is some regular family activity for them." He cleared his throat. "Tricky thing is, an attack on one of the border properties means an attack on Raw. Doc said it was either us, but probably not since we helped them, or somebody tried to get them to drop their guard so the beasts could get into town."

"But wasn't that a bit of a sloppy job then?" I argued. "If I were to take down Raw's defenses, I'd focus on both border orchards equally."

"That's the thing," Vasily chimed in. "It looks like someone set out on a mission here but abandoned it halfway through. Doc already said he'd tell the mayor so there's gonna be a town meeting soon. I was thinking it might have been… you know." He shot Donovan a grim look. I knew who he meant. He's careful not to drop that name when I'm present though.

Thankfully, our father immediately shook his head. "Leslie Torres is Old Scratch incarnate, but no. This ain't Leslie's doing."

I tried not to look as relieved as I was about this. Donovan is usually right about these things. The town meeting was held a few days later but no one had very much to contribute. I suggested we'd try to get a hold of the Sheriff–maybe he'd seen someone suspicious. Nothing ever came of it though and after another month or so, the incident had faded from the residents' minds. The Lewises recovered and in the week they needed to get new dogs, we had Eden over at their orchard to keep watch. And that was that. It's odd how these things just happen sometimes.

The blue flower leapt at the red and yellow ones, knocking them back with its tube and tendrils. It gave Stephanie and me a few seconds to shake up our spray paint cans. We sprayed them at the red and yellow flowers, who recoiled. The blue flower didn't seem to mind as much. Curtis was visibly upset by the smell as well. Stephanie advanced, stepping around the blue flower and spraying the paint at the red and yellow flowers.

Most of the paint was ending up on the furniture or the floor, but a little bit got on one of the red flowers. It reacted in a way none of us was ready for, spitting acid back at Stephanie. The acidic saliva nailed her in the face, causing her to scream and drop the spray paint can. Curtis laughed. It was the first time in my life I had ever heard someone do an honest-to-God evil laugh. Like a cartoon villain. I came closer and sprayed paint at Curtis directly, reaching just above the tubes of the red and yellow flowers as I did.

One flower's tube lunged at my hand, but I pulled back. Another spit acid. I ducked but a little landed on my shirt. I fell back and started frantically pulling my shirt off. Stephanie was lying on the floor and screaming. Curtis was flailing around like he had caught fire. The red and yellow flowers were slowly backing out of the room, apparently unable to stand the smell. The blue flower pushed past me and bit one of the flowers with its tube, if that's the right word to use for something that has no teeth. It pulled on the stem of the yellow flower until it snapped off. The flower went limp. Now there were only two red flowers and one yellow one.

I pulled my shirt off and turned to Stephanie. She was still writhing and screaming. Curtis and his flowers had backed over the threshold of the room. I kicked the door shut, aware the Curtis could reopen it any time he wanted. The blue flower slumped slightly, looking almost dejected. I think it wanted to have a go at the other three flowers. Stephanie was screaming loud enough that she could probably be heard in the next building. I looked around for something to ease her pain and found an opened bottle of water on her roommates desk. As quickly as I could, I opened it up and poured it over her face.

The water seemed to ease the pain but not make it stop. I could already see burn marks forming on her face. The acid had gotten in her eyes, which was very bad. Also, the paint fumes in the room made it hard to breathe. I sat Stephanie down at her desk and opened a window. She groped for a second and found the box of tissues that lay in the corner of her desk, pressing the tissues to her face. After a minute or two, she seemed to calm down.

"Does it still hurt?" I asked.

"Yes," she said. "I can't see."

"We have to get you to a hospital," I said, doubting that they would be able to fix her eyes.

"How are you going to do that?" she asked. I turned around and faced the door. The blue flower lay on the floor like a dog waiting for its owner to come home. Something inside of me gave way. I crossed the room and opened the door, limping slightly on my injured foot.

Curtis and the three flowers were in the hall, Curtis having removed his shirt and thrown it several yards away so that he wouldn't have to touch the paint. The flowers raised their tubes at me but didn't spit acid. I think they were as surprised by what I was doing as I was. Curtis and I faced each other, two shirtless men in the hall of a mostly empty college dorm.

"What is it you want with me?" I asked.

"What makes you think I want something with you?" he asked.

"Cut the crap," I said. "I know it's me you want. I heard about everything that happened with Francine."

"Maybe it's not you we want," he said with a shrug. "Maybe it's your roommate."

"No," I said. I didn't believe him but I wasn't exactly sure why. Pavel was a decent fellow. But something told me that whatever Curtis and Roland had wanted, it was not with him. Once or twice I had caught Roland staring at me. Initially I thought he found me attractive, although I think that was just my ego talking.

Curtis reached out and took my hands. He examined them like he was doing a palm reading. "You have very soft hands," he said. "I can see it even across the cafeteria. My hands are all hard and callused. It comes from all the time I spend in the woods climbing trees and stuff." I didn't know he liked to climb trees, but there was a lot about him I didn't know.

"What's your point?" I asked. "You want me to climb a tree with you?"

"No," he said. "I want your hands. I want to trade hands with you. I want my hands to be soft again. So I can show my kids how much I love them." He reached out and tried to pet the red flower. It pulled away. Curtis looked hurt. For an instant I almost felt bad for him. He was deranged, but he thought of these flowers as his own creation. It wasn't good, but it made him more understandable.

"How does that work?" I asked. "You want to just cut my hands off or--"

Curtis blinked. "No," he said. "Nothing that vulgar. It's a spell. I draw a circle, we get inside, and I say the right words."

"Does it hurt?" I asked. Was I seriously considering this?

"Oh, yes. But it's better than if I take your hands the other way. Roland wanted your eyes, but he's not really going to be needing them anymore."

"No," I said. "This is insane. You're fucking insane. I'm not giving you anything."

Curtis gripped my hands tightly. He had a strong grip. "It's easier if I don't have to force you, but the ritual will work either way." He was about to continue when the blue flower lunged at the remaining yellow flower. It had propped the door open with its own body and sat watching us talk for the last minute or two. I could not tell how much it had understood.

"No," said Curtis as the flowers wrestled. The blue flower was bigger but it couldn't seem to catch the yellow one's stem with its tube the way it had with the last one. "Break it up, guys," said Curtis, but the flowers ignored him. He tried to pull them apart with his hands. His back was to me, so I laced my fingers together and clubbed him on the back of the head with both of my hands.

The thing about fighting is that unless somebody really knows what they're doing, it usually just ends with the two people rolling around on the floor. I witnessed an actual street brawl when I was in high school and hanging out in a rough part of town. It was over in seconds. The bigger guy threw the smaller guy against a car and kicked him twice for good measure. That was it. The smaller guy survived but I have no idea how long it took him to recover, if he ever fully did. Anyway, Curtis and I rolled around on the floor. He got on top and punched me, then shook his hand when he realized how much it hurts to punch someone in the face. I think the two remaining flowers were about to spit acid at me when Stephanie came out of the room with a can and started spraying them with it. They didn't spit at her again, but just fled.

Curtis got off of me and followed them, leaving the blue flower and the yellow one to fight for themselves. I reached down and grabbed the yellow one's stem, twisting it with my hands and pulling until it snapped in two. The flower went limp. I didn't feel good about having killed something that clearly had a mind and desires, but there you have it. Curtis fled the building with the two red flowers. Stephanie stood facing the wall where she had sprayed all the paint. Her aim had been pretty good considering that she was just guessing, but she'd still gotten some paint on the wall.

I heard the sound of sirens. The guy who had seen us fleeing down the hall must have called 911. I assume it was him, anyway. The blue flower looked at us and leaned its tube against my leg. I pet it one last time. Then it slithered away and down the stairs. I believe it headed off into the woods, but somebody later told me they saw it heading in a different direction than Curtis and the other two flowers. Nobody saw Curtis or the red flowers again.

"Go back to your room," said Stephanie. "Just tell them you were listening to music really loud."

"Are you sure?" I said.

"Yes," she said. "Thanks for your help." I leaned in and kissed her on the cheek, right below her burns. It just felt like the right thing to do. Then I turned and walked down the stairs shirtless and barefoot. My room was exactly how I had left it. I changed clothes and waited for somebody to knock on my door asking me if I saw what happened. Nobody did, so I just grabbed my towel and shower caddy and walked to the next building over to have a shower. My foot was feeling better. The burns were minor anyway.

The official explanation for what happened that night was that Curtis and Roland were doing science experiments in their room with chemicals Curtis had stolen from one of the labs on campus. Curtis was a chem major, so that wasn't as big of a reach as one might think. I don't know what Stephanie's explanation for why she had spray-painted her room was. Maybe she told them that she knocked on Curtis and Roland's door, one of them threw acid in her face, and she had sprayed paint everywhere out of sheer frustration. All I know is that she had to move into housing for students with disabilities now that she was blind. I went to visit her once, but I'm not going to say what we talked about.

Believe it or not, things returned to a relative normal fairly quickly after that night. Nobody moved into Curtis and Roland's room. That door stayed closed for the rest of the semester. Sometimes the shower drain would get clogged by loose hair or I would hear loud music coming from someone's room but couldn't pinpoint where. People came by to look at the destroyed room from the outside sometimes. If anyone asked me, I just told them that I had been listening to music on headphones and hadn't heard a thing. Pavel seemed almost jealous that he had been away when he heard what had happened.

This was almost ten years ago. I'm in my late twenties now. If you ever see a gigantic blue flower slithering along on its roots out in the wilderness somewhere, don't be afraid of it. Avoid Curtis and the red flowers. But the blue one is lonely. I hope it finds some company [eventually](https://www.reddit.com/user/_Cu_Chulainn17).

Hey, I told myself I wouldn’t rely on this stuff for help but I don’t know who to turn to anymore. Let me start from the beginning.

My names James, I’m 32 years old and my wife, Isabella, is 28. She and I have been married for about 3 years. She’s a generally nice and caring person, she’s also very smart and is very careful. Recently her actions have made it seem like she was never any of those things.

Anyways one day we were watching a horror movie, my favorite genre. It’s not often we watch this because she’s scared, so I was surprised when she even bothered to recommend it.

“Why? Not that I’m opposed, you just never usually go for horror.” I had to ask of course. But she just shrugged, taking the popcorn out of the microwave and walking to the living room, of course I followed, enthusiastic about this new found Isabella.

“I haven’t decided yet, but I’m stuck on American psycho, or classic Halloween.” I looked at both the disc.

“You can never go wrong for choosing a classic Halloween movie, stalking and killing.” She smiled, but it wasn’t her usually gentle smile, it was a weird, eerie smile. Kinda like the ones you would see in a horror movie where the psycho grins in front of their prey.

I shrugged it off and decided not to think much of it since she seemed excited. While watching the movie though, I noticed something weird about my wife. Usually during the gory scenes, she would look away or gag, again it’s just how she was. This time was drastically different. She watched intently, like as if she were taking mental notes. After the movie had ended I was tired, I checked the time and it was already 1 in the morning.

“Alright babe,” I kiss her cheek, “let’s get ready for sleep. I don’t want you too exhausted for work tomorrow.”

“Yeah,”she said quietly following me. Again, she was different and acting strange, I decided I’d talk to her about it tomorrow, but by morning she was already gone. I texted her telling her we needed to talk and that I was worried about her. She read it but didn’t respond so I assumed it’s because of work. This was normal, her reading but not responding, but something still felt off.

Maybe it was wrong of me, but I decided to rummage through her stuff, seeing if she was hiding anything or doing drugs that I wasn’t aware of. After finding nothing I gave up and went for a walk instead, and even hung out with my best friend and his wife, telling them about the strange occurrence that happened last night with my wife and I.

“Maybe she changed her mind, who knows! It’s like my wife with murder podcast these days.” He laughed and I laughed with him but I still wasn’t convinced. It was getting late and my wife was about to be home, I bought Chinese food and thought she’d might want something simple. I set up the plates and the dinner table and then the food. By the time she got home she seemed exhausted, but also excited.

I placed her plate on the side of the table and she pulled her chair to sit behind me, holding her plate of food and eating. It felt like she was staring so I turned around to find out she was staring. I was creeped out of course and got scared but I didn’t say anything, instead I finished eating and then started doing the dishes. Putting her plate in the sink, she sounded like she walked away, maybe this wasn’t too much but I was still relieved. She was really creeping me out.

I turned around to grab whatever was left and again, there she was, directly behind me.

“God damn it! Isabella, you really fucking scared me.” I put my hand over my heart and breathed heavily, my thoughts scattered at what just happened.

“Boo.” She said quietly, making her way upstairs, I’m sure she was still smiling. Though it’s too soon to say, my wife was horrifying to me now. After I did the dishes I walked upstairs, and went to take a shower, I thought I heard the shampoo drop so when I went to check, instead of seeing the wall, I saw my wife, she scared me so bad I fell out of the shower and on the floor, badly hurting myself.

“Isabella!” I yelled, but all she said was boo, with that wicked smile, and walked out of the shower, still in her clothes and drenched. I quickly locked the door, in panic that she would follow me again, directly behind my back. When I got out the shower, she was already in bed, sleeping. I got in next to her and turned to face her.

“Hey Isabella?” I silently called for her name but she didn’t respond. I started gaslighting myself and thinking, she’s just having fun. She’s usually not playful but she’s trying something new clearly. I turned going to sleep, but I had trouble, I had a feeling she was staring at me, and when I turned to face her, she was, she was mainly devoured by our blankets but she was staring at me with wide eyes and sinister smile. My heart almost stopped with the fear that she caused me but I stayed calm.

“Isabella we need to talk.” I said more confident in hopes she’d actually pay attention, “you’re scaring the shit out of me and I got hurt, is everything alright are you just trying something new?” She didn’t respond, instead she frowned and turned away. I fell asleep later, still feeling her eyes on me, but I tried my hardest to avoid at all cost.

The next morning, she wasn’t there, but I was paranoid, believing she was there, directly behind me and watching me. I constantly take quick turns but she would never appear. As soon as I heard the front door open, I went to go greet her, but she wasn’t there, she left the door open so I shut it and called for her. I suddenly had that heavy feeling that someone was behind me and when I turned there she was, again.

“Isabella this needs to stop! You’re terrifying me.” Instead she stepped aside smiling, pretending to walk away, I turned knowing she was behind me, “what are you doing?” But all she did was tail me from behind and stare, with that wild smile, even while eating she didn’t take her eyes off of her food, mindlessly she ate and ate until she figured there wasn’t anything left. She waited until I left or walked away to follow me.

I couldn’t take it anymore, one night while I assumed she was sleeping, I ran out the house and tried my best to just go for a walk, but again, I got the heavy feeling she was behind me, paranoid, I turned but she wasn’t there, but I kept turning around, thinking maybe she’s following me fast. I panicked and started running as far away from her as I could. Asking people if she was behind me, but no one saw her. Every person that passed me I asked, and every person still said no. I know she’s behind me, she won’t stop following me.

So please anyone, please I’m begging you, what do I do? Why is she doing this? She’s always behind me. I think she’s behind me right now.

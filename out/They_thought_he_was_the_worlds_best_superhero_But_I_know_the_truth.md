No one remembers him any more. Which is strange since they were once enamoured with him. When I say his name—cursed as it is—they call me crazy.

But it still is in my head, clear as crystal. And tomorrow they are shipping me off to the psych ward for the criminally insane. Which was ironic since he sent so many people there for doubting him.

Reddit, you are my only hope. He’s long gone, but when he comes back, don’t fall for his lies. Please.

I still remember the date when he arrived on Earth.

**March 10, 2022**. 

The day that asteroid landed on Earth. The day which changed mine—and everyone else’s lives forever for the ‘better’.

It came crashing down, red-hot, right on the lawn in front of the White House, sending plumes of smoke that could be seen for miles.

I arrived there at 8am, one of the last reporters to see this extraordinary miracle. The president was staring at this huge smoking black rock, rubbing his eyes and yawning, probably wondering if he was dreaming.

“This is extraordinary!” I exclaimed, gesturing frantically to my cameraman, Joey, to start filming and not just stand there with his mouth open.

“No one has predicted this. Scientists from all over the world are scratching their head, wondering how and why it is here. We…”

A hiss made me spin round. The front of the rock was sliding up, revealing a plethora of equipment and technology, some of which I couldn’t place a name to.

“Martin Meyers, Eyelight News, Washington D.C.” I finished hurriedly, holding my breath.

A man stepped out, grinning as he basked in the morning light. Or was it a man? What kind of man could casually stroll out of an asteroid anyway?

He was tall, and thin, with a crop of black hair that swept over his forehead. But that was where the similarities ended. His skin seemed to be made of plastic that stretched and moulded over him, and his teeth were way too white and in a perfect line.

He was dressed fully in black, complete with a superhero cape, with a red J right down from his chest that shone like fire.

The man strode over to the still-dumbfounded president, shaking his hand, and then ruffled my hair like I was his brother, and with a quick *may I borrow this, my dear Martin?* snatched my microphone from my hands and leaned in close to the camera. Joey’s hands were shaking and his pants were growing increasingly wet.

“My name is Mr Justice, and I am here to save your world.”

And just like that, the entire world fell in love with him, especially after he stopped crime after crime. Mr Justice was unstoppable, even better than anything Marvel or DC could dream up. Whenever they saw him flying across the sky, they would scream and faint in joy.

I will admit it—I, too, got swept up in the excitement. I will not lie when I said he changed my life for the better. My steadfast reporting on his success snagged me a promotion and a pay raise in less than a month.

I never could be happier.

When was it that I realised it was all wrong?

I think it was the day when I was informed of my promotion. I was looking forward to the weekend and planned to take my girlfriend Lulu out to celebrate. My head was spinning, giddy with joy at the news. I was at an all time high and nothing could bring me down.

Friday nights were always so busy and bustling. Cafes were alive with movement and laughter, relaxing against streaks of red and gold. I strolled back home, hands in my pockets. My backpack was slung over my shoulder and I had ordered a sourdough pizza back home to celebrate.

Halfway back home a man stumbled in front of me. He was a shapeless mass of clothes too big for him and his face was covered in a rough stubble. Blood spilled out of his mouth and eyes and down his pale face.

I jumped back, blinking rapidly, my heart in my throat.

His lips twisted into a crimson smile. Then he erupted into a fit of raucous laughter, holding his hand to his stomach, before collapsing onto the floor. I watched as his fingers dissolved into his blood, and then his arms and legs, until his head remained, which then rolled to my feet.

I peered at the direction he had come from. It was a dingy alley, the darkness exploding out into the vibrant sunset. I *know* this alley, used to rush through it whenever I was late for work. I know the folk that made this alley their home. Folk who were so cheerful, so good-natured—but unlucky enough to fall below the poverty line and without a home.

Now blood was creeping out towards my feet and soaked into my shoes. The alley stunk of death. A flash of red caught my eyes and I looked up to see two red eyes and a J that shone like fire.

I was aware that I was standing there too long. *Move along now* he seemed to say. *Move along.*

I couldn’t eat that night. The sourdough pizza tasted like cardboard in my mouth and my mind kept on flashing back to the alleyway. To make it worse Lulu wasn’t in for dinner. She left a night saying she had gone out with another boyfriend (just to try) but I was too numb to care.

The next day Mr Justice said in a public statement that he had solved America’s homelessness problem, and when statistics were run on Monday they realised what he said was true. There were exactly zero homeless people left in the United States. As the main Mr Justice correspondent I had to write about it, but as I sat in front of my computer my mind flashed back to that alleyway and my stomach churned.

The office was surprisingly quiet today. I had always liked the peace and quiet and it had gotten even better when COVID hit, but today half the desks were empty. All the girls mostly. It was like they had collectively decided to sit out of work.

My boss was on the top of his game today, yelling at us to work doubly hard to get out the latest story about Mr Justice. But I could see it in his eyes, the way his hands shook and his voice wavered. The stress of having fewer employees than normal was getting to him.

I was glad when work ended. I desperately wanted to go home early but my boss was watching me like a hawk. I packed up and caught the earliest train home.

Lulu was waiting for me. She was smiling slightly, but she looked so far away. She had prepared dinner, some kind of pasta, and a rose was sitting in a glass vase.

“Thanks Lulu,” I sighed. 

Lulu didn’t respond. Her eyes refocused somewhere on my left. She was still smiling, red blossoming on her cheeks, eyes rolling back into her head.

“Is there anything wrong?” I frowned. “Where have you been anyway?”

“He invited me out again. But he told me to drop by your place first.”

“Uh, who?”

“Mr Justice,” she sighed, like they had been dating since they were babies. And she giggled again, a silly, childish giggle, and all of a sudden she ripped apart her blouse to reveal a shakily carved heart beneath her breasts. Blood flowed out into little rivulets so it looked like the heart had little spidery legs.

“See ya,” she giggled, buttoning up and leaving. My heart turned into knots as I watched her leave. Then it stopped cold when I saw the rose.

A twisted mass of intestines curled up onto a vine that was way too green.

***

Do not ask how I found out where Lulu and Mr Justice had their date. It was just that what Lulu said after she left haunted me the rest of the evening. I spent many hours using my research skills to track her down.

I found myself at the outskirts of town, outside what seemed like a factory. It rose up before me, a black shadow illuminated slightly by the moon. It looked abandoned by the dust gathering at the gate, or what looked like a gate. Someone had smashed his way through.

Probably Mr Justice himself, who wanted to make this his home. But I had a sinking feeling he wanted to lure me here.

The interior was the same as the outside: mostly machines that did not work. The lights were broken too, but shining my light around I saw something that made me scream.

I don’t even know how to describe it in words. I don’t even want to relieve the details because it gave me nightmares for life.

It was just…body parts. All sorts of body parts. Legs and arms and an open chest cavity with various beating hearts. They were all bound to each other with ropes of intestines that were tied squarely into knots. And I *recognised* who they belonged to. There was Good Joe, who always had stories to tell from his time at the military, and the toothless guy next to him who was always sharing his food with me although he was always hungry.

And on top of all that there was Lulu. Or rather, Lulu’s head. 

The thing that was now Lulu giggled and sat up. In fact everyone was laughing. All the body parts were laughing.

I shakily tried to take a few photos but a hand shot out and squeezed it until it was a useless mass of iron.

“I wouldn’t do that if I was you.”

His voice was silky-smooth as always, like liquid chocolate. He strolled casually out of the shadows and though his hands were normal, his face had morphed into a gleaming mass of tentacles.

He chuckled, looking at his newfound creation. Lulu was still laughing.

“I tried making myself a sandwich today. Easiest time I ever had!”

Mr Justice leaned over and those tentacles opened wide, revealing the sharpest teeth I had ever seen in one smooth circle.

Then he leaned over and bit her head off. And chewed. And chewed. I wanted to run forward and tear them apart but something was keeping me there. My heart was in my throat.

Then all of a sudden he spat it out. Acid sizzled at my feet.

“All this work! All this preparation! The study of this superhero culture humans are crazy about!”

He was pacing now, ranting like a lunatic.

“ONLY TO TASTE LIKE THIS??”

Then he grabbed my shirt. His face was steaming red. Acid burned my arm. My face was white as hot breath oozed up my nostrils.

“And you! You ruined everything!”

He sneered back at me, and stormed away.

His last words were a dagger to my ears.

“As for you…something must be done about you…”

He roared.

“I’LL BE BACK!”

What happened next was way too fast. I found myself blinking back at my home with no memory of how I got there so quickly. I squinted in the early morning light, which pierced through my eyeballs.

Mr Justice’s furious face still haunts my mind. Every day.

As I said before, no one believes me when I talk about Mr Justice. I can’t even find proof on the Internet. And I know. I have been trying for two months.

Not even the police. They laugh at me and remind me that prank-calling them is a crime.

Superheroes don’t exist, they say.

I’m made to go to counselling. They nod, their fingers clicking on pens and scratching on paper, but I can see the skepticism in their eyes. The I’m dealing-with-someone-crazy look.

Superheroes don’t exist, they say.

But I’m certain. I know this because I have never seen Lulu again. Or those lovely folk on the unlucky side of life. When I walk down that alley, all I can hear is the wind whistling in my ears and the leaves dancing down the street. 

And most of all, a fresh gift from him on the dining room table. Sitting in a glass vase every night.

I was so thrilled to see “90’s TV shows,” as one of the categories for pub night trivia. Me and my friend Kate have been meeting up every Tuesday for trivia at our local bar.

“Oh my goodness, I loved those shows!” Kate said. “Sister, sister, The Steve Harvey show, So much fun!”

I squinted at her, trying to determine if she was messing with me or not. She just stared back with that goofy smile full of perfect teeth. Not wanting to wait in the uncomfortable silence anymore I started to tell her that is not exactly TGIF, but she cut me off.

“Relax, silly billy. I know they were not technically “TGIF,” but they were 90’s. The category is 90’s TV shows, not just the ABC lineup on Friday night.” She took a sip of her margarita, blowing the remnants of the empty straw near my face.”

“Gross!” I tossed a napkin at her in retort. We laughed and continued our conversation. She was right though; I’ll give her that. This category could contain all kinds of wonderful 90’s shows. Man, I loved that time for television. I’d think about it all day. After school I’d catch whatever show I could. I’m not that old (late 30’s,) but where I grew up was pretty remote. I didn’t have cable until I went to college. We had the archaic 3 channels on the dial. Thankfully though, they did play the iconic shows I still love to this day. 

“Oh shit, we almost forgot to submit our team card,” I said. Kate, mid-gulp, put her drink down and furiously scribbled out our name on the trivia card. “Strawberry High.” We came up with this after a long-forgotten drunken conversation one night. We both attended Stephenson High school and somehow, we came up with a joke calling it Strawberry high. Neither of us remember exactly how, but the name stuck with us. After being out of high school for over 20 years it’s a wonder that we still live somewhat close to each other, and still get out to trivia almost every Tuesday.

She hurriedly threw the card on the MC’s table. She scooted back into our booth, flashing me an excited grin. “Let’s do this, brutus!” she said. Perfectly timed, our shots arrived. I lifted the lemon drop, as she did hers. “To Strawberry high.” Clink. Drink. Ready.

“Ok trivia peeps, welcome back to another round of pub trivia. Hope y’all doing just fine on this Tuesday night. The feeling is right and the mood is light. Let’s go!” Kate and I laughed as we always do at the host’s “signature,” intro.

“Question… number one. She played the mother in “Step by step,” one of the signature shows in the “TGIF,” lineup.

Before I could even say anything, I saw Kate’s expression. “Go ahead,” she said with a sigh. She didn’t want to hear “I told you so,” about the TGIF thing.  
 Ms. Suzanne Somers, I said out loud while writing it down for our first answer.

“Alright folks, get ready for your second question. How many children grew up in the Tanner household in the San Francisco-based show Full house?” “Original cast, folks, original cast.” I saw her immediately scribble a number down. “No, no that’s not right I said.” Kate scrunched her brow.   
 “Uh, it’s absolutely right. Two older girls, and the twins. The whole show as based on basically being a house ran by men who were raising girls.”

“I’m not arguing the living situation, my dear, but there were only three girls.”

“No, dummy, D.J. Tanner, Steph Tanner, Mary-Kate and Ashley. I forget their names on the show.”  
 I laughed. I looked up from my beer. Kate looked kind of perturbed. 

“I’m not laughing at you, but I think you forget that Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen played one character. “Michelle,” was only one child played by the twins. Remember that young kids have pretty strict rules about working hours. In the show it’s only one character, played by two twins.”

Kate threw her head back in embarrassment. “I’m so stupid. You’re right, of course you’re right. As always.” She gave me a wink and erased her original answer of four and replaced it with the correct answer of three. He said original, so I assume were not counting the other set of twins that actually made an appearance on the show. The boys, I don’t know their names. “You win again,” she said, with another smile. This time accompanied with her tongue sticking out.

Three questions later and the short round was over. Five out of five. Off to a great start.

The next few rounds were not 90’s related, but we did well just the same. Finishing second out of 10 teams. Not bad. We’ve never placed higher than 3rd so this was a best for us. A few more rounds down and we decided to call it a night.

“Next Tuesday?” I said. “Next Tuesday,” she confirmed. We hugged and left in separate ubers. As her chariot passed me I could hear her yell out of the window: “Long live Strawberry High!” 

As I laid down, I reflected on another great night out with an old friend. I was also flooded by nostalgia of my childhood. All those great shows, all those great times. Saved by the bell, home improvement, Family matters. The list went on and on. Good clean entertainment. I don’t know what kids watch these days but I know they are missing out.

I’m woken up by a screaming alarm. The sound is ear-piercing. I groggily reach out to shut off the insanely loud screeching. As I catch my bearings, I see my alarm clock. It’s a Sony, white alarm clock. I got one just like it on my 13th birthday. What the hell? I must still be a little under the influence.

I popped a couple Excedrin, brushed my teeth, and hopped into the shower. Already feeling better, I grabbed the clothes I set up last night. Khaki pants and a .. very large white button-up shirt. I don’t remember that. I don’t even think I own something like this. No more shots on Tuesday night trivia.

Walking down the stairs I was hit with an incredible aroma of pancakes, meats, and fresh fruit. The dining room table was packed with a feast to make the best chefs in the world envious. Did someone break into my house and.. make all of this? Stacks of pancakes, bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs, ham, every breakfast staple represented. Even boxes of cereal with carafes of cold milk. A child, maybe 10, darts out of the hallway. He grabs a piece of toast, smiles at me, and darts toward the front door. He slings a teenage mutant ninja turtle backpack over his shoulder as he runs out. I don’t have any kids. I live alone. I briefly consider calling the Police. Some family, or some intruders, have infiltrated my home. I decide instead to retreat to my bedroom and grab my phone. Where is my phone?

I finally found a phone, but not mine. It was plugged into the wall. Now this.. this cannot be right. I looked at the relic from another time before trying to call Kate. There’s no screen on it. I can’t search kate’s number. I can’t pull up google. I can’t.. do anything. Thankfully I actually know her number by heart, and punch it in.

Ring… ring… ring… no answer. I almost hang up when I hear the message. “HEEEY, it’s K! You know what to do.. BEEEP.”

I clear my throat. Um.. yeah, hey. I don’t know what the hell is going on but what did we do last night? Please call me back, I think I’m in someone else’s house, everything is- BEEP. The call cut off. An eerie nostalgia washes over me. The moment suddenly becomes real. I have a real phone in my hand. A phone that is as long as my head. The buttons, the mouthpiece, the ugly beige color. It was all too. . . real.

“Come on sleepy head, you’re going to be late for work,” I hear coming from downstairs. I cautiously put the phone down on the bed and peek my head around the corner. I see her at the bottom of the stairs.   
 A blond woman. Pretty. She has a jean skirt on and a pretty offensive blouse with a jean vest over it. I don’t mean that there’s any offensive words written on the shirt or anything, it’s just obscenely ugly. And who is this woman in my home anyway.

“Don’t look at me like I drank your last Fruitopia! Come on, your breakfast is getting cold. 

“Fruitopia?” I put my gigantic khakis and white button-up shirt on and cautiously head downstairs. The blond woman is shuffling the last two children out the door, giving them each a brown paper bag for lunch, I assume. There was more than the one kid I saw here? I start to really fog up now. Just as I hit the dining room floor, the woman spins around with an unnatural smile. “Good morning mister, nice of you to make it!” She says to me.

“Who are you?”

*A distant chorus of laughs erupt in the distance*

“What was that, who is that, who else is here?” I demand.

“What was what, sweety”

I heard laughing. Why are you doing this to me? What did you do to me last night?

She cocks her head to one side, crossing her arms in an overly dramatic pose.  
 “Hey, don’t have a cow man!”

*Louder chorus of laughter can be heard*

I need to sit down. It is very hot in here all of a sudden. I look up toward the ceiling to see nothing but light. That can’t be right, like my entire ceiling is one giant fluorescent sun. She comes toward me, pointing to her watch.

“You’re going to be late baby, and don’t forget today is the day you ask your mean old boss for a raise.”

I start to respond, but before I do a voice from the darkness interrupts.

“*Get her into makeup.* *Her head is shinier than Dick Vitale standing in the middle of the damn desert.”*

Before I can make sense of what I believe I just heard, I see this lady, my “wife,” get snatched by two men dressed in all black. They have headsets on, and I only just get the smallest of glimpses of their side profile. I can’t determine if they were wearing some kind of mask or are actually inhuman. I stand, frozen, not sure what move to make now. I went from mildly on edge, believing I was still asleep participating in a hungover fever dream, to defcon freaking 5.

“*Back to one.* *Get the energy up.* *Aaaand action..*”

A bright light shines on me from the darkness. Um.. uh…  
 My wife gets shoved back into the house, stumbling to my side. I see it. It’s in her eyes, real fear. But only for a nano second. In an instant her cold scared blue eyes warm up and that fake smile spreads once again.

“Tell Mr. Johnson what for! You deserve that raise and he knows it.”   
 She hands me a briefcase. I still haven’t moved. 

She goes in to kiss me on the cheek. Reflexively, I move my face to meet hers. Her intended target of kissing my cheek ends up landing her lips on mine. We do an awkward closed mouth kiss.

*oOooOOOOOhhH!*

Some strange oohing and gasping comes from the ether. I did not kiss that woman on my own accord. She puts her hands on her face like she was embarrassed and kicks one of her legs up behind her before running off into the darkness.

Her voice appeared somewhere off-stage.   
 “Don’t forget, we have tickets to the Bullets tonight, love ya!!”  
 The bullets? That isn’t right.. not that any of this is.

“*And cut.* *Commercial break.* *Take 5, do not move.* *Cue theme.* *Everyone get happy.* *Now.*”

A strange feeling starts to overcome me. Freezing me again. I could feel people watching me as the camera zooms in to my terrified face. Shakily I read my next line:

“Ok, Mr. Johnson, you think you’re all that and a bag of chips, well I deserve to get the big promotion. And if you don’t think so, you can talk to the hand!”

*WOOOOOOOO. Overwhelming clapping and ovation.*

I think this is all in my head. I hope so. I hope you see this somehow. I’m writing all of this down. By hand, mind you. Someone here told me I can fax it somewhere and they can publish it. I don’t understand, but they made it make sense to me. Hope someone sees this. I wish you could also see this fun little “S” doodle I’ve came up with.. so much fun. Pretty rad.

To start off I always enjoy youtube videos of users like Mr. Nightmare reading these horror stories. However, I'm afraid I've gotten way more than I asked for with indulging myself in the paranormal. I've lived in the Appalachian Mountains all my life, in Pennsylvania. I am a 21 year old female college student trying to enjoy my Junior year Summer and what not. My boyfriend and I invested in a large tent and lots of camping gear this Winter and it is currently June, so we decided to start camping out in different places. His brother's backyard is the woods located on a large mountain with a valley down below. This traumatizing event occurred last night and the night before foreshadowed the absolute horror movie hell we experienced last night. 2 days ago we set up the tent in his brother's backyard to party and stay in there as we felt it was very safe right in his backyard. The first night seemed calm at first. His brother chilled in the tent with us watching movies and drinking for a while then headed inside his house to go to bed around 1am. Right around the time he went inside my boyfriend and I heard what sounded like a baby crying in the woods. I dismissed it as a bobcat with wishful thinking. We later realized that this sound had ended up foreshadowing the scariest experience of both of our lives that occurred last night. We both brushed this off and went to sleep even though my boyfriend continued to talk about it and how scared it made him even though he does not scare easily. I wanted to enjoy the tent we invested money into so I ignored it, sort of a big mistake. We spent the next day at a lake and had a great day, which looking back now we were likely being stalked unknowingly by this non-animal creature. Around sunset we relaxed in the tent. Myself, my boyfriend and his brother are very into watching horror movies but do not scare easily. We watched Don't Breathe 2 and had trouble deciding on the second horror film to watch. Looking back now it seems that we didn't need to decide on a second horror movie since around 2:30 AM we were quite literally woken up inside of one. To give a clear picture of who was involved in this story before telling it I'll mention that his brother, his brother's girlfriend, and their roommate stayed inside the house this night. Meanwhile, my boyfriend and I were out in the yard in a large RV sized, sturdy tent. Now to begin this horror game simulation we verbally agreed that we had woken up into. My boyfriend woke up in our fully lighted tent at 2:30 AM to what he described as "zombie sounds" growling and grunting walking from an old barn near their house to the exact place on the tent where our heads were rested on our bed. The creature then pushed on the tent right above his head a couple times. This is about the time he got me to wake up. My body instantly went into fight or flight as I heard the inhumane, not even animal-like noises and tones coming from this creature dragging it's claws around the tent. I prayed it was a black bear at this point over anything else since we typically have black bears here in Pennsylvania and they get frightened by humans, especially when you sternly enforce them to leave your tent. But this creature was instantly pissed off walking in circles around our tent grunting and squealing like it was thirsty for our blood and wanted nothing else but us. I would settle my mind by telling myself this was an animal, but due to a detail I will later include it simply isn't possible and could only be explained as paranormal. The animal scratched and screamed at our tent completely unprovoked until it reached the entrance point that had an unsealed bottom and vertically zipped down. My boyfriend jumped up as we realized it was trying to get UNDER the entrance and IN. He punched at it through the tent and yelled at it like a dog "GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE" and it ran off once. We shook in fear for about 5 minutes until hearing the thing come back to the side of the tent angrier than before. This is another point where we realized this is not normal for our local bears and the creature reached the top of our tent when it was scratching and the tent which keep in mind is 8 fu\*king feet tall.. We were helpless at that point and called his brother who did not answer, so we then called his brother's girlfriend who by a whole miracle had answered. I took the phone crying for help telling her to come out on the deck and tell us what was outside our tent. The creature tried to get in again and right then we heard the sliding door to the deck and porch light turn on, but the creature had disappeared into thin air. She was pissed off and said there was nothing out there. She went back inside and told his brother to come out and he did. He came inside the tent and we told him what happened. As he is someone with an open mind about these non-animal creatures in the Appalachian mountains we wanted to investigate. I hoped the story would end here and we would have just went inside and stayed na√Øve to the creature, they were not on survival mode like we were and found this just interesting unfortunately. All three of us walked out of the tent and had a hesitant look around. His roommate came out too and we waited in the dark to see if it would emerge from the woods. It sounded as if a woman had started screaming in the woods. This along with other blood-chilling sounds happened for a while as we stood outside. I went up to the deck to watch over them as they boldly walked around the yard and barn. After a while my boyfriend and his brother decided to go back in the tent and wait for it so he could prove to his brother how serious this was. After a while of watching over the yard I was convinced by them to come back in the tent. I went in and sat about 5 feet from the entrance whispering and scolding them on how this was not a joke. It was only 5 minutes of us in a vulnerable position again until his brother said "Shh I thought I heard something but I think it was just my coat rubbing on the chair" My boyfriend then said "No bro it blends in with the wind or something like it could be out there right now even if there's no footsteps" and suddenly I shit you not the whole entrance to the tent got kicked in and I jumped across the tent as they stood up to confront the creature outside the door. However, this kick to the door was the only thing that happened. No footsteps of it running away, nothing. Out of completely thin air like he said. His brother had never been more scared and was now convinced that this thing was something of the paranormal and believed it was a Wendigo. We all spent the rest of the night in fight or flight taking positions sitting in the tent, on the porch in the dark waiting, and inside looking out of the windows to attempt to get a glimpse of what this thing was. At one point his roommate walked around the property by himself and came back saying he walked toward one of the chilling screams we heard in the woods and saw golden eyes staring at him from the bushes. From here on this man was acting strange and trying to convince me to go back in the tent with them and that "it's safe now" when it clearly wasn't. We all picked up on his strange behavior and we kept knives on us just in case. It's crazy to think we had to but at that point with paranormal encounters, anything was possible in this horror simulation we woke up into. Until sunrise I stayed in the kitchen window watching the property and listening to the sounds of baby crying, woman screams, and "help me"' inhumane voices trying to lure us into the woods as the sun rose on the open land. When the sun was up at 6am I went to attempt to sleep in the tent with adrenaline nonstop pumping in my stomach. It's funny how when the sun lit the land this creature had completely stopped terrorizing us.

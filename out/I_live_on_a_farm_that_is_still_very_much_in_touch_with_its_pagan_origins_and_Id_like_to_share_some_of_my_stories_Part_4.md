The anniversary is over. The place where Maybe Uncle Pete is buried has, over the years, sprouted a rich crop of white clover that is more luxuriant than anywhere else on the farm. Out of interest, I googled the Language of Flowers, and it told me that white clover meant "Think of me". 

I was relieved to find that out. I could think of many things Maybe Pete might have tried to convey through wildflowers on his grave, so if all he is asking for is remembrance that is comforting. 

What shall I tell you next? Maybe about the copse. 

The copse is a patch of trees clumped in a compact huddle on the landscape, right on the edge of the land before it bleeds into the next property. It is longer than it is wide, and whilst it might have seemed like a good place for children to play, it has never been friendly. The trees are too close together, their bark too gnarled, and their branches intertwine overhead in a way that blocks out natural light. Even though it is theoretically possible to cross the breadth of the copse in minutes at a good pace, people who have gone in there have reported getting lost. 

I never went too close to it when I was little. My brother told me wolves lived in there, and I believed him so implicitly I often claimed I spotted large, shaggy bodies moving in between the tree trunks. It's possible I actually did see that. 

I was maybe 10 or 11 when I had my only run in with the copse. I had friends over, which now seems like a miracle. I think maybe they had a crush on my brother and that was the only reason they came over. It wasn't that I was unpopular, but the farm was. Nobody wanted to come here. 

We had been doing girl stuff. Talking about makeup and boys. But if you know anything about girls that age, you will know that they can be strange. Country girls even more so.

Growing up on a farm exposes you to the grim realities of life and death from an early age. You see the bull being taken to the cows and know it means calves eventually. You see a mother cow eating grass and feeding her calf whilst her back legs are drenched in blood. You see horses being gelded, and cattle being culled, and dogs shot for worrying the cattle. Farm life is unforgiving and I witnessed many things I only barely understood whilst also believing I understood them completely.

But that's just me. As we know, where I lived was different. Not every farm child has seen the Shuck. So maybe I was stranger than most little girls.

All I know is that talk eventually turned to my friend Sasha's crush, an unremarkable boy named Liam. We discussed his hair and his clothes and the way his nose wrinkled when he was confused - all the things Sasha believed were unique to him. It was my other friend Louise who brought up the idea of making a love potion. 

We were making it up as we went along. We had no idea what rituals or ingredients might be needed, but Louise spoke with such authority that we believed her. She made up some bullshit about apple peels and candles and mirrors, and ad-libbed some stuff about wild mushrooms and tree bark that made me think she was bullshitting further, but Sasha was so enamoured by the commonplace Liam that she was willing to try anything, and the upshot was that we all ended up roaming the farm grounds looking for fungi. 

I might have asked my mother to confirm what we were doing. I feel like she would have known. But my real fear was that she might have told us what was actually needed, and we may have ended up casting the spell for real.

Also, she might have told my father about my sudden interest in Boys, and I didn't want to have that talk.

We found all the mushrooms we needed, although Louise seemed indiscriminate about what type they should be. As long as they sprouted from the ground and we're vaguely fungal, she gave us the go ahead. 

We crawled through damp grass, muddying our knees and soaking our clothes, until Louise deemed that we had enough fungi. After that, it was only the tree bark we needed. 

There were plenty of trees around the farm, but Louise insisted we needed a special type - the type that could only be found in the copse. And of course they looked to me then. 

Their logic was flawed, but they said that if they went into the copse it would be trespassing, whereas if I did it, it would be fine. 

It made a stupid kind of sense, and one that I couldn't deny. I didn't consider that they might be scared. I knew I was. 

I no longer believed that wolves roamed there, and honestly if I thought there were wolves I would have braved the copse long before. I loved wolves. They might have been enough reason to enter that strange, dense space.

But without the possibility of wolves, I was fearful. I didn't want to lose face in front of the only friends that would come to my house, so I agreed to go despite my misgivings. 

They accompanied me right to the edge of the copse, stopping a few paces away and waiting expectantly. It was still daylight but all I could see was darkness ahead. 

I asked Louise what kind of tree I should take bark from, and she told me that any bark from the copse would be acceptable. There was an odd tone to her voice, one of horrified fascination that suggested she was more eager to see what might happen than for me to bring her bark. 

I gathered my courage for a moment, asking myself if I was really going to do this, and fixed my eyes on a tree right up ahead. It was a few feet further in than the trees on the very edge of the copse and I thought it would be acceptable. I thought it would show my bravery whilst allowing me an easy escape.

The first sensory messages I got when I went into the copse were from my legs. The ground was uncomfortably soft and spongy beneath my feet, and for a moment it felt fleshy. I thought of my nightmare from all those years ago, of the huge entity with antlers that had crashed through these trees, and imagined I was walking on some part of it as it slumbered beneath the soil. I trod carefully, for fear of waking it. 

I was submerged into a twilight level of darkness only a few steps in. The contrast was startling. The tree I had targeted was merely a dim outline up ahead, whereas it had been vivid enough from the outside, and it seemed further away than I had first thought. 

I could hear Sasha and Louise talking behind me, their voices hushed but normal, but when I took another step away from them that changed. They sounded muffled, as though I was hearing them through cotton balls stuffed in my ears. 

Another few steps took me level with the first of the outskirting trees. I did not want to look at them. I had a feeling that it would be upsetting - that there would be faces moulded into the bark of the trunks. Unpleasant ones. 

It was like being underwater. Deep down. The pressure grew heavier the further I went, pressing on on all sides. It was harder to walk, my legs moving more slowly, battling resistance. 

I'm aware all of this could be psychological. The copse had always been significant, and being in it could very well have caused psychosomatic responses, but it's hard to describe how real these feelings were at the time.

I panicked at one point, feeling lost, and turned around to make sure my friends were still there. They were, but much further away. I wanted to berate them for backing off, but closer observation showed me they hadn't moved. Their feet were still right on the verge of where grass became woodland, their toes just touching the brown treeline. It was me who had gone further. I'd only taken a dozen steps, by my reckoning, but still it seemed like I was looking at them through the wrong end of a telescope. I said their names but they didn't react, and I wondered if my voice sounded as muffled as theirs did to me. 

I pressed on though, through some misplaced bravado. Turned myself around and made my stifled way towards my tree of choice. I could hear noises, despite the cushioning in my ears, sharp sounds that I wouldn't have heard in the real world. Branches breaking. A low, subaudible hum that swelled the further I went. The copse was full of twisted life and I imagined zombie squirrels leering down at me from crooked branches, lopsided rabbits burrowing beneath my feet, their tunnels linking and spreading in a weird and powerful sigil drawn beneath the dirt. 

I reached the tree I had been approaching, pulled out the little paring knife I'd stolen from my mother's kitchen. It was small and old, but its blade was thin and curved from decades of use.

Louise hadn't specified how much bark was needed, so I hacked into the tree trunk with clumsy haste, not caring about the quantity as long as I could get out of there.

Sap began to bleed out immediately, far thicker and faster than anything I'd expected, staining my fingers. It was a rusty shade - not blood, although that's how it might sound. The smell that came from the sap was meaty rather than metallic, and had an acrid, almost singed aspect to it too. I wiped it off on my jeans, but a film of it still clung to my skin. Days later, my fingers would be red and sore, with little blisters that burst and scabbed. For now, there was merely an unpleasant tingle. 

The forest sounds pressing into my ears grew loader. There was a groan that could have been the creaking of tree trunks grinding together, and the tightly packed branches overhead squeaked and shuddered. I was doing something terrible, something blasphemous. 

I tore the rough chunk of bark away, getting splinters beneath my fingernails that I didn't feel at the time. I was unsteady on my feet because of the pressure in my ears, so as I turned away from the wounded tree I stumbled a little. At least, that could be what had happened. The other alternative was that whatever slumbered beneath my feet had stirred, disturbed by the voices of the trees. 

It felt like the ground rolled. I have never experienced an earthquake but I imagined this was what it felt like. 

I could see my friends up ahead - miles and miles away! - and struck out towards them. 

Their faces were masks of horror. They were clinging to each other like Scooby Doo and Shaggy upon seeing a ghost. I could see their mouths moving, but I couldn't hear what they were saying. It was drowned out by the sighing of the earth, the heartbeat of the trees, the internal scream I couldn't emit. 

If you have ever tried to run in a nightmare, you will know how sluggishly my legs moved. I focused on my friends. Their eyes and mouths were wide then, frantic and gaping, and some vast passage of air seemed to press against my back propelling me forward. I ran forever, but it was mere moments before I felt their hands on my arms, pulling me from the confines of the copse and dragging me away half on my knees. 

The second I was on the natural grass of the farm, all my senses returned in a rush that made me swoon, overwhelmed by the sensory impact. Louise and Sasha were jabbering at me in high pitched voices, and I became aware of the pain in my hands, the weakness of my limbs. 

I passed out a little then - probably for mere seconds, although it seemed like eternity - but my last action before I fell was to thrust my bark prize at Louise. 

We never ended up making the love potion. Louise put our ingredients in her pencil case, including the scrap of hard earned bark, and we buried it by the barn with a certain amount of ceremony and never spoke of it again. They did not come to my house again either, although I was still welcome at theirs. 

During one such visit - a sleepover at Sasha's - we talked about what had happened in hushed tones as we lay in our sleeping bags with the lights out. My memory of events was exactly what I have told you, but they had more details to add. They told me they had screamed because they had seen something behind me as I ran from the copse. They were unable to describe what they had seen in any coherent fashion and they both disagreed on the sighting, but both confirmed that something had been right behind me. 

Sasha said it looked like the trees were chasing me, as if they had pulled up their roots and become mobile. Louise said that what Sasha had seen had in fact been an immense limb pushing up from the earth,  swatting blindly at the air as I passed. 

Both descriptions seem plausible. Maybe both had happened. 

I did go back to the copse a week later, once my hands had healed. They no longer hurt, but the skin on my fingers had died and sloughed off, and I was still picking at bits of dead skin as I walked up the hill. 

I had no intention of going into the copse. I wasn't stupid. But I wanted to see if there was any evidence of my intrusion. 

The tree I had targeted was exactly where it had stood before, and from the edge of the thicket I could see a raw patch where I'd torn the bark away. The exposed area was pale, streaked with the rusty sap, and the irregular shape I had hacked almost looked like a face. Almost. 

That was the closest I ever got to the copse after that. I had never felt myself in  such danger as I had in there. Even taking into account everything else that has happened on the farm, that experience remains unique in that respect. 

My hands have become sore again writing this. A memory, perhaps. So I will stop writing now. Next time I update, I will tell you about the Shuck. I know you must be eager to hear.

****

The next time I came back to my own body, there was a noose around my neck.

If I’d put myself there, it wouldn’t have been a big problem.  There was a small stool under my feet, and while yes, my hands had been zip-tied in front of me and the rope bit into my throat even at my full height, I could have stood and breathed semi-comfortably for minutes or even hours.  I already suspected that’s exactly what my body had done while she had been inside.

But I hadn’t put myself there.  And every time we swapped, there were those few seconds of vertigo and imbalance before I needed to vomit, and just like the nausea, it was getting stronger every time despite me knowing it was coming.

I’d been in the middle of recording a long confession video this time when it happened.  I’d debated whether to risk provoking her further by trying again to get her arrested, but in the end I’d decided I didn’t have much to lose.  She was dangerous and crazy, and if I didn’t get her first, I would just be waiting around until she figured out how to get me instead.

So when we swapped this time, I’d gotten her ID card again so I could remember her name while I was there and headed out to an electronics store.  I considered just using the camera on her phone or computer, but I didn’t want it to be something she would be able to find or manipulate or explain away.  My plan was still in flux as I used her credit card to buy a mid-range digital camcorder and a memory card, but by the time I got back to her house I’d settled on making a detailed recording recounting the limited amount I knew about the dead man from before while making vague statements about other people she might have hurt or killed.  I’d also hold up her ID and show enough of her house that there’d be no question that it was her.  Then I’d email it to whatever local police department, set up an email and email it to myself, and then mail the memory card to myself too.

I shot the video three times.  It’s hard trying to act like you think someone else would act inside their body, especially when you want to appear both believable and unfeeling.  She needed to come across as the sociopath she was, not some attractive but troubled woman that would either be pitied—or worse—not believed at all.  I was in the middle of the third take when the world began to turn inside out again, and the next second I felt my feet slipping off of their perch even as the rope bit into my throat, cutting off my air.

I almost died right then.  *Would* have died if I hadn’t managed to hook two of my fingers between the noose and my neck.  My wrists were bleeding from the ziptie and I’m pretty sure I dislocated those two fingers, but it all happened so fast and nothing else mattered except getting off that rope.  I didn’t have enough leverage to lift my head out, but I could turn enough to get a couple of breaths while I looked around for something to boost me up more.

There was nothing, or so I thought at first.  She’d cleared everything out of the way to make sure I didn’t have a way out.  Or almost everything.  Because I did remember standing on something when I first came back.  A chair or stool maybe.  I couldn’t look down, but I stretched out my toes, gasping for a little more air as I felt everything growing fuzzy.  My toe hit it, and when I stretched further, I hit it again.  I found out later the stool was laying on its side from where I’d knocked it over, but I pushed it enough that I could get the ball of one foot balanced on the edge of the seat.  Just for a couple of seconds, but it was enough to let me yank my head free and fall crying to the floor.

Several minutes passed before I started getting myself together.  Lungs and throat still burning, I looked around the room for anything else she might have done.  That’s when I saw my phone in a little tripod holder I’d never seen before, its camera lens aimed at me.  She had been recording it all.

I watched the entire thing.  It was almost four hours long.  I guess she went right out, got that tripod, and came back and set everything up.  Said what she wanted to say and then got up there.  Got up there and just waited.  Waited for me to come back and fall.  For me to die.

I…I don’t expect you just to believe any of this.  I know you trust me, and I don’t think you think I’m crazy or on drugs or something.  Not normally, at least.  And even watching the video, you might just think it’s me.

Because she’s right.  She’s a lot better at this than I am.  At *all* of this.  I spent a couple of hours trying to make a convincing confession video, but looking at this video she recorded…its long and weird, and its surreal because I know it *isn’t* me, but not because she’s not acting the part.  Her movements and mannerisms, even the way she talks…I don’t know how she’s done it, but I think she’s found videos of me and studied them.  Even I can’t tell the difference most of the time, and I know the truth.  

There’s just one thing right before the switch back that…but no, I need to shut up and let you notice it or not for yourself.  If I suggest stuff to you, you may doubt yourself, and that won’t help you believe me.

*”What do you mean?  Are you sending me the video?”  I’d been silent through Taylor’s story, not because I didn’t have questions, but because I had so many.  He believed all of this, or if he didn’t, he was doing a more convincing job of lying to me than I thought he was capable of.  But now he was talking about this video, and if he actually sent it to me, it might help me understand what was actually going on.*

*”Yeah.  I’ve been uploading it to a cloud folder while we talked.  The fucker is 182 GB, so it’s still going to take a few hours.  But you should have the email link already.  Just give it until in the morning and check it, okay?  I know it’s long, but watch it and then call me back when you can.  Please.  I don’t know what else to do or who else to tell.*

*”S-sure.  I mean, of course I will.  But are you okay right now?  I mean do you need some help locally or need me to call…”

*”I’m not crazy.  Just…just watch it.  Maybe you’ll see it wasn’t me.”*

*And then he was gone.*

**** 

I did as I promised, and by midmorning I was watching the video.  It started with Taylor adjusting the phone so the camera had a clear view behind him.  I could see where an eyebolt had been screwed into the ceiling and a thick nylon rope had been strung and tied through and fashioned into a noose.  Further down, in the very bottom of the frame, I could see the edge of the stool that had saved my friend’s life.

My stomach churned seeing all this, and I almost turned it off and called him back or called his parents.  But they were in Michigan, and none of us could reach him in time if he wanted to hurt himself.  Maybe if I just listened to him and watched the video, I could figure out a way to actually help him.  It was then that I realized he was talking now.

“…been really hard lately.  France is great and all, but it’s lonely.  And it’s all gotten to be too much.”  He looked away and gave a small, awkward laugh like I’d seen him do a hundred times.  “So I think it’s time to hit the road, Jack.”  Frowning a little, he looked back into the camera.  “I’m sorry.  Goodbye.”

With that, he went back to the stool, climbed up on it, and stuck his head through the noose.  After he tightened it a little, he pulled something from his pocket.  It took me a moment to realize it was a zip-tie.  Making it into a large loop, he slipped his hands in and then gripped the free end with his teeth, pulling until it was tight against his skin.  All of that was horrible to watch, and I had to keep reminding myself that he was okay, that I’d just talked to him, but none of it was as bad as what came next.

He just stood there, silent and staring, looking through the camera at me as the minutes crawled by.  There was the occasional twitch or shifting of weight, but that was all.  Just a motionless statue, staring at me for over three hours.  That might sound boring, but I watched every second.  Not just because I said I would, but because something told me I need to pay attention to everything.  Maybe just so I could say with a clear conscience that my friend was delusional, but…

Wait, what was that?

The moment was brief, and then Taylor shuddered, pitching forward and then back like a fish on the line as his feet kicked and knocked over the stool he’d been standing on.  His hands went instinctively to his throat, and I saw exactly what he had described.  Him fighting for air as his struggled for something to stand on.  Finding the stool for just long enough to escape the noose and fall to the floor.

I was crying a little myself by the end.  It was hard seeing him go through all that, even in the past, but it wasn’t just that.  It was that I was terrified.  Terrified because I thought I was starting to believe him.

That moment…that brief moment before he began to thrash and fight for his life…I thought maybe I imagined it, but I watched that little bit of it twenty times after the video was done.  In that second before he started to hang himself, his expression had changed subtly.  A small thing that you wouldn’t notice if you weren’t paying close attention.

A little smile.  No.  A smirk.

**** 

I tried calling Taylor back the rest of the day, but I only got voicemail, and my texts and emails didn’t fare any better.  I told myself I was giving it until the next morning and then I was getting on a plane and going to check on him in person.  None of my plans or good intentions helped me sleep, of course.  Or made me feel less guilty when my phone rang again in the middle of the night.

It was Parisian police.  Taylor had fallen or jumped off of a building, the same building he sometimes worked from and had access to, though no one knew how he’d gotten up to the locked roof in the middle of the night.  I was numb and in shock, but I still asked if they had any suspects or idea that maybe someone had done it to him.

They said no.  That from what they had found, he had tied a rope around one of the ventilation pipes up there and held onto it while leaning out over the edge of the building.  They didn’t know why he hadn’t just jumped, but security footage showed he’d held on to the rope like that for over half an hour before suddenly letting go.

Something else occurred to me then.  Why had they called me about this?  Had they called his family or anyone else?  I was one of his best friends, but still, why me?

Because, they said, when they looked at the video, the hand not holding the rope had been holding his phone.  He’d stared at it the entire time he was suspended out in the night air.  The camera wasn’t at the right angle to show what was on the phone, but when they found it near him on the pavement, it was broken but not dead.  And when they plugged it up, it lit up on what they think was the last thing he looked at before he died.

A picture of me.

**** 

That happened three weeks ago.  I’ve been questioned by law enforcement in two countries and Taylor’s parents multiple times.  Did I know he was going to kill himself?  Did I know if he was on drugs?  Did we have some kind of weird suicide pact?  The questions got stranger and stranger as they got more desperate for answers that I couldn’t give.  Not because I didn’t have them, but because they wouldn’t satisfy.

I wasn’t satisfied either, of course.  And at first I was angry.  Either my friend was having a breakdown and I didn’t do enough to help, or he was telling the truth and someone had murdered him.  Either way, I buried myself in watching the video again and again.  Looking for more signs to go along with that damned smirking smile.  I finally caught something else, but it wasn’t enough to convince anyone of anything.  All it did was make me more sure someone was out there.  Someone I didn’t know but that could theoretically already know about me.  And I didn’t want to draw more of their attention.

So I decided to let it go.  I felt like a coward and shitty friend, but I told myself it was all pointless.  That even if it was true, I wasn’t going to fare any better than Taylor had if I tried to track this person down.  And how could I?  I had nothing to go on other than what he’d given me, and it just wasn’t enough.

But then I woke up in a strange room.

It was foreign to me, but still strangely familiar.  Not because I’d ever been there or even seen it, but because Taylor had described it so well.  Trembling, I got out of bed, ignoring the strangeness of my body and movement and…everything…until I made it out to the mirror in the hall.

I was in her.  Oh God, I was in her.

I kept looking everywhere at once and my heart felt like it was going to burst, but this wasn’t a dream and I was in her and how was this possible.  How would it be me now?  

Then I noticed the red letters in the corner of the mirror.  Written in lipstick were two lines, punctuated at the end by a small smiley face not unlike what had been scratched into Taylor’s hand between his index finger and his thumb.

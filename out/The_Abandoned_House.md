I just left the police station and told them what just happened but more people need to know this.

I was hitchhiking at a gas station, the time was around 10pm, a forest with very tall trees surrounded, the road and gas station are the only sign of civilization.

I had been at the gas station for an hour at this point, hardly any cars passed by in this time so I figured I would be there for awhile. After another half hour I decided to go into the small diner in the gas station.

When I entered there was only one person there but there was something off about this person, their head was down and I couldn't see their face but I decided to overlook it for now and get some food.

After I had my food I went to the bathroom before attempting to hitchhike again but when I got into the stall I heard someone enter the bathroom behind me.

 As i finished and was about to leave the bathroom stall I then heard a slow knock on the stall door, "knock..... knock..... knock" I asked who was there while looking at the large shadow and shoes that were under the stall door but I got no answer from the man but suddenly he left and I was left confused by what happened.

I decided to leave the bathroom stall and I saw no one there so I decided to just forget it and go back to the diner.

I paid the check and left to buy snacks in the gas station and go back outside to hitchhike.

I was outside trying to hitchhike for 22 minutes and a truck driver approached me and said he was heading towards New York and asked if I was headed towards the same area, I was, so I decided to go with him and we left the gas station.

After 1 and a half hours of silence we were still in the forest so I decided to try make conversation as we hadn't for much of the trip so far and I asked him "what are you transporting?" But he told me "not to worry about it" so I was a bit put off but I figured I should try to forget it and try get some sleep.

I woke up and the time was 4 am, we had stopped and the driver was missing.

Outside was so dark,I couldn't see anything outside the truck and outside the truck I heard whispers and I then heard the truck cargo doors slam shut so I decided to go outside and see where the driver was.

As I stepped out I went towards the truck cargo doors as I heard them slam shut just moments ago so I figured he was there checking the cargo, when I got round there the truck then started up again and began to drive away.

I tried to chase it and I shouted as loud as I could but the driver didn't hear me.

I was left alone in the dark but at that moment the clouds cleared and a bright full moon lit up the ground and I saw I was still in the forest but there was something else there.

A house, I saw a house in the moon light but it was abandoned and it look like it had been for a very long time.

I went to check inside my bag but I realised I left it in the truck and I only had my phone and at the time I had no phone service but of course I do now.

I went inside the house and figured I should wait for morning so I entered the house and as soon as I did I got this awful feeling like I was being watching. Little did I know at the time, I was.

I decided to sleep for awhile but I couldn't for 45 minutes and it was now almost 5 am and I decided to look out the window since I couldn't sleep anyway and then I saw it.. dozens of people staring at me wearing creepy masks that were highlighted in the dark from the moonlight.

I was so scared I couldn't even react so I went to look out a window on the other side of the house and saw these people surrounded the house I was in.

I didn't know what to do, i was terrified and then it got even more scary when I saw these people with the masks in the trees too making sure I couldn't escape.

The creepiest part is that I couldn't see their body's only their masks and nothing more.

As I thought about what to do I remember I had seen the mask they wear before. At the diner the creepy man that gave me a bad feeling had the mask layed down next to him.

It all made sense now, the bathroom, the diner and now.

I was being stalked by a cult, the cult knew I couldn't do anything as I was surrounded, all I could do was wait either for help or death.

At 6am as the light from the sun slowly appeared in the sky as they made their move and came towards the house I was hiding in.

Little did they know they made a mistake, they forgot about their last victim, a dead cult member.

I found this cult member dead in the basement, I don't know why they killed their own cult member but I figured he was a spy for another cult or betrayed the cult he was in, but the forgot to remove his uniform.

I took his uniform off his lifeless body and put it on myself so I could now blend in with the cult outside.

The only problem now is how to leave the house and that I figured out too.

After watching the cult I saw they move around every few minutes which shifts their focus of the house where I was currently hiding.

I waited to climb out the basement window and watched for them to move so I could leave and eventually they did move and I took my chance and I succeeded in escaping.

I didn't know where I was going when I escaped but I was going far from this cult, far from this house.

Eventually I got to a road and found help and they took me to a police station.

I just left around 10 minutes ago and currently I am sat on a bench outside the police station where I am telling you this story using the free WiFi.

I need to warn you all to never hitchhike because even though I escaped, I fear one day they will be back for me.

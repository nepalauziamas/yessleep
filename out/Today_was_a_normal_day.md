Today was a normal day. I woke up for class, got dressed, brushed my teeth and forgot breakfast. I barely made it to class on time but I made it. 

For context, I am a 19 year old girl who goes to a community college. I was raised by a single mother. She was a normal mother. She had no issues, other than having to work all the time and leaving me with a sitter. 

Today was a normal day. 

I sat down in my PSY102 class. Wiping sweat from my forehead, as it was still hot outside, and the trek from the parking lot to class was rough. The class started as usual, the teacher went on with his lecture and I took notes. I typically droned out the other students who couldn’t care less about what they were hearing. I looked up at the clock and saw it was 8:53. I was mentally preparing myself to go to my next class when my eyes landed on a student glaring over their shoulder at me. 

I straightened myself out and looked back at them intensely, hoping it would be intimidating enough to get them to back off, but it didn’t work. They continued to state back at me with their brown eyes. As I continued to look at his features I was horrified, he had a grotesquely dislocated jaw, blood pooling down his chin. A huge gash above his right brow. I suddenly felt a pang of dizziness. I grabbed onto the table as subtly as I could without causing a scene. The entire world felt different, It almost didn’t feel real. I looked back into the direction of the brown eyes boy and saw him try to speak, it was more of watching his jaw flop up and down, but didn’t hear the words. I was about to throw up from the spinning of my vision until I heard the professor clap his hands together, stating that class was over, My world went back to normal. I looked up to the direction of the boy and noticed he wasn’t there anymore. I grabbed my books and quickly got up rushing out. 

I walked down the corridors, feeling the warm fall air hit my face. The set up of the classes were an outside system. The “hallways” weren’t really hallways, they were different buildings connecting together. I felt my book slipping out of my grasp and I managed to get it back into place. During this minor struggle, I looked up just in time to see a girl staring at me. Normally, this wouldn’t bother me too much, but seeing this girl in a cheerleading uniform from my high-school was enough to earn a glance from me. Seeing her in the attire, drenched in blood, was more than enough to snap my head in her direction. Her face looked deformed, smashed even. It looked like she had blonde hair before whatever horrific accident caused her injuries. Her hair was partially stained orange from the tinge of blood that was on what I assumed used to be her face. I screwed my eyes shut. 

What is happening to me? Why am I seeing these horrific things?  I took a few breaths and opened my eyes. She was never there. I shook my head, as if shaking it could wring these awful visions from my head. 

I continue the rest of the morning without incident. I connect with other girls in my class, and even have partners for the upcoming projects we have. I had no issues until my biology class. I happened to have a class with my new friend Naomi. (We are also partners in our previous classes, for some reason, I can’t remember which one) we sat beside each other and got our note books out, ready to take whatever notes the professor had for us that day. 

Suddenly, I hit a wall of disassociation much like my first class. The world looked like a movie fish bowl lens with a poorly trained director. I suddenly saw the first boy with the messed up jaw looking back at me again, I saw the bloody cheerleader standing behind the professor who was now talking in slow motion, but the most notably shocking image I saw was a body sprawled out on a table in-front of a boy and girl. Both sitting there taking notes as if this random person wasn’t laying there right under their noses. 

The boy was covered in blood, much like the others. His face was horribly deformed and his appendages were twisted in a sickening way. In his current condition, he should’ve been dead. It’s like the world was in slow motion, all except for me. I walked up to his broken form like a baby deer. I saw his eyes snap towards me, he took a shuttering breathe as he tried to speak. “Y-you.. need… to wake.. up.” 

I felt even more dazed, if that’s even possible. My world spun and I gripped onto one of the tables fruitlessly, I fell to the ground. God knows how much time passes before I awoke. My head hurt so bad I felt like it was split down the middle. I swallowed and tasted a familiar metallic taste, blood. I sat up, I was in an unfamiliar position, I was sitting in a car. My vision was incredibly distorted as I looked out the front window and saw headlights staring into the darkness past the familiar oak of a tree that stood tall. My hands on the wheel, one obviously broken, I reach down to get an idea of my surroundings. I also slowly turn my head towards where the passenger seat would be and see the girl I saw earlier. The same girl in the corridors, covered in blood, but she wasn’t in a cheer uniform, she was in a silk blue dress, but the blood that stained her body matched what I saw earlier, she was dead. 

My breath caught in my throat as I turned to look in the back seat. I saw the brown eyed boy who stared back at me in my psych class his head rested against the frame of the rear passenger door, eyes wide open. His jaw slack from the disconnection from his upper teeth. It was clear he was dead as well. I didn’t even want to see what body lay behind my drivers seat, so I turn forward shutting my eyes and taking a shaky breath. I was hurt badly as well. 

Then, it all came back. I was never in college, I hadn’t even applied yet. I was in my senior year of highschool. The two bodies I saw were my best friend Amelia, and in the back was her boyfriend Lucas. Then I remembered my boyfriend Thomas. I begrudgingly turned my head towards the back, behind the drivers seat. Nothing. There was no one behind me. I felt a rush of relief. I took a breath and stared forward, I then let out a shriek of anguish. There, on the hood, was Thomas. Face horribly mangled, arms and legs poking out in all kinds of directions, and a hole in the windshield indicating how he got on the hood in the first place. I didn’t see him at first due to my vision being so distorted.

Today was a normal day

Until I lost my best friends and boyfriend that fateful prom night in 1988

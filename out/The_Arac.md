I need you guys to accustom yourselves to the things I deal with daily. I am, was, I don’t know, a senior researcher at this organisation for so long, but I can feel the change coming. There’s something happening here and I can’t quite put my finger on what, but I know there’s something about to happen.

Something bad.

So as previously stated, you can call me Whistleblower.

I’m going to release as many files as I can to the public until either I get caught, or I find out what’s going on.

It started with that kid from that town (I can’t put his name or the town’s because they’re always searching the internet for keywords) releasing his encounter with the Darwin; he called it The Gangly Man.

But there’s so much more than that creature, and you all need to know about them.

Watch out for each other out there. 

Subject #2283

Name: Arac

Assessment: Low Level Threat

Not much is known about Arac at the moment, as only one has ever been witnessed and captured at this time. If left in the wild, this creature has potential to become a High Level Threat, but thanks to organisation personnelle, we have managed to detain it before any real damage could be done.  What the Arac fails to have in defensive capabilities, it makes up for in offensive abilities, as it was easy to lure in to containment, only after losing ten of our agents in the process. 

If there are other Aracs out in the wild, we believe that they do not pose a major threat to populations as we can capture them or destroy them faster than they can cause any form of serious damage.

Organisation specialists work nonstop, searching the internet for any plausible evidence of Arac sightings. Once confirmed, a team will be sent to the location to assess if the sighting of the Arac is real. They will then act accordingly to their assessment.

Description:

The Arac is a creature whose description will never do it justice. It is the size of a small dog, like a corgi or something of that stature. It contains the body of a spider, but where its face should be, there is a parasitic worm-like creature protruding. Although it has an arachnid body, we have not witnessed this creature to be fast moving. It’s as if the spider existed before the parasite, and is now left in a catatonic, zombie-like state. This doesn’t explain the size of the creature however.

The parasite is translucent, with its organs and veins easily viewed by the observer. From what we have gathered, it has a tube like orifice inside of it that is it’s mouth, as we can see it sticking into the area of the spider that it has attached itself to. Sometimes, we can see it sucking something from inside the spider, and other times we can see it pulsing something into it.

As the parasite has no eyes and from what have gathered, no ears either, we’ve assessed it to be totally blind and deaf, only moving on extrasensory capabilities.

Abilities:

The first thing we discovered about the Arac is the fact that it does not need to hear or see. The creature uses its spider legs to tap onto the ground with force, and feels the vibrations of things around it in a ten metre radius. It tends to move slowly, tapping the ground and then taking a minimum amount of steps before tapping again.

The Arac also seems to be able to give off a certain pheromone that lures in prey, which are usually farm animals of any size, from dogs to horses to cows, but sometimes even humans if they approach too close to the creature.

When the prey animal has caught the scent of the Arac’s pheromones, they will cease anything they were doing and walk towards it. When close enough to its target, the parasite removes itself from its host's body and will crawl on the ground towards its meal. It will then attach itself to the creature and slowly dig inside of it with its tube-like mouth. Depending on the size of the creature, the parasite could be within it for a twenty four hour cycle, until it has consumed its innards.

Finally, it will crawl out of the husk and find its way back to the spider’s body, which will be tapping consistently throughout the process. 

Upon finding the Arac that we have in captivity, agents witnessed it inside of a farmer's wife, slowly making its way out of her stomach to return to its host. Seven agents were close to the creature, watching the process with live footage being streamed back to the organisation.

When the parasite returned to its host, they didn’t move; we realised in this moment that as a defensive measure, the spider body continues to release the pheromone while the parasite eats, and our agents were all trapped by the smell of it.

The creature turned and disposed of them all accordingly.

A transcription of the even will be attached to the bottom of the file.

Weaknesses:

The Arac has numerous weaknesses. Gunfire, open flame, physical damage, and starvation all seem to affect the creature. It was a quick recovery speed (healing from a gunshot to one of its legs in four hours) so agents who are to approach one are trained to kill it before getting too close.

The \[REDACTED\] Farm Incident

* Date: REDACTED 
* Location: The \[REDACTED\] Farm, \[REDACTED\]

\[Seven Agents arrived on the scene after our internet team found postings about a spider-like creature eating the farmer’s livestock. Upon approach, their live feeds gathered the sight of four dead cows, countless dead chickens and four dead horses. Pigs were roaming freely, eating grass and whatever meat was left on the animals husks. Upon entering the farm house, agents firstly noted the sound of the Aracs tapping, and approached the area.\]

Agent 1: Jesus fuck, this house smells like an outhouse.

Agent 2: Honestly an outhouse would smell better than this.

Agent 3: Stay sharp, I fuckin’ *hate* spiders.

\[Upon entering the kitchen, the agents all stopped at the sight of the farmer’s wife, Miss REDACTED, laying on the floor on her back, a pool of blood surrounding her. The spider was on the table, tapping the wood over and over. When we asked the agents to describe what they were seeing for audio transcription, they did not respond. Slowly, the parasite removed itself from Miss REDACTED, and made its way to the agents, tearing into them one after the other. A second team was dispatched after proper assessment of the Arac; they were given full scent protection, wearing organisation made gas masks. Upon arrival, the Arac was making its way down the driveway of the house. One agent stepped out of the vehicle. When close enough, the parasite detached itself from the host once more, but since our agent was unaffected, she was able to grab the host body and place it in our containment case. Two other agents did the same to the parasite, keeping it from its host's body until returned to the lab for inspection.\]

I haven’t been able to find any story about the Arac online, I’m assuming the organisation has already scrubbed its existence off of the internet, so releasing this file is really putting my neck out there, but it has to be done.

I keep finding these restricted access files on the higher ups computers titled “Omega Protocol”, and I’ve been around the sun enough times to know something with that kind of a name isn’t good.

I took this job because I believed we were good. I believed we were bettering the world and keeping it safe from these monstrosities.

Now, I’m afraid. I fear we’re going to be the destruction of our people.

I recently broke up with my girlfriend and needed to find a place to stay because I had been living with her. I ended up finding a furnished apartment to stay in and the rent was pretty cheap. When talking to the landlord he seemed to be pretty excited about it which seemed a little strange but I brushed it off.

When I finally started moving into the place one of my neighbors came up to me. I thought he was gonna introduce himself but he just said "I'd advise you to leave now before it's too late" I was confused but he left before I could ask what he meant by that.

He looked to be around 6 feet tall and was bald and did look a little chubby but not too much. I didn't think much and went into my new place and the moment I stepped foot in it a shiver down my spine like I wasn't supposed to be there. I don't know why but it felt like I was being watched, I decided to ignore it and think nothing of it.

2 days went by with me living there and the feeling of being watched never went away. I invited over one of my friends and asked them if they felt it but they said they didn't. I thought of leaving but where else would I go. I decided to man up and get over it, but what happened next I wasn't ready for.

That night I was getting ready to go to bed I turned off the lights and get in bed, and was about to fall asleep until I heard a whisper "Hey" my eyes shot wide open, and I looked over at the direction that the sound came from and what I saw terrified me. It was a person or what was supposed to be a person but all I saw was their shadow standing there. It didn't have eyes but I knew it was looking right at me.

I then heard more whispers around me and when I looked around more of them started to appear. My heart was beating faster and faster by the second and the whispers wouldn't stop so I put my head under my pillow and tried to cover my ears.

I eventually fell asleep, I woke up and looked around, and no shadow person in site. I told myself it was just a dream and none of it was real. I got up and got ready for work but when I grabbed my toothbrush I noticed the toothpaste was missing. I looked around and found it behind the toilet I was confused about how it got there it grabbed it and brushed my teeth.

I left to go to my job and in the hallway, I saw my neighbor who told me to leave I just waived to him but he looked at me with a concerned face and walked away. I was confused but just went on with my day. When I got back from work I unlocked my door and the moment I stepped in I was shocked my place was trashed.

There was garbage everywhere papers were thrown around and my trash can spilled over. Did someone break-in while I was gone I cleaned up the place and saw that nothing was stolen. So at this point, I was confused and went to the landlord and told him about it and all he said was that he would look into it.

That night I tried to sleep but was too scared with everything that was going on. But everything seemed normal that night so I was able to sleep. I woke up in the middle of the night to cry I looked around and saw no one at first so I had to adjust my eyes and saw a dark figure of a woman in the corner.

I got up and was going to get closer "Who are you" the crying stopped. The woman then screamed I got scared then ended up passing out. I woke up on the floor I started to remember last night with the woman and when I went to get up I felt a sharp pain.

I lifted my shirt and saw a giant scratch mark across my chest I didn't know how it got there but it hurt like a mother fucker. I had to be going crazy but how would that explain the mark. When I went to get in the shower I smelled something weird as if something was rotting in there, I couldn't stand it and got the hell out of there. 

Days went by like this with the whispers, the shadow people appearing, and things randomly moving around plus that rotting in the bathroom wouldn't go away. It was driving me mad and I didn't know what to do. One night I woke up in the middle of the night because I had to go pee but was too terrified of the shadow people I was seeing.

I told myself it would be quick and ran to the bathroom but when I opened the door I wanted to scream. I saw a man laying there with his throat slit open I tried to help him and the voices started whispering. "Kill yourself" they kept repeating it I looked over and the man was gone I was confused but got the hell out.

I ran to my neighbor's door and slammed on it begging him to open he eventually did and he seemed confused. I told him everything and even started crying. He paused then said, "Long time ago I man used to live there he reported hearing things and seeing people and after a while, he went mad and killed himself in the bathroom".

I was shocked to hear this he then went on " Now whenever someone moves in they report hearing things and seeing people. And something rotting in the bathroom" I was confused by this "Does anyone know why this happens?" He shook his head no and told me that I should get out of there. That night I slept in my car and plan to till I find a new place because I refuse to go back in there.

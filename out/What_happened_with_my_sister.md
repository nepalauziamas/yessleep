This is gonna be long. So bear with me. It happened 4 years ago. I failed to find any scientific explanation for this so I just dismissed it.

That year, my cousin and I had a huge fight with my older sister. And we gave her the silent treatment for w couple of months. During that time, I think my sister got involved in something really dark. She would come home very late. She was always mute which wasnt her nature.

One day, i had a friend and my cousin over. We were watching a movie when I felt a burning sensation on my arm. It was so sudden and out of nowhere. I freaked out so badly bc the feeling was like having fire touch your skin. I ran to the bathroom to run water over it & when I took a good look at it, I found a perfectly written “A” on my arm. It was scratches and had some blood coming out of it but it was a perfect A. I was so scared but they tried to calm me down by saying I must have scratched myself & the scratches turned like that.

I went back to the couch, not less than 20 minutes later, the burning sensation came back in the same arm & I ran to the bathroom again to find the letter “R” scratched below A.  We were all suddenly screaming and running to read some Quran even tho none of us has touched it in years. I was sure I was not scratching myself but at the same time found on google that there was a condition that causes random scratches but it didnt explain the letters. But I bought into it.

Fast forward a month, my cousin and I went on a trip to the beach. We booked a place that was in some cheap resort bc we were broke. We found it by a coincidence and we had never heard of it but its ad popped suddenly up our feed. Everything about that place was an instant turn off. The entire resort was empty. Only two men who work there. They spoke like robots. Like they were waiting for us. Like we were dragged into that & they were expecting something. We dismissed it as we were only renting the place for sleep but would be hanging elsewhere with friends. 

That night, as I was showering, I heard my cousin screaming. I ran out in my towel and once I opened the door I found a man wearing all black sitting on the couch. It took a second and that man disappeared. I looked at my cousin & she was holding her arm saying she had a burning sensation on her back. I looked and to my surprise, the letter “Y” was perfectly crafted at her scapula. I was terrified. Who was that man? What was it with the letters?! We tried to calm down bc we were going out & tried to dress up and leave asap. 

While getting ready, the door to my room that I made sure was always locked bc I hate mosquitos, started to open. We saw the old door handle moving like someone was pushing it down. We didnt hesitate, and ran out the apartment as fast as we could. We saw one of the weird men and he just looked at us smirking and disappeared as fast as we spotted him.

We took an Uber bus to our friends and when I entered, I saw the same man again behind us. To my utter shock, I found my cousin trembling snd asking me to check if there was really a man wearing black behind us or she was “imagining” him. I told her I saw him too, twice. We looked back, the seat was empty.

When we arrived back home from the trip, we found the other creepy man calling us saying he found the TV & mirror broken and that we need to come back. We told him it wasnt us and hung up. 

Two weeks later, I was looking for my charger in the room I shared with my sister. She was asleep. It was on her bed, I slowly approached it as to not wake her up, when suddenly..she entered the room. I looked down on her bed and she wasnt there! I ran out and made myself believe I mistook the blanket for her.

What I couldnt ignore, what happened after a couple of weeks. It was the last straw.
I was not allowed to watch movies while she was sleeping. So I was watching a movie in the living room. It was around 4am, it was still dark. I had no lights on bc i love staying in darkness. She came out her room, she told me she wanted to sleep here so I should watch the movie somewhere else. I didnt want to move all the way to my room so I just entered the kitchen. 

20 minutes later, the movie ended. I opened the door with my flash on bc I forgot my phone in the living room. I didnt want to wake her up while looking for it, and even then she was unappreciative and blurted out a loud angry “hummmphh!“. So I pointed the light towards her to annoy her and found her facing the wall. I stormed back to my room. As I opened the door, I found my sister peacefully sleeping on her bed. I dropped my laptop and started screaming waking my mother up. I never cried that hard before and till now I dont know what came over me.

The next morning, I was 100% convinced my sister was possessed. After thinking, we realised the letters scratched over us where her nickname but not in sequence. Everything pointed to her. I told my mum that she made an angry spell on my cousin and I bc she was mad at us. She didnt believe me and stopped talking to me. I did not sleep in the same room for a month. One day, we all reconciled because of a family emergency. Everything was back to normal. Nothing creepy happened.

I confessed to my sister later on what happened and what we thought. She said mum told her and it upset her we would think of that. She did mention she went to a “fortune teller” who told her there were two women in her life who entered her house, yet carried nothing but disdain towards her & she never thought it was us.
My sister may have a lot of people she calls “friends” who dislike her tho, so maybe there were two of them who cursed her and it harmed us on the way? I can never know. 

What I knew two years later from my mum’s nurse, that “YAR” is a name of a very nasty Jinn who can only show up by black magic and that is why my sister’s name is deemed “haram” by many islamic scholars bc it is similar to this name. (She also told me to not keep saying his name)

So maybe whoever did black magic on my sister, ended up with a Jinn who liked her bc she shared a similar name & seeked revenge from us bc we were not talking to her?
This remains a mystery to me till this day. When I told my friends they believed me and were so scared bc they knew I never believed in this shit & always look for the science behind it so would never make it up. So the only good scientific explanation I found is: my cousin & I both have schizophrenia. Which is still as scary as YAR.

Talia fell asleep first, lying on my cot with her back to us. She lay above the deer skin and remained in her yellow firefighter’s uniform. I lifted the helmet Talia had used against the beast from beside the cot and tried it on my head. It would not go on. I put it back.

Fingleton and I propped ourselves on the floor and cradled our rifles.

“Do you think we did any damage when we shot it?” Fingleton said.

“I don’t know. It squealed when we hit it, but it never went down and took Elliott anyway.”

“He didn’t deserve to go like that.”

“None of them did.”

“When I heard the racket when we shot it I thought we had it. But I doubt we can kill it with what we have in our hands. So we’re stuck. We’re stuck until the weather clears and the bridge to the south opens and we can convince someone there’s a science fiction villain living in an old mine shaft. And what’s more bring a rocket launcher or a damn nuke because bullets don’t seem to work. By then the whole town might be gone. It will be my head on the chopping block when they search for someone to blame.”

“Don’t beat yourself up.”

“My job is to protect this town. This happened on my watch.”

“How could you have known what we are up against?”

“Rutkowski last summer for one. I saw the burned trees. Something wasn’t right about it. But I sat on it. And when it took the Potter kid we should have got someone up here. We could have beat the weather if we’d acted immediately. We didn’t and now what’s done is done. I promised my kids before I left that I would take care of whatever monster was hiding in the forest. And they believed me. I believed it myself. My wife though, she hugged me like she was never going to see me again. She might be right. I’ve never come up against anything I couldn’t handle. Everyone meets their measure at some stage.”

“We aren’t beaten yet.”

“You saw what it is. You saw what it can do. That thing is a force of nature. It will consume whatever is in its path.”

“So we stop it.”

“How do we do that?”

“I haven’t figured it out yet. But we will. We have to. Otherwise we might as well walk out there in the snow right now and go for a long sleep.”

There was a long block of silence. Fingleton fiddled with his rifle, turning it in his hands.

“Why do you do it? I mean why do you live out here all alone.”

“I couldn’t be in that town anymore.”

“So why not go south?”

“I couldn’t do that either. I didn’t want to leave.”

“It must be a hard life up here.”

“It was hard at first, then I took to it like a bird to the sky. Now when I’m in town it’s like there’s static in my head. The sound of cars and bikes and boats and people talking and electricity wires overhead and towers for your phone. It scrambles my brain. Out here my head is clear. I live off the land and it feels like what I was always meant to do. I’ll never go back now.”

“The people in town tell stories about you. You’re the wild man with the long beard and straggly hair who drinks the blood of bears.”

“People don’t believe that.”

“You would be surprised. My kids are afraid of you. But it’s the stories that scare them.”

We fell silent for a time. The wind buffeted the cabin walls and the wood creaked under the pressure. I had endured storms out here before. The sort that don’t let up and you think might never end. Storms that darkened the daylight hours and left you with nothing to do but ride it out. Sometimes you consider the possibility the storm won’t ever end, that this was the new normal. I felt this now. I looked at the black of the window not confident I’d ever see light again.

“Everyone in town knew about what was going on with Lacey.” Fingleton said, breaking the silence. “Bouncing back between you and George. I convinced myself it was part of the reason he went missing and Potter had his brains blown out. Back when I thought it was you who did it.”

“If I’d wanted to do anything like that I would have done it a long time ago. I wouldn’t have waited until now.”

“It was a terrible thing when Lacey passed.”

“It was. She was too young for it.”

Fingleton looked over at the sleeping Talia, her shoulders rising and falling rhythmically. “She’s got a real sense of responsibility that one.”

“That she does.”

“Is that why you stayed and didn’t go south after Lacey died?”

I gave Fingleton a sideways glance. He gave a half smile and continued.

“She looks like you. George was a yellow bellied fool, and she’s not. The apple either fell a long way from the tree, or it didn’t.”

“Don’t take liberties Chief.”

Talia stirred in her bed.

“Get some sleep.” I said and drained my tea and lay on the floor, using my jacket as a pillow. In the corner of the room Boxer half-slept, his nose twitching from time to time, waiting for the scent of the creature.

I shut my eyes and listened to the wind, adding my ears to Boxer’s nose for any sign of the creature, but fatigue overwhelmed and I was soon asleep and dreaming.  

I was working a night shift in the mine. With a dozen other men I loaded into a trolley and we were thrust into the shaft, the steel wheels grinding against the rails. We switched on the torches atop our helmets and supplemented the lights on the ceiling of the tunnel. Along the way we passed square cages containing yellow canaries, our warning system for an overload of carbon monoxide. We trained our torches on the birds ensuring they were upright on their perches and we moved on leaving the birds and their cages in darkness. 

We reached the end of the shaft and relieved a crew of men covered in soot. They took our seats in the cart and were taken away. Then we went to work, drilling and blasting and hacking our way deeper into the coal seam. Soon we were as dirty as the men we had relieved and were coughing and wiping away sweat with blackened forearms. 

I worked with my pick on the hard, unforgiving rock. With each swing rock pinged and a chunk of black fell out of the wall. Soon I waded knee deep through it unable to move. But I kept swinging and rock kept coming away burying me deeper and deeper. 

I gave a heave with the pick, every muscle working to drive it as hard as I could manage into the rock. The pick stuck and I pulled to work it loose and the wall crumbled and revealed a great open cavern. Inside it burned hot and I turned my face away and held my arm up to protect myself. I tried to back up but my buried legs would not move. From the cavern a plume of black smoke filled the tunnel and turned everything black.

Someone lifted me into the trolley. I raised my head and gasped for air. We flew down the tunnel as fast as the trolleys would go. The black smoke followed us threatening at each moment to overrun and consume us. My light caught a cage and the canary lay at the bottom on its back, stiff and unmoving. 

We made it to the light and the open air and I was lifted by an unseen force out of the trolley and up into the sky. Black smoke spewed out of the mouth of the mine and from the brick smokestack to the side. Yellow corpses of canaries littered the side of the mountain and must have numbered in the thousands. The black jet of smoke spread and covered the mine site and all its buildings. It moved on to the forest and consumed the green of the trees and soon the entire landscape was dark and black and dead.

I was on the frozen lake sitting on a small stool. Before me was a small hole cut in the ice and the line from a fishing rod disappeared below the surface. The line jumped and I reeled in the rod and pulled up a trout and hugged it to my chest, but the fish did not kick. I dropped it to the ice and it lay dead, its open eye blackened. The sky above turned from white to grey and then to black and the ice at my feet cracked and spread in all directions like a spider’s web. The ice gave way and I fell into the water and darkness.

Then, as I woke, the darkness dissipated, replaced by the inside of the cabin. It was light and there was no noise. During the night the storm had abated and the wind and the snow had stopped. Boxer sniffed at the bottom of the door and whined.

Talia stood at the window, her face illuminated by the light. Her skin was pale and the uniform she wore shone yellow. She looked out, her eyes wide and she did not move. I kicked Fingleton and he awoke with a start. 

“What’s going on?” Fingleton said.

I went to the window. I stood behind Talia and looked out. The fresh snow shone a bright white under a clear blue sky. Something was moving. The black mass of the creature strode through the trees and into the clearing. It stood and turned its body to face the cabin. At its feet the snow melted sending a plume of water vapour into the sky. 

“Chief you’d better get over here,” I said.

“What do we do?” Talia said.

“Wait and see what it does.”

The creature did not stand for long. It left the cover of the forest and made directly for the cabin. 

“Get away from the window,” I said and pulled Talia to the side. Fingleton had come to the window and I pushed him into the corner. Boxer turned in a circle by the door and barked.

“Quiet,” I said.

The light from the window dimmed and the cabin darkened. The tail of the creature skirted across the window, the tentacles at the end writhed and spewed out black smoke. The black tail raised itself and scratched on the timber above our heads. A chunk of snow loosened from the roof and fell to the ground with a thud. The vertical flue extracting smoke from the stove rattled and distorted.

“It’s trying to find a way in,” Fingleton said.

“It’s only a matter of time until it succeeds,” I said. “This isn’t Fort Knox.”

“We can’t just wait here to die,” Fingleton said.

“We need to get it away from the cabin,” I said. “One of us has to go and the creature will follow.”

“Go where?” Fingleton said.

“To the lake,” I said, “This thing is hot. It lives in fire. Maybe it’s cold that can kill it. We get it out onto the lake. If we’re lucky it melts through the ice and falls into the water.”

“It’s suicide,” Fingleton said. “Even if you make it to the trees, once the tail of the creature finds you and wraps itself around your head you’ll be under its spell.”

“It can be done,” I said. “It is downhill to the lake and you don’t stop and you don’t look back. Maybe it can be done. And then at the lake you coax it out onto the ice. Maybe.”

I trailed off and shook my head. The flue shook again and one of the timber slats framing the penetration in the roof split and a hole opened up. Cold air pushed into the cabin and the flue, now free of its shackle, swung wildly and bounced around the gash in the roof. 

Fingleton’s eyes darted around the room and he raised his hands to the wall of the cabin, which shook and groaned against the force from the creature. 

I grabbed at my boots and shoved my feet into them and grabbed my rifle. I wasn’t about to wait around for a volunteer. There was no time. I would lead the creature to the lake or die trying.

Talia stood and took her firefighter’s helmet from the cot and clasped it on her head. 

“I’ll go,” she said. “The smoke from the creature cannot get through my helmet.”

I opened my mouth to protest and then the yellow of the firefighter’s uniform flashed before me and Talia turned the lock on the door and turned the handle and swung open the door and was gone.

“Stop her!” Fingleton said. He lunged at the door but I closed it on him and grabbed his arm. 

“Wait.”

“What are we waiting for? The creature is out there.”

Heavy footsteps from the creature sounded outside the door. It was moving back around to the front of the cabin. The flue and the cabin stopped shaking. Light returned to the window. 

The creature moved toward the forest in pursuit of the small girl in the yellow uniform. Talia scampered downhill and disappeared into the forest. The creature followed leaving a wake of rising water vapour from its hot skin. 

“She won’t make it,” Fingleton said. “It will get her.”

I released Fingleton’s arm and opened the door. Boxer ran out. I whistled at him and he stopped and waited in the snow.

“Grab your rifle and let’s go,” I said.

I squinted at the low hanging sun. The wind had died and the snow had stopped. The storm had passed. It was cold. I stepped into the thick layer of fresh snow and watched the creature disappear into the forest. The creature had blackened the cabin where it stood. 

I lifted my knees high to negotiate the thick layer of snow and stepped into the melted path left by the creature. I set off at a run with Boxer at my heels and Fingleton in close pursuit.

The black back of the creature flitted in and out of view between the trees. It moved fast. Faster than we were moving. Fingleton was right. Talia would never make it. I cursed myself for not grabbing the girls arm. I should have known she would do it.

Ahead the creature slowed to a crawl, stalking through the trees like a lion in reeds readying to ambush an unsuspecting gazelle. The tail thrust out into the air and wound its way through the treetops. At the tip the tentacles pulsed in anticipation of wrapping around its prey.

Talia scampered down the slope and hurdled a fallen log. Her trailing foot caught a stray branch stub and she tumbled into the snow and out of view. As fast as she fell, she raised herself, brushing snow off her shoulders. The tail closed in and Talia turned and immediately set off once more at a run. The grotesque tail whipped forward, the tentacles at the tip fanned out and pointed at the escaping Talia. It would soon have her.

I raised my rifle and shot at the creature. Fingleton fell in beside me and together we pelted the creature. It let out a high pitched screech and snapped its head in our direction. Red eyes flashed and its burning insides glowed from its open mouth. The black tail flicked around like a cracking whip. The creature hissed, ejecting a plume of black smoke. Boxer snarled and barked and the creature replied in turn with a screech that lowered Boxer’s ears.

“What do we do now?” Fingleton said.

“You circle around that way, I’ll go this way. Head to the lake. One way or another we need to get this thing out on the ice.”

We broke, Fingleton ran left and I ran right with Boxer in tow. The snow on the ground was thinner in the forest, but it was still heavy going. The creature paused, watching us rounding it and soon we were downhill and ahead of it. I reached the log Talia had tripped on moments earlier and I skidded over it and lost my footing on the low side. I tumbled into the snow as Talia had and I picked myself up and continued. 

The creature started again downhill and toward the lake. It took a direct path on the heels of Talia, tail flicking from side to side, first coming at me and then at Fingleton on the other side. The tentacles rippled in the cold air emitting wisps of smoke. 

We were almost at the tree edge and I dove behind a tree. I rolled my back around the trunk and looked for Fingleton. I waved my hand at him and caught his attention and made downwards motions with an open palm. He crouched and pushed his body against a tree out of sight of the creature. I looked out to the lake. Talia was already beyond the tree line and running out into the open.

The black beast lumbered deliberately down the slope. It turned its head from side to side and stopped just short of the tree line. It waited and watched and listened.

“Go out on the ice you bastard,” I whispered.

The creature stood unmoved. The torso of the beast rose and fell with each breath, sucking in fresh mountain air and expelling a twisted mass of grey-black that left dark splotches on the trees as it filtered upward. Small offshoots from the trees that might one day become branches crackled under the heat of the creature. 

Talia was now in the centre of the lake, a small yellow figure alone on the expanse of ice. She stopped and stood. She held out her arms. The creature did not take the bait, or it could not see her. I watched the creature and willed it out on the ice.

“Come and get me. What are you waiting for?”

The voice was loud and clear. It was Talia. She had removed her helmet and she goaded the creature. 

The tail slid from side to side searching for prey. Talia called out once more and the tip of the tail stood at attention. It had heard her. The tail shot vertically through the trees and locked onto the small yellow girl in the middle of the frozen lake. It moved toward her above the treetops. The body followed slowly behind.

Talia stared down the tail coming for her. “Put your helmet on,” I whispered. Talia took her helmet and clipped it down onto the suit as If she had heard me. But she didn’t need me to tell her. The tail had almost reached her when it stopped with a jolt. It had gone as far as it could and was just short of its prey. 

The creature crept forward, coming closer to the bank and the edge of solid land. Its feet burned through the snow. It must break the ice if only it would step onto the lake. It reached the lake edge and stopped. Out on the lake the tail had reached Talia. She stared it down.

“Walk away a little more,” I said.

Talia did not move. She stood firm. I raised myself from my hiding position and moved in behind the beast. Fingleton did the same. We raised our rifles and trained them on the creature, willing it to take one more step. 

“Should we shoot?” Fingleton whispered.

I looked out onto the ice. The tip of the tail was gone. It had not wrapped itself around Talia’s head like it had the others. It looked almost as if it had wrapped itself around her leg. 

“What is it doing?”

I turned back to the forest, back to the log both Talia and I had tripped over. My heart sank. Hanging off a branch was a strip of yellow. Her suit had ripped and she hadn’t realised. The tail of the creature had found the opening.

“Chief,” I whispered, “It has her. I have to go. You shoot it and push it out onto the ice. Keep Boxer here.”

I led Boxer to Fingleton’s heel and I sprinted through the trees, making a path around the creature. I broke the tree line and I turned to the creature, which remained on the edge of the lake. I heard the first shots from behind and Boxer barking manically. 

Talia walked toward me, her helmet now off. She pulled the yellow jumpsuit off her shoulders. The tail twisted around her leg and up behind her back and the tentacles at the tail tip wrapped around her head.

I ran to close the gap and Talia raised her rifle and pointed it at me. I dived into the layer of snow atop the lake and a shot rang out and I heard it whistle past my ear. I stumbled to my feet and ran with my head lowered and Talia fired again and this one caught me in the shoulder. A searing hot pain exploded where the bullet buried itself into my body but I kept running. Talia was preparing a third shot when I reached her. I leapt at her and tackled her to the ground, the rifle spilling from her hands. I pinned her and she gave me an elbow to the stomach and broke free. Fingleton fired another series of shots from the woods and Boxer’s frenzied barking filled the air.

I turned a glance back and the creature wailed in pain as Fingleton hit it from behind. Talia, her head covered in the pulsing tentacles, scrambled to the rifle and I lunged at her and took her left arm behind her back. I let my weight fall on her and it knocked the rifle clear. I got between her and the rifle and picked it up and threw it as far as I could. Talia grabbed my leg and tried to upend me, but her boot slipped and she fell face first on the ice. 

I heard another burst of shots from the woods and the creature let out a piercing high pitched scream. The tail unfurled and retreated.

Talia went limp. I took her by the arms and started dragging her away from the woods and the creature and out further onto the ice.

“If you want us, you need to come and get us,” I said.

The tail hovered above the ice, black smoke spilling out of the tips as if under pressure. It came for us. 

Fingleton was now visible having come through the trees behind the creature. The tail almost had us, it writhed and spat smoke in Talia’s face. I heard a crack. It was the ice. The creature had come forward and was on the lake. I needed it to fall through. I needed it to fall through before it got to us. 

I scrambled backward. The gap between us and the tail of the creature was closing, but the sound of cracking ice grew louder and louder. The tentacles came so close to my face I had the instinct to swat it away like a fly. It was so close I could feel the heat and smell the acrid smoke. 

And then in an instant it fell through. The black creature slipped from sight below the surface of the lake and the black tail retracted and disappeared into the lake like a strand of spaghetti sucked into a mouth.

Flash boiled water beneath the layer of ice expanded and, with nowhere else to go, broke up through the ice in a mushroom cloud of steam and shattered ice. Ahead of me Talia rode up on the wave and I lost her from view as the ice below my feet cracked and lifted. A veneer of warm water enveloped my body followed almost immediately with cold. Water filled my nose and ears as I was tossed and churned. And as quickly as it had come, the water calmed and I kicked to the surface.

I searched frantically for Talia. I could not see her. There was a puff of black smoke just above the surface and it was Talia exhaling the last of the poison the creature had infected her with. I swam to her. Talia clutched at a piece of floating ice.

“What is happening?” she said.

I wrapped one arm around her and kicked to the water line where Fingleton and Boxer were waiting. Fingleton held out a hand as we reached the shore and helped us back to land. We sat in the snow, wet and freezing. The creature had gouged out an enormous gash in the ice layer. Some vapor from the warmer water lingered in the air where the creature had gone in, but the creature was gone.

“You think we killed it?” Fingleton said.

“I think so,” I said.

I turned to Talia. She blinked away water from her eyes. 

“Are you ok?”

She nodded.

When summer came and the rest of the lake melted, I expected to see the corpse of the creature roll up on the shore, but it never did. If it has a corpse it is down at the bottom of the lake. 

Over the following few months I saw Talia from time to time. Sometimes in town, and on a couple of occasions when she trekked up to my cabin. We never spoke of the creature. She wanted to put it behind her and move on. 

She stayed with the wife of Potter and finished school and moved south to go to university. The day she left she came to see me and asked if I had any thoughts of moving south. I told her I didn’t. Canary Hill is my home.

Fingleton is still here, watching over the town. He had the government come in with dynamite and blow the hell out of that old mine shaft. It seemed to work, no one has gone missing in the woods below Canary Hill since. When I see him in town he is always friendly, but I don’t go to town much.

I still share my cabin in the woods with Boxer. The cabin still bears the charred scar from the creature. I thought about replacing the wood, but decided to leave it, it’s a reminder of what happened if nothing else, and sometimes reminders are necessary.

The people in town sometimes talk of the creature. But for those who never saw it, the creature and what it did became like a legend or a fairy tale. No one from the south believes us. They have written the deaths off as a bear and the destruction of the mine was done more to appease Fingleton. 

I don’t know what it was we fought with, I don’t have a name for it, and I don’t know if there are any more out there somewhere. 

After the creature fell into the lake, the ice did not return. Each day until winter was over I would hike down to the lake and watch for ice that never came. I wonder if the ice will ever return. 

A black mass spreading over the land and consuming all in its path still haunts my dreams.

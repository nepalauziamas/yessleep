So I’ve been working on cleaning up the journal and it’s a fucking trip. Those stains on some of the later pages look like they might be blood. Also–I’m not an expert–but it seems like the handwriting changes every now and then. Weird shit. There are two or three sections left that I’m having trouble reading but I’ll post what I have transcribed so far. This is definitely putting me off any “murder mystery” parties. Here's the [first part of the journal if ya missed it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/uqvtri/a_murder_at_foxflight_manor/)

*May 11th, 1995 (cont.), Foxflight Manor*

The seven of us decided to move to one of the studies (the house had three) to discuss our options. Along the way, we tried a few side doors and exterior windows but couldn’t open any of them. It felt like something bigger than just strong looks and unbreakable glass. I got the impression that the house, or something in it, was not going to allow us to leave. Kelly stayed quiet until we were all settled in among the floor-to-ceiling bookshelves.

William discovered a bar set inside of a model globe and appointed himself our bartender. I took a seat on a leather sofa next to Evaline, sipping at my scotch. It tasted expensive and familiar, but distant, like something I hadn’t experienced in years. My memory was still a puzzle with most of the pieces scattered on the floor, but I was slowly remembering. Foxflight Manor, for example, was coming back to me in exceptional detail. I could picture the winding stairs and long halls with their fine rugs and portraits. I closed my eyes and saw the grounds, the gardens, the attic and observatory and the parlors. Then I tried to recall my last name and my thoughts fell through my mind like sand in a sieve.

Peter was the first to break the silence once we were all seated.

“Kelly, when you say you saw a ghost-”

“Ghosts.”

“Okay, *ghosts*. Can you, uh, elaborate?”

Kelly was staring down into her drink, holding the glass with both of her small hands.

“I’ve been seeing them all night. Mostly just shadows, at first. Shadows where they shouldn’t be or that moved against the light. But the longer we’ve been here, the clearer they become. I saw a few out in the foyer just now. They stood by the door and the windows. I think…I think they’re what’s keeping us in the house.”

“Do you see any spirits here now?” Lucas asked.

Kelly looked around at each of us, stopping for a moment to study each of our faces.

“Maybe,” she said, finally. “I’m not sure.”

“How is it that you can see these phantoms while the rest of us can’t?” Roger asked.

Kelly shifted in her seat. “I’m a psychic.”

“Like tarot cards and palm reading?” William asked.

“No, I don’t do any of that. I don’t have a crystal ball or anything, either. I’ve always just had some degree of extrasensory perception.”

Roger snorted.

“I believe her,” Lucas said, glaring at Roger. “What was it Shakespeare said? Something about, ‘there being more things in Heaven and Earth than dreamt of in your philosophy?’”

“Dreamt is a good way to put it,” Roger muttered, getting up to make a new drink.

I glanced at Peter. He was watching all of us quietly. I got the impression he was coming to a decision.

“I believe you, too, Kelly,” Peter said. “And I think it’s past time for all of us to provide a little more information about who we are and why we are here. Going by first names only was fun when we were playing a mysterious game orchestrated by an equally mysterious hostess, but now that’s all over.”

“Are we sure?” Lucas jumped in. “I mean, we came here for a murder mystery dinner party. Maybe…”

Peter shook his head. “I don’t know if you’ve ever seen a dead body before, Lucas. I have. Mary isn’t playing a game with us.”

“Are you volunteering to start, Peter?” Roger asked, ice clinking into his glass. “Who are you?”

“That’s fine. My full name is Peter Bannerfield. I’m a novelist, primarily thrillers and horror.”

“I knew you looked familiar,” Lucas said, grinning.

Peter smiled back. “How about yourself?”

“Lucas Merit. I’m a professor at the University of Maryland. Paranormal Research.”

“Roger Waters. Historian.”

Peter looked at me next and I felt a coil of panic wrap around my ribcage. The black blankness whenever I went looking for a memory was gone. Instead, it was now a crash of too much: too much light and too much noise, moments sprinting by and crashing into each other, going down in a tangle. I took a breath, trying to still the commotion and collision just long enough for me to remember some small details…

I saw myself seated at a long table, talking into a microphone. Then there was a green chalkboard, white powder from the chalk caught like dust motes in sunshine pouring through a window. Foxflight Manor. Looking down at the courtyard. Walking in the woods around the house. A name.

“Bruce Clare,” I said, forcing a smile. “I’m also a professor. Um, philosophy.”

Peter nodded and turned to William. I noticed that Roger was staring at me, an unreadable look on his face as he sipped his scotch.

“Hi folks. I’m William Daver. Architect.”

“Kelly Celinie. Professional psychic.”

We all turned to Evaline, who took her time responding. She waited until her glass was empty and Lucas was beginning to glance around.

“Evaline Van Yorn. I guess you would call me a socialite. In practical terms, that mostly means I enjoy sleeping in, nice dinners, and traveling on the family dime.”

“Van Yorn?” Roger asked. “As in, one of Maryland’s original millionaire families? Owners of, well, a little of everything now, I’m sure.”

Evaline smiled, though only her lips moved. “Guilty as charged.”

“So three academics, an architect, a psychic, and a horror writer,” Peter said. “And a socialite? That’s a bit out of place. May I ask why you think Mary invited you to this event, Evaline?”

“I know exactly why Mary invited me. She always invites me to her odd little parties. I’m her sister.”

There wasn’t a collective gasp so much as a shared silence.

“Mary Van Yorn,” Roger said. “To think that I just had dinner with a pair of heiresses.” He looked at Evaline closely. “I have to say, considering your sister was just murdered, you seem quite calm.”

Evaline smiled again, this time showing a flash of white teeth.

“I promise you, Mr. Waters, that I am calm only in that I know the monster who murdered Mary is in this room with me.” She looked around at all of us. “And I don’t plan on letting them leave Foxflight.”

We sat in the study for the next half hour considering our next steps. Lucas pushed the theory that the house was a spiritual maze and that we could use Kelly’s gift to navigate our way outside. There was…significant skepticism about that plan, not the least of which was from Kelly herself. She wasn’t confident in her ability to see the hidden bones of Foxflight.

“I can just sense energy around us, watching us, waiting, I think,” she said. “I’m not sure why. Most of all, I sense hunger. But I can’t tell where it’s coming from. Maybe everywhere.”

Evaline suggested that we split up and search the entire house for any sign of a way out. Peter thought that was an excellent idea, except instead of splitting up, we should all stay together. We took a group vote and Peter’s variation was the overwhelming winner. It felt a little ridiculous, seven of us moving as a cluster through the dim halls of Foxflight. After wandering through the first floor for several minutes, I noticed we were naturally breaking into smaller clusters. Lucas was peppering Kelly with questions, taking notes in a slim, leather-bound book. Roger, William, and Peter were together towards the front, the unofficial leaders of our expedition.

That left me in the back with Evaline. I kept glancing at her from the side of my eye. She was beautiful; the distant, controlled kind of look that comes from good genetics and a lifetime of care. Nothing about her seemed artificial, but it did all look planned. Evaline caught me staring and gave me a grin, kinder than the ones she’d displayed in the study.

“I’m sorry about your loss,” I said since that felt like the expected thing to say.

“Thank you.”

“How are you holding up?”

Evaline rubbed her arms. “Emotionally? Numb. Physically? Freezing. These halls are Hell for drafts.”

I shrugged off my suit jacket and held it out for her while we walked. Evaline regarded it for a moment and then smiled and slid it on.

“They say chivalry is dead.”

I winked. “I guess I’m old-fashioned.”

“Yes, I see that.”

The group in front of us stopped suddenly.

“Do you see that?” Kelly whispered, pointing up ahead to where the hallway forked, an internal crossroads for the house.

“See what?” Roger asked, squinting.

Peter took a step forward. “What are we looking for, Kelly?”

“I see it,” I said. “Oh God, I see it.”

It didn’t have a fixed shape. The thing at the end of the hall was mostly shadow, though a few lines of light shone through here and there like veins. It was constantly moving, undulating and writhing, at one moment shaped like a man, the next a pack of dogs, then a reaching tree. Kelly turned and locked eyes with me.

*What is it?* I mouthed silently.

*Don’t know*, she replied. *Try not to touch it.*

“We should move along,” Kelly told the group. “I think…I think it would be better if we took the leftward passage, moving single file forward, as close to the wall as you’re able.”

“I still don’t see a damn thing,” Roger muttered.

Peter led the way, pressed almost flat against the wall. As he passed the shadow shape, a piece of it floated over like a jellyfish on the tide. It stopped several feet away and bobbed up and down for a while before drifting back. We moved quickly; when it was my turn to go by the entity, I felt a deep chill, so penetrative and cold I worried the acid might freeze in my stomach. There was a smell to the shadow stuff, too, and not an unpleasant one. I was reminded of burning leaves in the fall, of old paper and cinnamon and dust.

Once we were through the passage, the hall emptied out into a grand ballroom. It was furnished with tall, carved chairs against the walls, large tables arranged for dining, and a massive empty space in the middle for dancing over black and white tiles. A freshly polished grand piano dominated one corner. Floor-to-ceiling silk curtains billowed against an invisible draft. There was a sweeping staircase at the end of the room rising up to the house’s second floor.

Lucas leaned against a marble pillar. “You know, this place seems a bit bigger on the inside than what we saw on the outside.”

“Of course,” replied Evaline. “Isn’t that always the case with houses like this?”

Peter cleared his throat. “Hey folks, I just want to check…you all see the shapes in the curtains, right? I’m not going crazy, am I?”

I looked at the nearest pair of closed curtains. There was something hidden inside the fabric, a lump that had a vaguely human form.

“I see them,” I said.

“Me too,” Kelly said.

“I…I think I might, as well,” Evaline added, reaching towards a curtain but stopping short.

“Same,” said William.

Lucas squinted. “I, uh, okay maybe there’s an outline?”

“Yeah, I don’t know what you all are seeing,” Roger said, advancing on a window. I saw a clear silhouette under the fabric, which disappeared when he swept the curtain back. “See? Empty. We’re all just amped up right now, letting our imaginations run wild.”

Kelly walked towards the piano. Before she reached it, a note rang out, sharp and clear. It was followed by a string of notes that filled the ballroom. Roger was frozen with his hand still on a curtain. I felt my heart begin to go off like a parade in my chest. That panic flavor again wet on my tongue. The urge to scream.

“You heard that, too, right?” I asked.

Roger dropped the curtain. “It could be a player piano.”

Evaline rolled her eyes. “I can personally promise you that Foxflight is haunted. It was one of the major selling points for Mary.”

“Was she an occultist?” Lucas asked.

“In a manner of speaking, I suppose. I filled my empty time with wine and sailing trips and Italian sunsets. Mary invested in spellbooks and haunted houses and the like. I always figured it was her way of trying to connect with our parents. They died when we were both very young.”

“Foxflight was designed as a ghost trap,” William said, running one hand down the back of a beautifully carved chair. He saw that we were all looking at him and continued with a smile. “I did some research into the property before accepting Mary’s invitation for the party. This house has a fascinating history.”

“It surely does,” Roger added, looking directly at me.

I raised my eyebrows, but he frowned and looked back at the piano. Kelly was seated on the bench, her hands hovering over the keys but not touching them.

“There’s someone right next to me,” she said. “I can almost hear them, feel them. They want something.” Kelly looked at us where we stood clustered around a table. “She–I think it’s a she–is mad at one of us. Furious. But I can’t tell who or why.”

“Maybe we can communicate with them?” I suggested.

“What do you recommend?” Evaline asked.

She was still wearing my blazer, though the ballroom was warmer than the hallway. It went well enough with her dress and I was happy enough to see her in it. But she was watching me with an odd look on her face. I couldn’t tell if it was anger or confusion or something else.

“Anyone see a Ouija board?” William asked.

Lucas shook his head. “I’ve got six in my car, but haven’t noticed any in the house. However!” He reached into his jacket and pulled out a small box with a grin. “Never leave home without them.”

He lifted the box so we could all see the tarot design on the front. Kelly walked back over and winced.

“I don’t really do that,” she said. Lucas’ face fell. “Well,” Kelly continued, “I suppose we could try.”

“I’ll clear off a table,” Peter offered but Kelly shook her head.

“Not here. Not in this room. There’s something…wrong here. Off. Nasty. I don’t want to stay here and I really think we should go.” She turned to Evaline. “Do you know if there are any rooms upstairs that-”

“The observatory. I’m not sensitive to, uh, these things, but even I felt something when Mary took me there. The air is thin and cool there, like on a mountain. There’s almost a hum.”

“That should work,” Lucas said, pocketing the deck of cards.

“Let’s hurry,” Kelly said, leading the way towards the staircase.

“Wait.”

We turned to see Roger push the curtains all the way back from the window he was standing beside. He picked up one of the ornate chairs, struggling with the weight, then hurled it at the glass. It bounced off and fell to the floor.

“Yep, we’re still trapped,” he said.

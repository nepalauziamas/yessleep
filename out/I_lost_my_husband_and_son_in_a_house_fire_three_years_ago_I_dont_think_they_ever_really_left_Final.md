Dennis was arrested as he drove to my house. The emergency dispatcher sent out the description of his car and the potential travel routes that I provided. Officers made contact with him three blocks from my house. They found a handgun in the passenger seat of his car.

In addition to his charges of terroristic threatening and DUI, the board of education also pressed charges against him for breaking into the board building. He was terminated immediately and held in county jail. I nervously checked the county detention center website multiple times per day to make sure he hadn’t been released. It surprised me that he hadn’t bailed himself out, but day after day he remained there.

The mystery of his failure to make bail was solved when Dennis’ ex-wife, Samantha, called two weeks after the drunken phone call. Through tears, she told me of her abusive marriage. Dennis had never hit her, but the mental and emotional abuse was immense. She apologized for not reaching out to me sooner to warn me, but I assured her no apology was necessary.

Samantha confided in me that Dennis had a gambling addiction and lived in crippling debt. She had endured years of emotional abuse, but it was the near-poverty state they were living in that finally prompted her to take the children and leave. He was six months behind on child support and the court system had started to garnish his wages.

A sliver of me felt sorry for him. I also felt a little bit of shame that I knew wasn’t fair. His financial situation wouldn’t allow him to afford bail or an attorney. None of it was my fault, but some black tendril of emotional manipulation tried to anchor itself in my brain. Those kinds of thoughts can grow like cancer.

Mental and physical abuse can cause even the strongest person to become numb and hollow. Samantha had survived her ordeal and managed to escape. I was proud of her, though I never told her. While I may not have allowed it to continue, so many people are manipulated into accepting it, or worse, believing they deserve it.

With the assistance of a local domestic violence advocacy group, I was able to receive a protective order against Dennis. A kind advocate walked me through the process and assisted me with the court filing. The process was uncomfortable as our state allows both parties to be present in court to present evidence, but this amazing group was with me every step of the way.

Life returned to the shattered version of normalcy that I had achieved before Dennis entered the picture. The events caused me to withdraw again, but my sister and brother-in-law were a constant source of comfort. They stayed with me for a few weeks. My brother-in-law even slept in a chair beside the front door for the first few nights. A bit overzealous, perhaps, but amazing nonetheless.

After a few weeks, I grew more comfortable and they returned home. It was lonely but also nice to have a bit of space to myself. My sister, ever the worrier, insisted on leaving a handgun for me. I tucked it away in my nightstand, hoping never to use it.

Honestly, I didn’t even feel completely alone. The obsidian carvings of my husband and son kept watch over me day and night. I moved them from room to room with me throughout the day when I was home.

The carvings soothed me but also concerned me. I could never fully come to terms with some of the strange events surrounding them. The car keys. Showing up on the nightstand. Dennis’ broken car window. Mentally, I knew they weren’t moving, but I could not remember moving them on some occasions.

I returned to work three weeks after the night Dennis was arrested. The support of the faculty and students humbled me again. Never let anyone tell you that community isn’t important. The kindness and comfort received from them were invaluable to me.

I finally stopped checking the detention center website religiously.

Dinner time had returned to the unusual format as before. Each evening when I returned home I would cook myself a meal and move the statues to the dinner table to keep me company. I would share the events of the day and the two of them would smile politely as their carved eyes almost seemed to glitter with life as they reflected the overhead light.

In the evenings I would place them on my nightstand. I would say goodnight to them and tell them how much I loved and missed them. In the back of my mind, I always heard them say it as well. It was unsettling but comforting.

\*\*\*\*\*

It was 3:05 AM and I heard something move in my bedroom.

My eyes burst open and struggled to adjust to the darkness. A sensation of being watched flooded my body and the hairs on my arms stood on end. I felt like a gazelle barreling through the savannah, knowing all the while that lions perched in the high grass waiting to pounce.

I brushed my arm to the nightstand and felt shocked when I didn’t make contact with the soapstone statues. In a panic, I turned and pulled the chain on my bedside lamp and blinding illumination flooded the room. A figure stood in front of my bedroom door.

“Hello Emily,” Dennis said, his eyes cold and piercing.

I broke loose from my frozen state and pulled the nightstand drawer out. Pulling too hard, the drawer fell out of place and slammed to the floor. The contents were dumped onto the floor and scattered across the carpet. Terrified, my eyes darted from side to side trying to find the handgun my sister had left me.

It was nowhere to be found. I looked to my nightstand and my cellphone was gone as well. Somehow, I was most startled to see that the carvings of Walter and Aaron were missing.

“Looking for these?” Dennis said with amusement. He dropped my cellphone to the floor and stomped it. The cracking of the screen made me cringe. After destroying the phone, he pulled up the tail bottom of his shirt to reveal the handle of the gun that once rested in my nightstand drawer. “I figured you may have gotten a gun since I was last able to see you. Thank God you’re a heavy sleeper, baby. You could have hurt me before we got to talk!”

“The alarm…” I muttered. “The cops will be here soon…”

“Cut the phone line,” he said without pause. “Should have spent the money for a better system. You can be so silly sometimes. That’s why you need me.” 

Dennis began to step toward me slowly. Still wrapped in the blankets, I began to push myself backward. As I tried to slide my legs out from under the blankets and onto the floor I became tangled and fell from the edge of the bed.

“Emily,” he said with surprise. “Are you okay? Let me help you up!”

He walked around the corner of the bed and stared at me. I pushed myself into the corner in a panic reflex and stared at him, fear swelling. My eyes watered with rage and disgust.

“Dennis,” I whimpered. “Please leave. I have a protective order. You’ll go to jail.”

“Sweetheart,” he said as he stood over me. “I just want to talk. I don’t like how things ended and I just want to try and make it right.”

“No!” I said more forcefully. Dennis smiled in amusement as he looked at me. My eyes were drawn to the outline of the gun under his shirt. I only had to wait for him to get a little closer to me and I would make a move for it.

He ran his hands through his messy hair and sighed.

“Look here,” he said, almost exasperated. “You got me thrown in jail… and I forgive you. We can work this out. You’ve just got to be smart about this. Are you going to throw this away over one bad night?”

“You hurt me, Dennis,” I replied. [“I’m not going to let you hurt me.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/gtripp14/comments/vmwhty/domestic_violence_and_abuse_support_resources/)

The amused smile slid off of his face. A mask of pure rage replaced it. The look of malice and contempt from the night he grabbed me in the kitchen presented itself.

No, this face wasn’t a mask. This was the real Dennis. The mask was the kind and genial man who had wooed me over coffee. The man who melted away my defenses. That man was a lie. This hateful thing before me was Dennis.

“If you think that was me hurting you,” he said in a low tone. “, then you are about to learn a difficult lesson.”

As Dennis began to close the short distance and reach toward me, I prepared myself to fight back. Bracing my feet against the wall, I knew I would only have one shot to take the gun. Just one shot to make it out of this alive.

*Five feet away…*

*Four feet away…*

*Three feet away…*

*Two feet away… This was it…*

As Dennis stood a foot away from me, there was the sound of stampeding footsteps in the hallways. Heavy thuds resounded and shook the room. The reverberation was so intense I could feel it in my bones.

“Who the hell is here?” Dennis said, head snapping toward to door to the hallway. “Tell me who…”

His sentence was cut off and I pushed off against the wall and wrapped my arms around his waist. I pushed him backward with all of my strength and he began to stumble. Feet tangled, Dennis twisted his ankle and began to fall backward, smacking his head against the floor with a sickening thud.

Before pushing myself off of the floor, I pulled the shirt away from the waistband of his pants and pulled the gun from his waist. Switching off the safety, I took a step back and aimed the gun at him as he lay sprawled on the carpet.

It took him a moment to collect himself. By the time he did, he was looking into the barrel of the gun. The rage returned to his face for a moment, but fear danced in his hateful eyes. He held his hands up in a gesture of defeat.

“Get up,” I spat. “Keep your hands in the air and walk five feet in front of me. We’re going to the neighbors to call the cops.”

“And if I don’t?” He asked.

“The first shot goes in your leg,” I replied. “If that doesn’t work, we’ll move on from there. Get moving.”

Dennis wobbly lifted himself back onto his feet and put his hands in the air. He limped clumsily toward the bedroom door. His pace was slow and I made sure to keep a safe distance between us. The ankle may not be as bad as it seemed and I wasn’t taking chances.

Dennis passed through the bedroom door into the hallways, hands still raised. Without warning, the bedroom door slammed shut. His hands were visible above his head and I knew that he couldn’t possibly have moved that quickly.

“What the hell?” I heard him say through the door. Rushing forward, I began to turn the knob but the door wouldn’t budge. No matter how hard I tried to turn it, the handle wouldn’t rotate. “Hey! Hey! Get off of me!”

Dennis began to shriek like a wounded animal. Thrashing and thuds penetrated the door. The floor shook and the sound of something being dragged across the floor filled my ears. Dry cracks echoed in the hall and Dennis’ wails grew louder.

It was the snapping of bones.

“No! Please!” he begged. “I’m sorry! I’ll never bother her again! Just don’t…”

Silence.

I backed away from the door and raised the gun toward it. There was no noise coming from the hallway now. Unnerving silence filled the space where the desperate screams had been only moments earlier. My heart jumped into my throat when I heard the *click* of the light switch from the other side of the door. Bars of illumination filtered in from the space beneath.

The latch clicked and the hinges squealed as the door slowly opened into the bedroom.

Dennis was gone.

Sitting in the center of the hallway were two small stone figures. Even from this distance, I could see the lopsided grin and mischievous smile that I loved and missed so much. Their eyes sparkled, almost alive. Underneath the base of the smaller effigy, there was a scrap of paper.

Venturing carefully into the hallway, gun still leveled, I approached the carvings of my husband and son. I pulled a scrap of paper from below the carving of Aaron. The paper was yellow and crinkled with age and the edges were blackened and flaking.

Tears streamed down my cheek as I read the words.

[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ppfp6z/my_girlfriend_would_answer_one_question_every/)

The week following the events of the campsite may have been the happiest of our entire relationship.

I couldn't really understand how she could accept me, or even love me, after what I had planned to do. Not only planned, but began to do.

"How can you take it?" I had asked her, "How can you accept that I almost killed you, ultimately because I was just missing out on sleep?"

"Because I know that you love me," she said.

I do love her, and I know that the love I felt for her is what kept something much worse from happening that night at the hatch.

I can't explain it, but there had been a fog over me, clouding all of my thoughts. Thinking back over the previous months, I could barely remember any of the time at all. Not just the nights and the questions, but even the days. I had felt such a strong undercurrent of anger and impatience that by the end I was totally consumed, although at the time it felt so rationalized.

What a ridiculous thought that I could have been looking in the face of a miracle each night and have hated it.

Once the fog was lifted, I could only feel how much I loved her, and I knew in reality that it had actually been happening to her, not to me. The effects were there, but I had barely noticed them. She had lost a considerable amount of weight, and she walked at a new pace that somehow had half the life as before. It was like she had been drained.

I found a new anger. Not at her, but at the time stolen from us by whatever this mystery could be. We talked in the first week after how we could just live with it, and move on in peace. Deep down that wasn't what either of us wanted, and the only true way forward for us was to unravel the origins of our situation.

I realize that I never mentioned our names. I don't particularly want to share them, but I can give you some placeholders.

Call her Amelia, and call me Jack.

Following what we can call our vacation time, Amelia and I worked together on a plan alongside a list of goals. We needed structure. First and foremost we just wanted to understand what had been happening, and then if possible, stop it.

Ultimately it felt convenient that the source of trouble could also answer any question we might have, so we took precautions to make sure that we could actually benefit from the information.

We began compiling a list of questions that we would like to have answered. It seems like it would be simple enough to just ask "What is happening?", but I knew from experience how vague some of the answers could be.

I planned to write down the answers every night when answered, but Amelia had the suggestion to record the interactions as well, so we kept a camera charged on a tripod next to the bed. So far, I hadn't gathered any proof that these things had been happening, and she was also curious for herself.

The plan came together, and at the best of times we both would have admitted it was a fun experience to sit on the edge of such a strange phenomena, especially once we were working it together as a couple.

"I'm proud of us," I said one night.

"Yeah me too," she said, "Some scary stuff has happened, but that has to be part of it somehow, right?"

"I want you to know that no matter what happens, I'm here for you," I told her, "I still don't know what happened before, but I'm going to make up for it. Whatever this is, we'll beat it."

"I know," she said, smiling.

It was the first night of what would be the start of our official investigation. The questions I had been asking over the previous week had mostly been placeholders and quick attempts at information and had mostly resulted in nothing useful.

Amelia fell asleep first. There was little chance I could have, given how strangely excited I was for our first question on the list. I practically sat on the bed with the notebook in hand for the next couple hours.

The time came, and Amelia's body stirred. Eyes open, she turned towards me, just as coldly and calculated as she had always done. I didn't wait for a prompt.

"What is your name?" I asked.

I already had the camera running, and I was eager for the response. Never with any other question in the past could I remember such a long pause before the answer. She kept looking at me with a blank expression, almost like she hadn't heard, but I just waited.

Finally she made a sound. It wasn't a word, and it didn't sound like a name. It almost felt like she couldn't really tell me her name, and this was the closest she could get.

The way she said it had the first hint of emotion I had heard from her, and with that smallest sound, she sent me into tears. I don't understand why it had such an effect on me. I think I finally internalized the fact that this truly was another being, and maybe Amelia and I were the victims in this situation along with her.

I can't convey the sound she made, but it was close enough at least that I finally had something to go with.

Call her Grace.

I showed Amelia the footage as soon as she woke up the next day. When Grace gave her name, it had been so quiet that the camera didn't pick it up, but it didn't matter. Amelia was fascinated by the footage, and even just seeing herself move and speak was enough to send her pacing around the room. I wasn't sure if she was angry, or scared, or even excited.

"Grace?" she asked, almost to herself.

"Well, that's not what she said exactly, but that's as close as I can get," I said.

"Do you think if you call her that, you'll get any kind of reaction?"

"I don't know, but I think we're on the right track. She's never showed any emotion like that before. I think she's just as much unwilling here as we are."

The plan would continue, and we were happy to have the first question on the list answered and recorded, but unfortunately the following night was interrupted.

Just before 9:00 pm, a knock came at the door. Neither of us expected anyone, and for the most part had kept to ourselves for the past few months. Instinct kicked in and I asked Amelia to step into the bedroom, maybe even further into the closet.

I went to the door and looked out to see a man about my age, standing a few feet back from the door.

"Who is it?" I called out.

"It's hard to explain actually," he said, "I come in peace."

He had a goofy quality to his voice, but my gut told me to keep the door closed.

"Give it a shot," I said.

"This is going to sound really strange, but I'm actually looking for someone, I've knocked on all the other doors here on the hall, but they don't know her." 

"Who are you looking for?"

"That's the strange part," he said, "I don't actually know her, I just know that I'm supposed to find her. At night I have these crazy dreams. I can't even..."

He trailed off, and for a few seconds seemed lost.

"I just need to find her. I don't know why, I don't really know how, but I at least know that she is close to here. Does any of this ring a bell for you?," he asked.

"I'm sorry, I live here by myself," I said.

"Yeah. Yeah, you might be right," he said, "Except I already talked to the landlord, and know that a woman leases this apartment. So..."

He was closer to the door than he had been at first, and it was extremely subtle, but I placed my hand on the knob and could feel it being tested from the other side. I tried to stay calm.

"Look, there is no one else here, and honestly you're freaking me out, I think it would be best if you left. I can call the police, and maybe they can help you find who you're looking for."

I kept looking out at the man through the peephole, and saw a strange shift go over his face. Almost like one person had been standing there a moment before, and now it was another. You only would have noticed if you had actually watched them switch places.

"You can't protect her forever," he said, in a voice that sounded the same, but didn't.

The shift happened again, and I knew the original man stood there once more. He shook his head a few times and rubbed his eyes.

"Of course," he said, "Look, I'm sorry. I'm going, I don't really know what's happening to me, and I'm sorry. I get it."

He left. I heard the elevator open and close down the hall, but waited awhile by the door just in case. That night, Amelia and I left the apartment behind as stealthily as we could and went to mine. There wasn't a guarantee that it would be any safer, but it felt that way temporarily.

We were both freaked out by the visitor, but if anything it was just more information that we could use, and provided us with more resolve. The next few nights passed by with an actual tone of hope and optimism. I focused on asking questions about Grace herself, hoping that it would lead somewhere.

"Are you different than Amelia?"

She said that she was.

"Who was the man that came to visit us?"

She said he was an enemy.

"What are you?"

She said she didn't know, which was the most disconcerting answer she could have given. I imagined an entity with supposed infinite knowledge, and the only missing piece was the knowledge of its own self.

"Do you want to harm Amelia?"

She said no.

"Do you want to harm anyone?"

No again.

"What do you want?"

She said that she wanted to live.

"Is there a way for us to talk to you for longer at a time?"

Yes.

"How can we talk to you for longer at a time?"

Doctor.

"What doctor can help talk to you for longer at a time?"

Doctor man. Seriously? I was annoyed by that response, thinking that it was unnecessarily vague, and didn't narrow down our options.

"Will that man come for you again?"

Always.

"Does he want to harm you?"

Yes.

"Does he want to harm us?"

Yes.

"Do you want him to find you?"

No.

"Are you alive?"

Barely.

I could always tell when information was important because it would send a chill down my spine. Grace said that she was barely alive, but we didn't know if that meant she was dying or in the process of growth. We kept recording, adjusting our list, and asking more questions.

"Have you always been with Amelia?"

No.

"When did this start for her?"

As a child.

"That was the big one," I said to Amelia the next day, "I think that's exactly what we've been looking for. I don't think we'll ever know exactly what is happening if we don't figure out how it started."

"I've been thinking a lot more about that as well," she said, looking up from her computer. She had spent the past few days searching as much as she could online for similar events to ours, without much luck.

"There's only one thing to do," she continued, "We'd have to find my mother."

Her words carried a lot of weight. Amelia's father died when she was very young, and for the first few years it had just been her and her mother. After 3 years that Amelia can't remember, her mother gave her up for adoption, along with a letter that was kept for her until a certain age.

At that time, Amelia desperately wanted to find her mother and build a relationship with her, until she read her mother's message.

The letter was made up of three sentences.

*Please do not ever attempt to locate or contact me. I will not respond to any communications, and I do not wish to see you. For your safety and my own, please stay away.*

I had read the letter before, and early on in my relationship with Amelia, we had discussed all the possible scenarios, attempting to put the best spin we could on the story.

I had thought of the letter myself in the context of everything that had happened, but had been waiting to bring it up with Amelia, mostly because I wanted to be sure it would help before mentioning it.

"If we're trying to find the start, this has to be something," Amelia said.

"Are you sure?" I asked, "If we ask Grace, I think she can lead us right to her, but that could start more problems than it solves."

"I know."

"We still have time to forget all of it," I said, "Stop the investigation, live with it, maybe use it to help some people. If that guy shows up again, we just call the police. I think this is finally our last turning point."

"I know," she said, "We're going to do this. All the way, whatever it takes."

It didn't take long to find Amelia's mother. Grace gave us the answers we needed, and over the course of just two nights worth of questions, we had enough to find her.

Her name was Susan Kingsley, and she lived about twelve hours from where we were. The trip was difficult on Amelia emotionally, although she mostly stayed quiet and reserved. I had offered to go alone, but we both thought it was a bad idea to put a lot of distance between us.

We made it there the following day, with one overnight question on the way that I didn't reveal to Amelia.

"Does Amelia's mother love her?" I had asked as Amelia looked at me from the passenger seat.

"Yes," Grace said.

Things felt like they would have been much simpler if the answer had just been no.

Once we arrived, we didn't waste any time. Amelia waited in the car, and I went right up to the house. Eventually a woman came to the door. She seemed nice enough, and warm, as she opened the door smiling.

"Hi, can I help you?" she asked.

"Hey, my name is Jack, do you mind if I ask, are you Susan Kingsley?" I responded.

Her entire stance shifted. She lost her smile, and started to shut the door. I wondered if each time she answered the door, she had expected a visit like this.

"Ma'am, please," I said quickly, sticking my foot in the door. I was being more aggressive than I would have liked, but wasn't going to give up this chance.

"No, if it's about her, I can't talk about it, I don't want to think about it," she yelled, all the time pushing on the door against my foot.

"I just have a few questions," I yelled back, "Please, something is happening to her and we just want to understand."

Something came over me, and I couldn't help what I said next.

"I almost killed her."

The shoving on the door stopped, and I could hear Susan start to cry on the other side of the door as she collapsed.

I came in the house and helped move her to a couch. She was crying, and angry at my presence, but it felt like I had strangely made some progress. At least I had made it in the house.

I didn't speak for a while, and just sat there with her. I felt bad that Amelia was just sitting back in the car, but I couldn't risk upsetting Susan again.

After roughly eight minutes, she spoke.

"Amelia was just a little girl." she said.

I didn't say anything. Susan was talking like I wasn't even in the room.

"She was just a little girl," she continued, "Her dad died, and you can't imagine what it felt like. I was lost, but I couldn't be lost because I had her. So she kept me grounded even when I couldn't be. And she was sweet, and she was pure, and she had brown hair."

Her voice broke several times, but especially when she mentioned the brown hair. I listened, but wondered. The Amelia I knew had blonde hair.

"I hadn't been hiking since her father was alive, and after a couple months, I thought it would be therapeutic to go on a short one and take Amelia with me, almost like if there was anyway she could be close to him, maybe it would be something like that," she said, much calmer by that point, and actually making eye contact.

"The hike was fine, and I practically carried her all the way up that little mountain. She absolutely loved it. Her head was on a swivel, bouncing around to look at every leaf that fell past us, or looking out to find one of the birds that had cried," she said, "At the very top of this particular hike, there is a small spring, deep enough to lay in, but only just. I was tired, and I thought we could sit for a minute, then hike back down."

Her hands were shaking.

"I slipped down in the water, and I laid Amelia down on my chest," she said, "Then I closed my eyes, and then I fell asleep."

She watched my face for a beat, and I kept listening.

"She drifted off of me, and I didn't wake up. When I did, I looked, and she was floating, face down on the other side of the spring. I rushed over, pulled her, and just started screaming. I don't really remember what exactly I said, or what I did, but all I could think was 'Please, please, don't let her die.'"

"She didn't," I offered, realizing I hadn't spoken since I came in.

"She did not," Susan said, "In fact, the whole time I was screaming, she was looking up at me, totally fine, scared to death of all the noise I was making. I finally calmed down, and just held her. Once my adrenaline wore off, I realized that something was terribly wrong."

"What?" I asked.

"She wasn't my daughter," she said, "Her hair color was different, her eyes were different. The way her skin felt, the way her nose scrunched. At the time, I knew everything about her, I knew the way that she smelled, and all of it was different from that moment on. So there I was at the top of this mountain holding a child that is looking at me like I'm it's mother, and I have no idea who it is."

I held my breath.

"I searched everywhere that day, and couldn't find anything. I told others what had happened to me, I took her to dozens of doctors, I even got a DNA test done, thinking it would prove that she wasn't the same, but when it came back, it said that it was still her," she said.

"I can't imagine what that felt like," I said, "And I understand that you were scared."

"It was more than that, Jack," she said, surprising me that she remembered my name, "I wasn't just scared, I was angry. She was just a child, and all that fear ended up making me feel and think the most horrible things."

Her words were hitting a little close to home.

"She just did the smallest things that were so strange, and had changed just enough that I couldn't shake the feeling that she just didn't belong. I felt like I was going crazy, and knew that I was overreacting. Months passed, and just kept going. It's like I was under a spell, and it got much worse. I spiraled out of control, and one day, I took her back up on that same hike, right back to the spring where it all started."

I could have finished the story myself. In a way, I already had.

"I took her up there to drown her," she said, giving me a look that hit me with the same emotions I felt when I heard Grace say her name.

I cried in Susan's living room, knowing how closely her story paralleled my own.

"But you couldn't do it, right at that final moment," I managed to say.

"I couldn't, and when I stopped, and I let her go, I looked down at her," she said, "I just couldn't believe what I had done. She was different, and even if I didn't believe she was exactly my daughter from before, I knew I was her mother then, and I had planned this horrible thing. I couldn't understand it. All that hate over something I had loved so much. Then I just couldn't get past it, and I gave her away. I don't know if I did the right thing, but at the very least I didn't think it was safe for her to be around me anymore."

"I don't think any of it was your fault," I said.

"It was my fault," she said, "You being here is just part of it. I knew that someday, someone would show up and ask me questions about her."

"We're just trying to understand. The things that have been happening to us -"

She cut me off by raising my hand and shaking her head.

"I don't want to know," she said, "I do, but I don't, because I don't think I should know. You might not believe this, but I still think the best thing for Amelia is to be away from me. I was scared for myself when she was little, but after that I was scared for her. I can't offer you anything to help except this."

She walked out of the room for a few seconds, and came back with a card. It had a handwritten phone number on it, an address, and the name Howard Mann. I thought back to one of my earlier questions for Grace in which she literally told me "Doctor Mann", but at the time I had misunderstood. I needed to get better at thinking more critically about her answers.

"About two months after I gave her away for adoption, that card came in the mail along with a letter," she said, "I know I gave you the short story, but we went to a lot of doctors. None of them helped, or even really believed me, but I guess word gets around in the medical community, even to the darkest corners. The letter simply said that he had heard the stories, believed them, and could help. He said that he could show me how to truly talk to her."

"You never reached out to him?" I asked.

"I actually did. It was going to my very last effort to poke at this mystery, but it didn't matter," she said, "The day after he sent me that, he killed himself. Tell me, Jack..."

She leaned forward towards me and almost whispered.

"Who would offer to help, and then do something like that?"

I'm writing this to you as we drive out towards this new clue. If anything, the mystery has only grown, but I'm glad we visited Susan. I told the whole story to Amelia, and I almost think she would have gone in to meet her mom, but ultimately it wasn't the right time.

They did see each other through the windows of the house and car though, and even waved right before we left. Amelia had waited nearly her whole life for a moment like that, and I personally don't think the story between them ends there. One day we'll come back with all the answers, and no more questions.

I'll keep you posted on where we [go from here](https://www.reddit.com/user/thebuffed/comments/pplmtp/writing_list_and_faq/).

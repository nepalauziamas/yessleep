Hey, \[REDACTED\],

Thanks for the call. I'm sorry I missed it, ~~I was avoiding it dear God I am not ready to actually talk to you~~ it's the whole "trouble sleeping," you know? I think I am going to call out Monday to just…try and sleep for 12 hours. But hey after emailing you I fell asleep nearly immediately and succeeded at getting more than a couple of hours of sleep uninterrupted?

It was so cool to see your name pop up on my missed call list! ~~And to hear your voice it sounds exactly the same as it did the last time we spoke. How do you still sound like that college guy?~~ I guess we are that generation that won't change out cell numbers, huh? I didn't realize you had moved out to Ireland! How amazing– for work or school? ~~Or following a love? I can't look you up on social media I didn't think about you for fifteen years~~ I always figured you'd be the one to get out of here first. Maybe with the time difference we will be able to chat on the phone some during those insomnia nights I’m having.

Really though, thanks for not just calling my sister to come commit me for 72 hours. I don't think I can take the silence. If… if I keep the background noise high, it keeps them from coming. That sounds like the new season of Stranger Things, have you seen it? ~~It reminds me of all the movies we used to watch, curled up on the couch in your parents basement~~ I swear I am not claiming to be haunted by Vecna or something.

Let me see if I can explain what’s happened. The first time I noticed something going on, ~~I mean I have to admit it had been clearly going on for awhile~~ it was just the sound of a voice in the back of my head. A quiet voice, saying something in …well, in the voice I imagined her to have. I remember being excited that I was starting to be able to get into her head, you know? Like the authors used to talk about.

I kept thinking how lovely her voice is. Hypnotic, really. ~~To everyone else it’s so awkward to their ears they cannot hear her the real her the true~~

The dreams started a few weeks later. Again, they felt like inspiration — my brain finally getting into a world so completely that I could write pages without stop. ~~The easiest audio drama project I’ve worked on. Well the easiest since that project. That project we swore would make us famous that project that I agreed to do despite my gut reaction~~

After a few heavy nights of dreams followed by mornings of copious note taking, the dreams…turned strange. I mean, I was still in the town, just…not a part of town I had ever written about. ~~It looked like that town. That town that we wiped from our memories god damn it those memories~~ The character wouldn’t let me stay in this new part of town. Why would my brain keep bring up this place, but not actually allow me to enter it?

The last dream I had before I truly stopped sleeping well, I had turned up on the corner of this side of town. Again. I looked up to see her, the bright emerald green clothing I had began to associate with her. She shook her head, her eyes deep with concern.

“Why do I keep coming back here,” I asked, frustrated. She didn’t respond, just squeezed my arm tighter. ~~So tight so fucking tight~~ I tried to pry her hand off my arm.

“You’re hurting me,” I cried, as she squeezed tighter. I woke up to a scream on my lips.

It was a few hours later when I saw the bruise mark on my elbow, after wondering why the hell it was so sore.

I know how this sounds. But you have to realize, it was the town. The town with all the details. ~~Did…did we not succeed?~~

~~With love,~~

Talk soon,

Mel

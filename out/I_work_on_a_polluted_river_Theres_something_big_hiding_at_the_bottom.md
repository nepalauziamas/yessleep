My river is so dark and murky, I don't really know if there's even any normal fish in there. Sometimes, stuff moves around so close to the surface that I can see flashes of color, but that's about all. The thing that creeps me out about this is that if something decides to spontaneously pay me a visit, I might end up being none the wiser until it's too late. When I met the snake that Fire had told me about though, I saw it coming from a mile away. 


It had been an alright day thus far. I'd already taken care of Marianna's daily trash bag and was basically just sitting there enjoying the weather. I found out that if I just pinched my nose and ignored the stench, I could look up at the summer sky and pretend that I'm in Venice. I stayed there, just enjoying myself for a little while, when I heard a very deep, enormous sound. The water began to shake, like something insanely big was moving around underneath. Bubbles started showing up on the river's surface, so I knew something was coming long before I spotted it. It was not what I'd expected. 


I caught more and more glimpses of moving shapes; bodies dragging themselves up from the depths. No two of them were the same, but they all looked *sort of* alike—most were hairless, with slick, smooth skin in muted but colorful hues. One swam right by me, its skinny, dark blue arms rapidly flailing as it swept through the murky water. I leaned over the side of the boat to get a better look at it. I had never seen these creatures before. I was frightened and disturbed, but not by them. They were in too big a rush to flee themselves to pose a threat. It was what these unnatural things were trying to escape from that scared me. I wasn't sure if they were able to speak, or if they'd even understand me. I hesitated, (did they even have mouths?) but ultimately called out to the nearest one nonetheless. 


"Hey! Who are you guys? What's going on?"


The blue one whipped its head around to face me for just a moment. Its voice sounded like a raspy, wet cough. "The snake's coming! Get away if you wanna live!"


"Snake?" I repeated, eyes wide.


"Hurry!" the riverperson shouted over their shoulder as the distance between us grew. 


I was still utterly bewildered, but I figured I'd simply have to take their word on it. I jumped behind the wheel and, trying my best not to cause any casualties, started plowing through the mass of writhing bodies. It was like the river had come alive with their fear. One by one, the creatures from below laboriously rolled themselves up onto the riverbank, some of them even attempting to crawl even further into the overgrown weeds, bushes and trees that lined the water's edge. I allowed the boat to run into the dry land, quickly hopping out and pulling it to shore the rest of the way—or at least part of it. I ducked down, seeking cover behind the vessel but peeking out every once in a while as the splashing around me grew louder. I wondered if I was the only human around—the riverside isn't normally all that well-visited, but sometimes there'd be dog walkers or some elderly folks out for a stroll. How would they react to something like this? 


My thoughts were interrupted by the same deep rumbling noise from before, only it seemed much closer this time. I looked up to find the surface of the water breaking as something rose from the bottom. It was scaly, pearlescent and of a pale red color. In the sunlight, it gleamed like pure gold. The body of a snake, the middle part, to be exact. There was neither a head nor a tail end anywhere in sight. Still, the part that was showing was large enough to form a massive arch spanning from roughly a hundred and fifty feet ahead of me all the way to where the lake began. It was fat, too, almost as wide as the river itself. No wonder all these underwater people had taken flight. They would have most likely been forcefully tossed outside by just this movement alone. This thing looked like it could squish me to death if it merely flopped around a little. Seeing it stirred up a strong sense of dread within me, but I couldn't bring myself to avert my eyes from it either. In a bizarre, terrifying way, the snake was beautiful. 


The spectacle was over in the blink of an eye, though. The snake's body dropped back down below the surface, sending an enormous wave of dirty water to splash down on both the riverbanks. I quickly hid behind the boat again, but that didn't stop the water from crashing down on me and within seconds, I found myself drenched from head to toe. The riverpeople instantly began drawing back into the depths and I was left on my own, standing speechless by the water's edge, staring with my mouth agape. Then my phone rang. 


I fumbled it out of my pocket with wet, wrinkly fingers. *"Unknown caller."*


"Hello?"


"Gina, did you see that?" 


I recognized his voice immediately. "It's you. Are you okay? How have you been?" 


"I'm not calling to catch up. Did you see the snake?"


"Yeah. Yeah, I sure did. Phew. My heart's still pounding like crazy," I admitted. "What *is* that thing?"


"A snake."


"Of course, but *what* is it? I mean, I don't know where you grew up but this isn't a snake like I've ever seen before."


"I don't know anything about it, to be honest. I never even saw its head. It lays dormant most of the time, but sometimes, it just needs to stretch, I guess. Of course, that means anything on top of it gets thrown off like a leaf in a storm. You're not hurt though, right?"


"No."


"Okay. I'm glad. You still don't have my number saved, right?"


"I got you as *Unknown Number*, is that alright?"


He sighed. "I guess."


"She's not looking for you," I assured him.


"If you say so." With that, he hung up. He'd sounded pretty unconvinced.


I ended up pushing the boat back onto the lake and waiting another couple hours before ultimately calling it a day. The snake scare was still very much present in my mind and I remember that my fingers didn't stop shaking the entire time. From then on, I viewed the river in a different way. I had known of the snake beforehand, and I'd known of the river people, sort of at least, but I hadn't thought there'd be so many of them. And, more importantly, I hadn't thought that the snake was so huge. I still couldn't believe that this entire affair had gone unnoticed by the general public thus far. I tried to contact my anonymous helper about it, but he didn't respond to any of my texts until around two months later. He has a habit of laying low and just disappearing for weeks on end occasionally. He's kind of paranoid.


About two rather uneventful months after the incident, I spoke with Fire again. He showed up pretty much out of nowhere, simply pulling himself out of the water to look over the side of the boat, and waited for me ato address him. 


"What are you doing here?" I inquired gently after starting a little upon noticing him.


Fire shrugged and brushed a strand of wet copper hair behind his ear. "I was just thinking about you. I figured I'd come up to talk a little."


I frowned in confusion. "That sounds… unlike you."


"Oh, so you know me well enough to tell?" Now there was definitely a little spite in that weird-ass voice of his. 


"I'm sorry, I meant nothing by it. I just thought you didn't like me all that much."


"I don't. But since Grayson still isn't back, and the other folks from down at the bottom seem to think you're kinda neat, I suppose I'm just trying to start thinking of you as tolerable. So you might as well help me out with that." He tilted his head. "Entertain me. I might put in a good word for you with the snake."


"Entertain you how?"


"I don't know. Talk to me. Tell me something interesting."


I sighed. "Look man, I don't know what you want from me. I don't know any stories if that's what you mean."


"Shame. I bet the snake would have liked that."


"I'm not scared of the snake." Now, that was only partially true, but Fire looked impressed so I just ran with it. "I saw it the other day, you know. It's big, sure, but I don't think it means any harm. It could have easily killed a whole bunch of creatures, and me too, but it didn't. It only, like, moved around a little. So no, I'm not afraid of it. I don't think it's got any bad intentions."


"You're actually right about that. I know it pretty well, you see."


"Can you talk to it?" I asked.


"Yes. We communicate regularly, though you probably wouldn't describe it as talking. We have our ways."


"What is it, exactly?"


Fire gave me a half-smile. "What do you think it is?"


I tilted my head back, looking up at the sky. "I'm not sure. I was thinking of this old story I read once, from Norse mythology. I used to be really into that kinda stuff. Anyways, you've got Loki, this trickster god, and he's a real asshole and he goes around cheating on his wife with a giantess or something, I don't rightly know anymore. But he gets her pregnant and she gives birth to a bunch of fucked up kids, one of which is this huge, ever-growing serpent they name Jormungandr. The gods then throw it into the sea where it gets so big it wraps around the entire earth. I thought our snake might be a little bit like that."


Fire now seemed quite intrigued. He'd leaned further over the railing, his eyes wide with soft astonishment. "You think it might be a god?"


"Maybe. It's beautiful. What I've seen of it at least. It seemed sort of deity-like for sure."


Fire had a dreamy look on his face, staring off into the distance.


"You okay?" I inquired. "Don't you know what it is? I thought you two had a connection or whatever."


"That doesn't mean I know everything about it. But I like your idea. It's kind of… cool. I guess."


"Yeah. It *would* be neat if it was a deity. I mean, who else could say something like that about themselves? To have come face to face with an ancient god?"


"Not too many of your people, that's for sure," Fire replied genially.


"By the way, how come no one seems to notice stuff like this happening around here? You'd think a giant river monster appearing like that would draw some public attention, right?" I wondered aloud.


"There's a good reason for that, actually. But I don't think I want you to know. It'd scare you off for sure."


"Didn't you *want* me to leave?" I reminded him.


He gave me a sour look. "Don't be a cow about it." With that, he let go of my boat and dropped back below the water's surface.


I actually saw the snake again not long after that. It had very suddenly started raining while I was pretty far out on the lake, and I was in a hurry to get back to dry land in order to keep from getting drenched. Just as I was starting up the boat though, I heard a deep rumbling noise and I was instantly reminded of the first time I'd encountered the serpent. This time however, the sound wasn't as loud and there were no riverpeople taking flight. I waited, standing still atop my vessel and gazing across the water with bated breath. Then, from the far end of the lake, something very slowly started rising from the depths. I could see the wave it created rolling along way before the object even broke through the surface. It was the tail end of that same shiny, scaly entity. It moved up as carefully as its great size allowed and came to a halt just before it reached my boat, which was rocked by the wave nonetheless. I had to cling onto its side in order to stay on top.


To my surprise, the tail arched to form something akin to a bridge above my head. I stood rooted to the spot, gaping at the snake's glistening, dripping underbelly. I didn't know what to do—I felt that primal fear again, my heart was pounding away frantically, but I was in awe nonetheless. That's when I realized there was nothing to be afraid of. Looking up, I noticed that the serpent's body was shielding me from the weather like an umbrella. The rain couldn't get to me anymore. My breaths remained shallow and much too soft, but I sat back down. I found that I could touch the beast if I just reached out with my arm. It felt smooth and sort of nice, which threw me off a little since I'd totally expected it to be slimy. The snake stayed in place, and I settled in beneath it to wait out the rain.

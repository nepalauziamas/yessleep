I'm sorry this isn't the story that belongs on here, at all, but I think the are plenty of people who understand love comes with thorns. I lost my grandpa today and I can't say I missed him but I know I loved him. Love is words, it starts in your emotions and your words gather the attention of other hearts and thoughts and THAT ENERGY CREATES love. Brick by brick even if a broken home it makes.... I loved my grandpa and he taught me what love is, in his memory I thought I would share me text back to my grandma. I loved scary stories around a fire and with those memories we're creating love for better or worse... with all my love and forgive me any typos I just copied and pasted. 

ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ I'm sorry grandma, love you BUNCHES. I'm glad he's on the beach, Kim and Doran created the greatest little heaven on earth down there due retirement. They deserved, praying that stays the family legacy to live pass through generations to always know you'll come back to the perfect of the beach and family in the end. They gave him a great end and I love them ask very much, trying not to cry I miss all those family moments and wish I cried l could give that t0 my kids so much. The Christmas eve and barbeques where you only felt like you were loved and wanted by every face looking back at you. Even if you just killed my cat kicked my kid or just shot me.... you better tell me and not lie cuz that I won't get mad you loved me enough to feel guilty and get me that stupid shirt at the store you thought I'd like gift of a sorry... you loved me enough to tell me I pray I I can trust you to be honest but everyone fucks up I forgive you. Hug it out and move on...


I'll forever remember that laugh whenever I see a white rat. Love and laughter forever in my heart. I was raised to believe that's family, that's love really when no matter what... kill my cat or just act like a dick for the ride to my job interview... honestly that's how I picture it down on the beach for grandpa, surrounded by the people that loved me enough to hate me anyway safe and cared for. The generations have added technology and don't talk to each other anymore, and that love is unspoken in those family moments but forgotten through text so it may be easier to hide and hurt each other more. If grandpa was there it meant like it or not we are family asshole give me hug and we'll see who's kissing whose ass. He didn't care enough to think a thought long enough to ever imagine your feelings and sometimes it hurt, that's my family, he was the anchor you had to go.... the truth is spoken with love and sometimes it hurts but I'll never be able to kick you out of this family you jerk. 

On the beach in Belize there's a piece of beach where you can't lie and life has color. Arguments and love songs you have to SPEAK first to add your paintbrush to the canvas. It's real hard to give that love to my kids through a screen. It never felt right to talk to grandpa on the phone, his love was dry and quick like his voice but you felt if you were with him.... on the phone it was cold and you had to actually SAY SOMETHING instead of laugh it off or punch his arm jokingly and the barrier of the love of dad who is only telling you the truth like it or not. That family love means I'm not gonna hold back, it's a childhood u can no longer recreate. Today I was actually having a talk with my kids about love language and that real friends need to handle the fireworks. In my family be open and honest and hang on for the ride. Once you're in you're in until you walk away the door is alwaysÂ  open. A party that may be lame but entertaining or if you're lucky enough to love hard and wild with stories to tell and tears to shed you may get a show that lasts longer than the Christmas in okeechobee with my family...... its tough sometimes but I know that's love.

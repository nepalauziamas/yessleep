This came up so sudden. It started with me finding a CD with my name and birthdate on it. I watched the video on it and saw creepy things I am now about to be faced with… as the video threatened. A man with a tall head starred in the video. The video was of him… well I'm not sure what he was doing exactly, but it sounded dangerous. The police were notified. This is the update.


Alexandria arrived. We both sat on the couch. It was silence between us for the most part. We would speculate for a couple seconds, but that would be it. We were both visibly shaking. Moments after Alexandria arrived, Officer Clint came back in check on us.


"Are you two good?" Officer Clint asked. "We have reinforcements on stand by. They have the place surrounded. Some officers are in disbelief, but they're going to do their job. Follow any orders I give you."


I checked my phone. 1:32 PM. Alexandria still had a nervous look on her face. Dread was pounding me. I thought about what may have happened to James, what may happen to Alexandria and I. My nerves were tight. The thing with the tall head was stalking us. It recorded a couple of my memories and then it played them back for me in a video.


We continued to sit in silence. Officer Clint was sitting in the kitchen, speaking into his radio. I felt a sinking feeling when I overheard the officer on the other end.


"There's reports of property damage at Alexandria Livingston's residence," the officer said.


"Kitchen?" the officer responded.


"Yeah, we... checked the video again. The damage seems to match. Whoever filmed it knew... how to replicate it well," the officer said.


"Reinforcements. We don't know what it is. We cannot dismiss this," Officer Clint said.


Officer Clint got up from the chair and walked up to us. "Whatever it is, it has arrived," Officer Clint said.


"You don't think it's a costume? You'd believe us if we said it was a… thing? A creature?" I asked.


"Yes. It seems very familiar to me. I might just be playing tricks with myself by now, as I've witnessed tons of bad things like dead bodies, people shooting each other, good people going insane... but this though… It's bugging me right now. You said you think he's wearing a costume? I thought you'd find me crazy too," Officer Clint said.


The officers began to shout over the radio.


"10-31! 10-45! 10… 10-80? 10-80!"


"10-4, acknowledgement. This is Officer Clint, I am at the Matthews household," Clint responded.


Gunshots rang out on the other end. The adrenaline rush made me more anxious than I already was. Soon, the gunshot noises stopped. Clint repeated himself a couple times, but no one answered. Everything was silent. Nothing was coming from the other end.


"I need to go and check. I'm going to make sure that monster doesn't get to you two. Don't move," Officer Clint said.


"What were the numbers referring to specifically?" I asked.


"Here in Ontario, 10-80 means Special Situation, 10-31 means someone is injured, 10-45 is sudden death. Anyway I don't have time, the officers outside are going to protect you," Officer Clint said.


He rushed up the stairs like lightning. As he rushed outside, he almost brought the front door down with him.


I was anxious the whole afternoon, waiting to see how my fate would go. I didn't know a thing about the creature. I wished I knew how to stop it at least, due to all the fear I had over it. I didn't assume I was going to die, as James wasn't found dead. He was just missing. I hoped.


"There's really something stalking us right now… we don't even know what it wants to do to us," I said.


"Yeah, this just came up so randomly. It's like… why?" Alexandria asked.


Officer Clint returned about a half an hour later. I was sitting in silence, lost in thought as he walked in. I overheard him speak to Alexandria.


"The officers guarding your home have disappeared. I can't find any of them, their radios, or anything from them, on your property or at any nearby store they could have slacked off to," Officer Clint said.


She nodded her head, remaining silent. As Officer Clint walked towards the kitchen, some officers began freaking out over his radio. They were the officers standing outside, going by the fact I could hear them shouting from outside at the same time.


"The culprit? Looks like him"


"Identify yourself!"


"Don't move!"


A low hum was heard. The electric buzzing of tasers followed. They lasted a few seconds, then multiple gunshots rang out.


"10-31, backup needed. Officer down!"


"This is Officer Clint, are you there? Describe the culprit"


Things were silent again. I was frozen.


"What does this thing think it's doing?" Officer Clint asked himself.


"Stay right here," Officer Clint said. "We made sure another officer would come down here if I left. If he's no longer out there, or dead, I'm coming back down."


I stayed on the couch, wondering what I could do if the creature made it down to me. At that point, the officers were gone. I could hear Officer Clint shouting all over the place outside.


"Where are you?"


"Reveal yourself!"


"I've had enough of this!"


...are some of the things I remember him shouting. After a couple moments of silence, he shouted something I couldn't make out. A couple loud bangs rang out from the distance. I couldn't tell what had happened though. Everything was silent for the following hour.


"I hope he isn't dead," Alexandria said.


The air was dead silent for a few more minutes before Alexandria spoke again.


"Okay, I don't care what anybody says. I'm leaving. Let's go. Maybe the man won't attack us if we are in a public place," She said.


"There's no way he's getting in here with the police around," I said.


"It doesn't sound like they're out there anymore," She said.


"Reinforcements," I said. That might have sounded idiotic at the time. I could've assumed the police were no longer standing around outside. Instead, I assumed the man would've walked in already. Alexandria and I would've been dead. I hoped that any reinforcements, be it more police, the ERT, or even the army would be able to do enough to keep the man away. The uncertainty was killing me.


"We don't know what this thing is. The police officers at my house disappeared without a trace, apparently. We're not going to sit here and wait for our lives to end. Let's go," She said.


As I got up from my seat, the front door creaked open. Soft footsteps creeped down the stairs. A police officer walked into view. It wasn't Officer Clint.


"What are you two doing down here?" the officer asked. "Put those down. The creature was shot dead. He's done," the officer said.


"I'm going to freak out if we can't leave," Alexandria said. "We need to go somewhere where the man can't find us."


He chuckled and shook his head. As he shook his head, his nose slightly shifted to the left.


"The dumb video was a warning," I said to Alexandria. "I wish I never watched it. I wish I left the DVD outside."


"We should just scratch it up so it can't play anymore," Alexandria said as she looked towards me.


I thought about the video. It felt like something was tugging me towards defending it, but at the same time, I knew not to trust the video at all. On one hand, it had nostalgic value, but otherwise, a thing with a tall head creeped into my head, recorded a couple of my memories in greater detail than I could recall them in, then the thing put those memories in a video. Both memories were from when I was a child. How long was it stalking me for? I wondered.


"You don't have to worry about the DVD," the officer said. "It didn't hurt you. Remember the nostalgic stuff?" the officer asked. I was frozen at this point. Scratch the DVD or let it keep working? It was a weird hesitation. I shouldn't have been unsure about it, yet I was. I was being tugged by something. Not average nostalgia though. That's not what it felt like. It was off. It wasn't consistent with my morals or rational thinking. It felt like something was in my head, tugging me.


"Andrew… if you can't decide, I'll scratch it up myself," Alexandria said.


"Come on, we can watch the good parts of the DVD. Not the bad parts," the officer said.


"That won't matter because I'm going to scrape the disk across the ground," Alexandria said, walking past me. She walked towards the console. The officer ran in front of her, breathing in a quick rhythmic pattern that threw the last bit of comfort I had out the window.


"Why not smash it? Scratching it will do harm," the officer said.


I thought it was strange the officer specifically preferred the CD to be smashed rather than scraped and scratched. How would it only do harm to him if the disk was scratched? I wondered.


"You can stop now. I won't hurt you," the officer said.


"I'm going to scratch it. I'm going to scrape it up against a wall," she told the officer.


The officer's eyes began to turn white. I began to feel cold.


"Um, Andrew, are you seeing this?" She asked.


"Yeah… enough of this," I said.


The officer's arms flew upwards. The sleeves on his suit disappeared, revealing black sleeves clamped to his arms. My stomach began to close in on itself. The officer's head grew taller. At that point, I knew it wasn't an officer. His head had become two times taller than a normal human head, his nose had turned into a glitchy mess… It was him.


Alexandria took a step back. We both knew we couldn't outrun this thing, considering how fast it moved in the video. I was about to admit to my fate right there, as there was nothing I thought I could do. Then the creature disappeared. It was quick, but it looked like it shrunk. The pit in my stomach grew deeper. It was one thing to see the creature, but not knowing where it was… was creepier. I saw Alexandria take a look around while breathing heavily.


"I saw him go down somewhere," I said, staring at the floor. I looked all over the floor. Both of us stomped the ground in case we'd kill it. But it couldn't have been that dumb, right?


Something occurred to me as I searched for the man. He asked for the DVD he was on to be smashed instead of scratched. He was pushy about it. He said it would cause damage. Based on his defense… It seemed like something would happen to the man if the DVD was scratched up. If the data side of the CD was scraped with something, or on something, it wouldn't be able play anymore. I felt like I was on to something, but I wasn't sure what. I wanted Alexandria to take a shot in the dark and scratch the CD until it couldn't be played anymore. Based on how the man talked, scratching the CD would do something to him. But what? I hoped it would get rid of him for good at most.


I began to theorize that the man with the tall head was influencing my brain to think about the nostalgic stuff that was on the DVD, so I would refuse to destroy its data. There was no way I would ever defend it as much as I was. Alexandria didn't have any of her memories put on the CD, so she couldn't be swayed by any such nostalgia. She didn't care about the CD at all, so she had to be the one to scratch it. She was so afraid of this man, she was beginning to look angry.


While looking around on the floor, I had a flash of a memory of me playing Cyberpunk 2077 at James' house a couple of months earlier. James was sitting to my right, and the man with the tall head was sitting to my left. I recalled the man's long arms, glitchy looking nose, then I felt a sense of familiarity. His inverted eyes, tall head, all his features, popped into my mind's eye. The man with the tall head sat beside me, watching me play the game. He was smiling, which I found odd. I forgot how odd it felt though. I only remembered that it was odd.


A few more flashes popped up into my mind's eye. One of riding a roller coaster at Canada's Wonderland, one of watching a scary movie, and some of eating at various restaurants. The man with the tall head was sitting beside me in each of them. He was smiling, in a way that looked purposeful rather than genuine. Sometimes he stared as he smiled. Staring without moving or changing expressions.


I was surprised I was familiar with the man. I recalled him smiling at me without moving his eyes. Without blinking. I would've assumed he was staring off into space, but then I recalled him saying hello to me. It was said to me in the middle of each of his staring episodes.


Why didn't I remember any of this like that before? I wondered.


"Andrew, do you suddenly remember the guy with the tall head sitting with you at restaurants and stuff? Because I suddenly do," Alexandria asked.


"Yeah, I think he was my friend or something. He's always been a bit creepy though with the staring," I said.


Alexandria looked at her phone for a few seconds. She told me she couldn't find the man in her contacts.


"I think I remember putting him in mine," I said. I took out my phone, scrolled through my contacts, swearing I had his number, but I couldn't find it. I then realized I should be able to remember his name if he was so prevalent in my life.


"Alexandria, do you remember the man's name?" I asked. "I'm blanking out on it."


"No, I'm drawing a blank on his name too."


It was weird, but I felt tugged towards a feeling of familiarity when it came to the man.


"What he was doing was probably just a prank," I said.


"Yeah," Alexandria said. She was no longer shaking.


I could only vaguely recall the events since Tuesday. I was hit with a rushing sense of euphoria.


Alexandria and I spent the rest of the day watching movies, laughing at memes, and eating chips. I enjoyed these moments as much as any moments prior to Tuesday afternoon. That evening, I read funny comments under interesting posts on Askreddit until I fell asleep.


I awoke to pure darkness. The lights were off, it was dark outside, I heard Alexandria breathing in her sleep. I assumed she fell asleep before deciding to go anywhere. I got up to use the bathroom. On my way there, I thought about the man. What I found weird was... I couldn't recall when or where I met him, or who he was. I couldn't recall any actual interactions he had with any others either. But my interest in thinking about that stuff switched off all of a sudden. I walked into the bathroom.


I was startled by the sound of the bathtub curtain railing falling onto the floor of the bathtub. As I walked into the bathroom, something rubbery in texture wrapped around my head. It was followed by the low frequency sound I ever heard. It pierced my ears hard. I felt disoriented. I was then bombarded with flashes of the man with the tall head smiling at me. At one point, it began to get creepy. Chilling. Next thing I knew, I was floating. Or, it felt like I was floating. My sense of direction had disappeared. I couldn't feel the floor anymore. A few seconds of confusion ensued before I fell. Not too far, but I held my breath out of instinct. I landed on a surface that wasn't too hard. The hum of electricity returned. Whatever was squeezing my head let it go, yet I still couldn't see anything at all. After a few more minutes of confusion, I touched whatever was covering my eyes. It was a blindfold. I took it off. I placed the blindfold in my lap. I began to notice my surroundings while doing so.


I was sitting in a room with light grey walls. The room was the size of an average storage room. To my left, I noticed there was an eye-sized hole on the wall, cut in the shape of an eye. I got up to take a peek inside. It was just darkness until a red eye with a triangular pupil opened. A series of tapping sounds trickled across the other side of the wall. Then a loud scream-like growl that sounded like someone sipping an almost empty drink through a straw, but deeper, growled from behind the wall as well. It was weird, but uncanny and chilling. I felt like an intruder.


I walked up to the grey metal door, thinking I could get out of the room. I turned the knob, but it wouldn't budge. I looked back at the hole to see if the eye was still peeking through the hole. That was when the tapping stopped. A long string insect, like a very thin snake, crawled out of the hole. It slithered around the hole for a few seconds, then it began to slither towards me. I assumed it was something malicious the man with the tall head sent after me. A pit formed in my stomach. I knocked on the door. No answer came from outside. I knocked again. No answer. The snake was about midway to where I was standing.


A series of loud bangs that sounded like gunshots rang out outside the room. A couple loud booms caused the room to vibrate. I glanced back at the snake. It had paused in its tracks, hanging on the wall to the left of the door. A voice called out to me from outside the room.


"If anyone is in there, make sure you are far from the door"


I stepped back from the door. I walked back towards the chair, then I stood up against the wall at the back of the room. Another minute of gunshots later, there was a banging on the door. Followed by an ear piercing metallic screech. The door was pushed off its hinges and fell to the ground with a thud. A man in what looked like SWAT gear, but a bit heavier, and unmarked, stood outside the doorway. A cloud of dust occupied the space behind him. The silhouette of a tall figure ran by. It's speed was unnatural and chilling. The man in the heavy suit spoke.


"You aren't supposed to be here," he said. "Not that it's your fault. Please stay calm. We're going to get you home."


Calm? There were weird creatures on the other side of the wall, a gunfight was happening outside, a heavily armoured person was telling me to stay calm… I mean, he could've instead just told me to acknowledge my own feelings, but I guess it was too urgent. This situation was too scary and confusing to remain calm in. The adrenaline was choking my nerves. Just as I thought about asking the armoured man what was going on, he pulled a purple gun out of his belt. He pointed it at me. He told me it wouldn't hurt. I had no idea what to expect. It just looked like he was going to shoot me dead. But it wouldn't hurt? He turned a dial on the side of the gun, then he pulled the trigger.


I woke up in the back of a van. There was medical equipment and scanners sitting not too far away from me. Two armoured men sat across from each other, speaking to one another.


"...this will be stressful. That's what they said. It makes sense too."


"Yeah, we- oh, Victim 80 is awake"


Victim 80? What was happening? I was still freaking out on the inside. Adrenaline rushing hard. I was about to have a panic attack from all the confusion, chaos, and having nowhere to run to. What was the grey room? Who was shooting who outside of it? Where was I? Are these armoured suits the good guys? I just wanted to be at home. The stress had built up enough.


"Acknowledge every thought you have without acting on them. You will be home soon," the one on the left said.


Feeling exhausted, I only managed to ask them one thing.


"Is that man with the tall head dead?"


"No," the one on the left said. "He got away again. We are here to make sure his victims are safe at the very least. If you get caught again, we'll come to your aid. Make sure you check for any blank CDs and DVDs. Ones that have a full name, numbered birth date and numbered receive date on them. That thing thrives off of being encoded information on the back of CDs. Scratching the CDs beyond replayability will deter it. We've informed Alexandria and James about this as well."


"Unfortunately we haven't been able to find all the CDs he's connected to," the one on the right said. "And further investigation found that if there's one CD, there's likely another."


"All of them would have to be scratched beyond playability at the same time," the one on the left said.


"We can't say anything more," the one on the right said.


I reached for my phone to check the time. It was 3:06 AM. I didn't have any service however. I couldn't message anybody. I slid my phone back into my pocket. I rested my head, attempting to get some sleep.


I woke up half asleep in my living room. I swear I remember the armoured men putting me on my couch, then I fell back asleep sometime right after.


I woke up to the morning light. Looking at the window, I saw a cloudy sky outside. Alexandria was sleeping on the other side of the couch. I checked my phone for the time again. 9:34 AM. After waking up some more, I recalled the room, then the van. Everything about the man with the tall head, then the damn CD. I checked the news on my phone. There was nothing about the man with the tall head, any government intervention, a number of victims of any creature, or any armoured people having been in gunfights.


"Hey, are you good?" Alexandria asked.


"Yeah, I got captured last night, but I was saved by some military guys," I told her.


"Me... too," she said. "I woke up to the sound the man makes, then I ended up in this... room with a snake thing that bit me on the arm. I pulled it off of me," She showed me her left arm. There was a mild bite wound. It didn't look too deep. She rolled her sleeve back over it. "Victim 81," she said.


"Victim 80."


Alexandria walked into the living room. I followed behind. She pressed a button on the console, ejecting the 2022-07-26 CD from the console. The nostalgic feelings were gone. I recalled all the moments I hung out with the man. Each of them were clear. The man was no longer in any of them. Alexandria grabbed the CD and stood back up. She observed the front of the disk.


"We were tricked by him. He put himself into our memories so we'd think he was our friend this whole time," she said.


"Yeah, so we'd let our guards down. I still don't know what he wanted," I said.


Alexandria flipped her hair back while holding the CD in her right hand. She walked over to the wall I was standing beside. She put the shiny side of the CD against the wall, then she scraped the CD up and down against the wall repeatedly. She scratched it for at least 10 seconds. I was relieved, hoping this was over.


She observed the back of the CD.


"Hopefully, that'll be enough to get rid of him," I said.


"I'll throw this away," she said.


Alexandria walked into the kitchen. She dropped the CD in the garbage, then she walked back towards me. She looked as relieved as I felt. Right then, it occurred to me that James had a similar CD. I took out my phone to text him, hoping he was rescued as well.


"If you were rescued… the way to get rid of the man with the tall head is to scratch up the CDs it sent us, so it can't play with us so to speak."


A minute later, he responded. To my excitement.


"He got you too? Are you alright?"


"Yes. Alexandria as well. We're both alright now. If you have a CD with your name on it, scratch it up so it can't work anymore."


"Don't worry about that. I told my dad about the man, where I was last night (I was in some room with a bunch of snakes,) and that some government guys told me I'll be alright if I looked out for any CDs with my name in it. I found the CD, then I snapped it in half."


"Snapping it doesn't stop him. Scratching it does. I think he encodes himself into the CDs somehow," I responded.


"Oh god. I'll scratch the pieces up then. I'm glad I'm safe. My parents hugged me hard when they saw me lol"


At around 11, Alexandria went back home. At 4 PM, she told me her kitchen was going to be rebuilt. Redone too, as it might as well have been anyway.


The following day, I visited her house to play video games. At one point, she asked me to get something from her room. She told me it was in her closet. I went up to her room to go look for it. As I was sifting through stuff in her closet, I found a DVD without a cover. It had a CD inside it.


"2022-07-26 - Alexandria Livingston - Birthday: 05-16-2001" was written on the CD.


I was curious as to how Alexandria didn't notice this. I took the CD out of its case. As I attempted to flip it around to check the back of it for scratches, it fell out of my hands and landed on the floor. I didn't hesitate to drag the CD back and forth across the floor repeatedly, scratching it to oblivion.


I picked the CD up and took it downstairs to show Alexandria. I told her I found it in her room. I held it in front of her. She asked me if she could see it. I handed it to her. As she looked at the front of the disk, she developed a look of disgust. She turned it around.


"I already scratched it," I said.


Her look of disgust vanished as she observed the back of the CD.


"Okay, good," she said. She handed the CD back to me. "If I get another one of those, I'm ready to just scratch the hell out of it. Against a wall, across the floor, with car keys, whatever. I know snapping won't help, so I won't be snapping it," she continued.


"How did you come up with the idea of scratching the disk before we were told to scratch the disks?" I asked.


"That's just what I thought about doing to it. It was a bad video, and I wanted to make sure no one would ever have to see it again," Alexandria said.


"Of course. Oh, and, why didn't your parents come with you to my house?" I asked.


"They… it's… I'm not comfortable talking about them right now, but they told me they thought I'd be safer where there's more police and less threatened destruction," Alexandria said.


I observed the back of the CD I was holding. It was scratched to oblivion. I stepped into the kitchen and tossed the CD into the trash bin. That was enough of that. After that, Alexandria and I went right back to playing video games.

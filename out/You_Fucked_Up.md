We took what we could. All of it hidden and contained. I’ve been pawning what I could, ignoring everyone who might feel differently. Every item was notably of worth or valuable, and for that same reason there shouldn’t have been an issue.  

“Fucking finally!” I exclaim in bouts of ecstasy, legal tender within my grasp.

Fifteen hundred dollars in hand I walk about to my usual places enjoying what little freedom and yield I can surmount into pleasure and happiness. 

I return after the turn of an hour worn and exhausted. I find a comfortable area and rest.

The next day I awake to a call.

“Hello?” I half mumble.

“You really fucked up….”

*CLICK*

A click distinct and synonymous in it’s loudness disrupted my peaceful fog; still disoriented I found clarity.

‘I’m not sure who that was.’ I thought. 

“I’m not safe.” I thought aloud.

My paranoia still leading me as I grew to believe that if he figured out my number it was only a smooth drop to figuring out where I was.

“Fuck!” I exclaimed.

In any event I wished to avoid injury or death. Repeatedly reminding myself in paranoia to find somewhere safe. I quickly made a call to a few friends. 

I answer to a response of, “On my way!”

I respond hurriedly, “Thank you.”

*CLICK*

“I have to get to the meeting spot.”

“Hurry!” I remind myself.

I conceal my face. I grab my bag and my backpack and begin to work my way down the road. I was suddenly jumped by three faces pale and ghost like.

“Did you wish to die?”, asked the first. 

“Do you wish to die currently?”, followed the second. 

“Do you wish to die later?”, finished the third.

I had no idea who they were, what they were,  or what they were asking me.

“Me? What?”

I looked bewildered. Their faces translucent and reflective. I could see my own in each of them. I chuckled anxiously, hoping they wouldn’t get offended. 

“Haha… what?..”

 No, if you were wondering luckily they didn’t.

“You will die later. We all do.” Two faces responded. 

I stared on ignorantly. I smiled at the two of them, tears strewn in their eyes. The two repeated themselves, the third spoke indiscernibly, mumbling, and grumbling. It was like… studying something. 

“We speak (8 wounded 3 dead) as a collective. (Robbery) We are together. (She stole him) Do not fret, (We won’t be left like you) for you stand before us (Irreparable) attempting to find safety. (We will watch you die) What is your (Arson) focus on? (Dead, they’re all dead) What do you hear between these words? (You never checked on them) What do you hear?”

“Nothing… wha- Nothing…. What are you? Why are you… talking… to *me*?”

At times I could hear my name, at others I could hear my past and hobbies, my history with criminals and criminal acts. I believe at times it would even speak of those I’d helped further and where they were now. 


The ghostly faces began to illuminate. 

I stood and waited for a response.

I fought the urge to run. 

Eyes blinded by light.

I could not see. 

I couldn’t run. 

I felt fear.  

“No. No. No! Fuck off!”

So I told them to fuck off. 

They started screaming and yelling as a siren sounded in the distance. 

Their faces turned inhuman, menacing, scary.

The faces began to illuminate brighter as though they were bright white lights. I searched around me still waiting for the afterimage of the blinding light to dissipate so I could escape safely or at least plan it out or be knowledgeable of my surroundings.  

The faces placed me in handcuffs. I awoke in a mental hospital handcuffed to a bed. Where a quick conversation transpired between a doctor and I,

“You were experiencing one of many forms of schizophrenia.”

I give no response. 

“Are you okay”

I give no response. 

“I need to know that you are okay,” their hand on my shoulder, “Are you seeing anything that isn’t here? Maybe hearing something that doesn’t exist? Any feelings of paranoia, depression, anxiety, volubility?”

At this moment I’m attempting not to mislead myself or be led askew. I try my best not to:

a) Fight them and further hospitalization.
b) Ask anything for whatever reason in any sense.
c) Run from them.
d) Answer them.

They ask again and again if I’m okay. At that moment I’m doing my best not to stay. I answer yes and I ignore the rest of he questions. 

 
“Now that I’ve told you everything, officer, am I free to go?”

“Carry on. Continue to when we brought you here to the station.”

After this I was given medication. I was told to take the medication daily. I used the restroom and broke a capsule open to inspect it. It seemed fine. 

You lead me to a vehicle after once again handcuffing me and escorting me out of the facility. You aided me in entering and I nearly fell after being pushed. I was taken back to the police station. I was then handcuffed to a table and here we are.

“*Now* that I’ve told you everything, officer, where am I to go? I’m the one who called you.”

The officer hands me my medication.

“What do you want me to do with this!?” I yell.

“Take your meds and calm down.”

I do as instructed, waiting for clarity and aid.

“Officer?” I question. 

“Wait for your medication to take effect.”

Moments pass.

Three men enter with flash lights under their chins. Mirrors in their opposite hands. 

“Officer?” I half mumble now medicated.

Their faces lit from their chins.

“What do you hear?” They ask.

“You really fucked up….” The officer responded. 

(Yes, I’m the one who called you.)

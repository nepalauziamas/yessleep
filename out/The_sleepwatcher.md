To my recollection, I have encountered this man or being, whatever it may be in the past, I'm not quite sure if my own brain is a reliable source any longer, for it has been twisted and altered into his shaping; a mere test rat is what I prove to be for him. 

I awoke from a pleasant sleep in the very early hours of dusk to an overwhelming sensation of dread, I slightly opened my curtains to gain a perspective into what time I had a awoke, the empty blackness of night filled me with an uncomfortable fear of the unknown, however, I did not expect to be greeted by it: the embodiment of evil, my sentence for the sins I have committed.


A strangely familiar face, I was greeted by, this did not help ease the fear however, just amplified, almost as if I knew I was about to be dragged through hell and spat out the other end. 

He pressed his face against my window, a fairly ordinary looking man, carrying a menacing grin that exuded the darkest, most depraved pleasure at my fear, giddy with excitement over what, I wasn't sure but did not have any desire to find out. 

"We've met once before" he or it exclaimed, "but this time I want to put you through the darkest hell you can imagine but several times worse"




He began playing music, a shrill, hearse like chorus began blaring into my ears from an unknown source, "what do you want from me" I manged to whimper, a sinister smile graced his face, animalistic and lacking of any humanity or empathy, " you think you're the only one" 

He told me that he has a deep hate for me, and wants to see the end of my life, he will stop at nothing until I am but a memory. The music began to crescendo into a disturbing climax full of faded cries and shrieks, he shared the same menacing grin, and stopped the music. 

"I think I've done enough damage for one night" He giggled while whispering, "ill let you attempt to rest, you'll need it because we will meet soon and you will never know where and when"
I have attempted to find this man, the term "sleepwatcher" grants me hardly anything to go by, there have been others I have found with experiences near identical to myself. This man or creature has cast a hateful and dark shadow upon my everyday life, I have driven myself to the deepest depths of insanity searching for answers that my family and friends have began to drift away and become mere strangers to me, as have i to them. 

As the days drag and the nights even longer, waiting for him to appear to me once more, I turned to religion, began praying and repenting for my sins, but I can feel him sinking into my skin, hear him laughing and grimacing with amusement at the relationships he has destroyed and my willingness for life slipping away. 

I will not grant him the opportunity to meet again.

[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/inrkyj/tales_from_a_small_town_i_met_the_most_feared_man/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) | "Or my personal favorite: *Leslie Torres withered my crops, killed my donkey and put a dead raccoon in my well*. See, the raccoon thing was true but the donkey was totally an accident and the crops are just bullshit."

I ducked down, almost wishing for the car seat to swallow me whole while at the same time eyeing the man driving. My mind was racing. This was Leslie Torres. I was riding shotgun with Leslie fucking Torres. 

Our eyes met when he looked over at the glass bottle I was holding in my trembling hands. After I had washed up back at the bar, I had sneaked it from their fridge, promising myself to pay for it afterwards. Before I knew it, he had reached over and taken it from me. A word of protest died in my throat when he raised it to his lips and took a few swift gulps, only to pull a face and groan.

"Why is this so sweet? And what's that… *weird* taste? There's not even alcohol in here, what the fuck is this?"

"Fruit smoothie," I muttered. 

"Ah, gross," said Mr Torres. "Out it goes."

With that, he hurled the bottle out the car window. I heard it shatter somewhere outside. I winced. Maybe I should have said something about wanting to actually drink the rest but after the rim of the bottle had met with his lips that wish had left me together with the smoothie itself. 

"Oh hey," my driver remarked, chuckling as he leaned over to look after it. "I think it flew right up against this guy's door."

I gave a forced nervous giggle, hoping he wouldn't notice how worried I was. He did though.

"Hey now, don't be like that." He reached over and nudged me in the side. I don't think he wanted it to hurt, but I flinched. "Pepper, sweetie, you're a Bennett, right?"

I nodded, uncertain of what would follow.

"Good. Glad I got that right." He nodded to where the bottle had flown. "That was the Lewises' door right there."

That actually got a chuckle out of me. Sure, we were sitting in Torres' car and he was taking me out of town to a place I didn't know, but pissing off the Lewises is kind of like eating pizza–no matter what situation you're in, it always makes things a little better. I stared at the sound half of his face from where I was sitting without noticing it at first.

"Is it the scars?" he eventually said. I hurried to apologize but he cut me off. "Can it. Not into the soft tour. I know how I look and so do you, no need to be weird about it. Either way, I had them when I woke up. I don't know anything about them."

"We got something in common then," I said, raising my wrists to show him the scars running along my veins. 

He frowned. "Did you–"

"Nope. Didn't. I woke up with them too. That's what I meant with having something in common," I stammered.

"Huh. Guess we do."

"So you don't actually do all that shit everyone says you do?" I offered carefully.

Torres hummed. "It depends. Wouldn't say I'm a saint or anything, but it's not all true."

"Ever been to church?"

"Sure."

"Ever gamble in there?"

"Uh-huh."

"Ever destroy mailboxes with a baseball bat?" 

"My plans for the weekend. It's a tradition at this point."

"Ever kick a dog?"

"No."

"Good." He raised a brow at me and I shrugged. "I like dogs," I explained.

"So if I had kicked a dog, that would have been the dealbreaker?" he asked.

"I'm still trying to figure out what the deal is, to be honest," I admitted.

He smirked. "A business arrangement, basically. I'd love to be friends too, but I'm not pushy. This is probably really confusing to you right now. So… I know you've heard all these things. The source of the vast majority of these rumors is actually yours truly. Where I'm from, life's a bit hard and I was in a bad spot from the start. Me and my buddies needed money, like, desperately. The only way to get that was by stealing and scamming. 

See, in Foul, you can't just get a job or something. Jobs aren't even a thing, really. And going over to one of the other towns for one isn't an option either. I don't know if they can *smell* where we're from but not a chance. But I don't really wanna hurt anyone either. Not really a violent guy. Sure, I kinda enjoy trashing stuff but that's that. So I just kinda had to make some things up, you know? Needed to get people to be scared without actually going all the way."

"So this whole abduction-thing is just one big scam?" I stared at him in disbelief.

"Pretty much. I talk to the people I take along, I explain everything to them and then they'll help me by reinforcing all those rumors about me when I drop them off in their hometown again. And sure, I go around and do some nasty shit myself but that's all part of the bigger picture. My last contact in Raw died recently, so… lucky you."

I dropped back into my seat. "Woah," I muttered. "That's kinda genius, not gonna lie."

"It is, isn't it?" Leslie looked a little proud. 

"Wait, you said something about a place named Foul just now, right? What's that about?"

"Oh, you don't know? Well, shouldn't be too surprising, I guess. Not too many people living in that craphole. Foul is where I'm from. It's not like a whole town or anything, more of a trailer park. But it's also where we're headed so you'll see it in a bit." 

Foul was located a few miles offsides from the road connecting Raw and Pure, pretty much right in between the two towns. Once I set foot out of Leslie's car and looked around the small village, his claims began to make even more sense. Foul was really living up to its name. Not only was it dangerously close to the mountains, there was also absolutely *nothing* else around. There were hardly any trees either, just dry, desolate prairie underneath the mercilessly scorching sun. They had a little town sign that curtly read, "Foul" with the addition of "go fuck yourself" which someone had apparently scribbled underneath in black marker.

Leslie Torres chuckled awkwardly. "People here are a tad rude sometimes, don't mind it."

The three people who had been following close behind us, the ones Leslie had come into the bar with, were getting out of their respective cars as well now. Apparently, Mr Torres was very picky with who he gave rides to–his passenger seat was reserved for those "friends" of his he made in the outside towns. Following them into Foul, I noticed that it didn't consist of any houses in the conventional sense. Most of the homes that made up the small, rudimentary village were simple trailers, sturdy tents and shacks of all sizes. Some were pretty far apart from one another while others were so close it looked like they were trying to push each other over. It was like you could see the friend groups the residents lived in just by these differences alone. 

I kept looking around for any kind of walls or fences separating the trailer park from the mountains but couldn't seem to find anything of the sort. Foul was lying utterly exposed, a vulnerable little thing for the threats of the wilderness to take. Leslie led us into the compound's center where I found a small well surrounded by more huts and tents. 

"The closer you are to the middle, the better," he explained. "For one, this thing–" he pointed at the well "–is basically the only source of water around. Also, the things from the mountains come by almost every night so of course, those who live out in the back are screwed. They have to go inside as soon as it gets dark and just hope they don't get aggressive."

There was a larger white trailer almost right next to the well. In front of it was a makeshift fireplace with a couple of camping chairs placed around it. Leslie plopped down on one and gestured for me to do the same. "Is this where you live?" I asked, nodding at the trailer once all of us had situated ourselves.

"Yes. Nice, isn't it?"

"Not really," I replied, only to bite my tongue and hurriedly add, "...my taste."

Leslie laughed. "I get it, it's cool. By the way, you might be wondering why these guys here are following us. They're, like, my best friends ever."

"So long as we do what he says," the redheaded woman remarked with a grin. 

"Oh, grow up," Leslie said wearily and she let out a throaty giggle. 

"I'm Mars. Been with Leslie for six years now. Ever since he first came around. Same for these two though, we kind of found ourselves pretty quickly." Mars gave me a wide smile. "Glad Leslie finally picked up a girl for once. Was starting to get lonely."

The man next to her, a tall, almost lanky tan guy with dark hair cleared his throat. "I'm Rocco. You should check on your brother when we get you home, I was a bit rough on him, I think. Sorry, really didn't mean no harm."

"Sandy, nice to meet you," the fourth one, a blond bearded man introduced himself, offering a slightly awkward, crooked grin. 

"So, uh… how did you all get together?" I inquired.

"I woke up around six years ago. Not in front of any place in particular, just right by the town sign. I was in a lot of pain and I couldn't stop screaming but nobody… nobody really answered. I was just lying there, writhing, until Mars drove up out front. She was the one to take me in." Leslie quietly looked up at her and she smiled softly in reminiscence. 

"I was born here," she added. "Well, not exactly born, more like dumped. My grandfather was some kind of preacher in Pure and my mom got pregnant as a teen so he brought her out here."

I frowned, feeling a sting of sympathy. Life in Foul didn't seem particularly appealing or safe, especially not for a young mother. "Does she still live around here?" I asked.

Mars shook her head, a hint of grief washing over her face. "Eight years ago, she got really sick and… she didn't make it."

"I'm sorry, I didn't–" I began, but she interrupted me. "It's okay. Stuff like that happens all the time here. You gotta watch out for yourself around these parts. There's no one nearby to help if you're on your own, and when you're sick, there won't be anyone who'd know what to do either."

"And you two?" I looked over to Rocco and Sandy.

"We woke up here too, but that was long before Leslie. When Mars picked him up, we had already been friends so when he took over, we just kinda went along," Sandy explained.

"Took over?" I repeated.

Leslie grinned. "Yeah, not to blow my own horn or anything but I'm pretty good at getting us through. Also, I'm great with guns. If you put a shot glass on your head and stand over there, I can shoot it off without hitting you; wanna see?"

"No thanks," I replied with a nervous smile.

We sat and talked for another while during which Leslie explained to me some more about him and the others. Apparently, they had spent the years during which we in Raw hadn't heard from them terrorizing Pure. What had led to his sudden return to us he didn't know–he said it must have simply been the wish for a change of scenery. Once it had started to get a little dark outside, I was getting a bit eager to go home. Pitching this idea to Leslie however brought no results.

"Too late. Sorry, but you're gonna have to stay over. If one of us drives you back now, that means we'll have to walk around here in the dark and the things from the mountains will almost certainly be around then. We dump whatever food we can spare on the outskirts every day, but it's never really enough." He sighed and looked up at the night sky. "You can sleep in the trailer," he suggested. "You'd probably be more comfortable around Mars but her hut barely fits herself and you don't wanna sleep on your own on your first night here so… yeah."

I shrugged. Having someone this confident in his shooting around was more reassuring to me anyways. Leslie's trailer wasn't exactly clean or spacious, but he generously let me sleep in his bed ("I'm nothing if I'm not a gentleman") while he himself curled up with a blanket in a corner between two cupboards. I shot Siobhan a quick text, telling her I'd be home the following day, carefully avoiding any indications as to where I was and how I was doing. I hated to make her worry but I didn't want to ruin Leslie's career. Besides, he wasn't the kind of guy I'd like to have as my enemy. Trying to ignore the strong smell of my surroundings, I shut my eyes and forced myself to relax in an attempt to fall asleep. 

I must have dozed off at some point, seeing as I was startled awake by a metallic clanking noise coming from outside. I sat up in bed to find Leslie standing upright next to it, peering out the trailer's window. Noticing me turning around, he gave a little "shhh!" before motioning for me to join him.

"It knocked over a trash can outside," he whispered, resting his fingertip against the glass. 

"It?"

He hummed. "They're here. Come, have a look."

I quietly rose to my feet and peeled aside the thin curtains on my side of the window. Looking out over the abandoned fireplace and the well outside, I spotted Mars' face in the window of the small hut across from us. She too was peeking outside and even in the darkness, I thought I could see how nervous she was. Leslie waved at her and she gave him a curt nod. 

"There's Rocco over there," Leslie uttered, and I followed his pointing finger to another shed close to the trailer. I found that his friend was standing behind his window as well, face pressed up to the glass. But he didn't seem to have noticed us at all and was looking into another direction entirely. It was only when it rounded the corner that it came into our sight as well. My breath caught in my throat and my heart sank. Despite having encountered the mountain dwellers on multiple occasions, the fear I feel everytime I see one remains unchanged.

I hadn't seen anything like it before. All my life, I had thought the things from the mountains all looked the same, but this one… it was off. It did bear some resemblance with the giant, malformed animals of prey I knew from around Raw though. Calling it human-looking would be a far stretch, and yet, with the way it lumbered across the sandy ground, it seemed almost a bit uncomfortable on four legs. Once it had reached the fireplace, it rose onto its hind legs, stretching out its body to sniff the air. It was enormous. It reminded me of a large, hairless bear, even though I couldn't make out much of its head or face. 

I held my breath. The creature circled the well, only to disappear between two trailers on the other side. I let go of a relieved sigh and plopped down onto the bed. "They come around every night, you say?" I asked quietly. 

Leslie nodded, not turning away from the window. "That was just one. It's not alone."

I immediately got back up to look outside. He was right. I caught a sliver of pale skin sweep by somewhere ahead of us. Whatever these creatures were, they were on the prowl. Suddenly, Leslie winced. I heard him curse under his breath only for him to proceed to rush towards the door. 

"What are you doing?" I breathed.

"There's a cat out there," he simply hissed, only to then storm outside and return seconds later, breathing heavily, a bundle of brown and black fur in his arms. He locked the door behind himself and sitting the kitten down on the floor. Then he sneezed. "Bit allergic," he muttered, scratching his nose. "Seen this one before, probably belongs to one of the kids. Damn brats keep letting their pets walk around like nothing's gonna happen. Should have left it out there to get mangled as a little learning experience."

He went on and on about how pissed some of the younger residents of Foul were getting him. I didn't listen too attentively, I merely sat and played with the cat. Come morning, Leslie drove me home, dropping me off outside of my parents' house just early enough for nobody inside to be awake yet. When Siobhan got up and went outside, she found me sitting on the porch with a vacant look in my eyes. She started crying, hugged and kissed me over and over again. I can hardly put into words how much I hated to pretend something bad had happened to me. When she asked me to go to the doctor with her, I firmly refused.

And whenever she and the others would ask me what exactly had happened after Vasily had left me alone with Torres and his friends, I would always answer with what he'd told me to say.

"I don't want to talk about it."

Four years have gone by since then and Leslie and I have been hanging out ever since. Sure, we don't do it in public, and not only when he's "officially" in town as well. I'm very careful with these details about him too and the only reason I'm comfortable sharing it on here is because hardly anyone in Raw and Pure too for that matter has the means of accessing the internet. More so, the chance of anybody finding my account is extremely slim and I actually got Leslie's permission for this so if he says it's alright, it probably is. He's actually been around Pure a lot lately, but he gave me a call the other day saying he and the others would drop by Raw again very soon. I can’t wait to catch up.

“There it is” I quietly said as I pull the book of anthology horror from the horror section. I liked going to the library a lot of times, mostly because it’s a way I can feel safe and away from my classmates who like to push me around. But also because of the nice librarian Ms Whistley.

Ms Whitstley was a gentle and kind old woman that loved making small talk in the library. She would always try to engage in conversation and would always respect someone’s boundaries if they didn’t want to talk.

Since I was the only person who still came to the library, she loved my company. Me and Ms Whitstley would always gossip about different students or faculty members, as long as we were quiet about it of course.

However today was different, we were discussing about what we did last weekend until we heard the principal make an announcement over the P.A.

***“Lockdown. Code Red. I repeat; Locdown. Code Red. Students and faculty members, please get to a classroom”***

My heart skipped a beat. Code red. That was the sign that there was an armed intruder in the school, or even worse, several. Immediately Ms Whitstley went to the library door and locked it with the key. With a little bit of panic in her voice she told me to hide and pointed to hide under a table that fitted my size.

I quickly ran and crouched under the table. This table was one of those in which you could only see the lower half of someone, but I didn’t care, as long as me and Ms Whitstley found somewhere to hide, I could feel relieved.

About 10 minutes have passed and I heard nothing so far. Until I suddenly heard screaming outside of the library, students were screaming left and right as I heard bones breaking, blood splattering and people screaming for help, or for mercy. 

But what really made my heart drop was hearing the roars. Those roars did not sound human at all. “What the hell is happening out there?!” I thought as the chaos continued outside of the library. I prayed to god that whatever was killing everyone outside of the library didn’t break in and come after me or Ms Whitstley.

I was dead wrong. As soon as I finished my prayer there was a bang sound coming from the library doors. I covered my mouth, muffling my breathing. Yet the banging continued, it became louder and louder. Until a loud slam came and the door went flying! Shattering into dozens of tiny splinters in a matter of seconds.

That’s when I took a look at what the “intruder” was. Or, it’s feet to be frank. It’s own feet was entirely covered in shadows, and the nails were replaced with giant talons. I silenced my breathing as it walked past my table, and inspected the library.

Suddenly I noticed the feet were walking back to my current location. The table. Sweat poured down my face like a fountain, my heart started beating at a fast pace. I muffled my breathing and prayed to god that it wouldn’t find out where I was. But it didn’t leave.

I quietly cried, begging for help in my mind. At that very moment, I heard something, a whack of a broom. I heard a voice saying “Get away from her!” as the whacking continued.

I looked up out of the table and saw that it was Ms Whitstley! She was attacking whatever the hell that was, she screamed at me to run and get out and escape, and I immediately turned. Her words were vaguely in my mind

**“Diana, you can live, I promise you!”**

Tears flowed down my face as I rushed out of library and down the hallways as Ms Whitstley screams of pain and sorrow echoed within the hallways. I didn’t look back.

I made sure not to even for a split second. Because if I even stopped to go see if Ms Whitstley was alright, I would be long gone at this point.

I’m 18 and about to move out for college this fall. I live with my Mom and Dad and two younger brothers. When I was about 5, my parents decided to get me a dog. There was this 5 year old golden retriever, Amelia. She was beautiful and had kind, loving eyes. So I got to walk her around on the leash and it was inist love. 

Amelia was there for every single one of us. Some of the fondest memories I have are taking her to the dog park by our house with my little brothers. She was there all through Elementary and most of middle school. During the summer we would go to our cousins house who owned a farm. We would let her off leash and go run around. One summer, when I was going into 8th grade. She never came back.

I looked everywhere for her, we all did. My brothers and I spent hours looking for Amelia everyday. We were searching the woods behind the house and I found her.
Well her head.It was just her skull, nothing else. Nothing expect those beautiful kind eyes staring right back at me. I went right back to the house. Everyone at dinner was asking me what was wrong. I didn’t say anything. What do you say? I found her skull with perfectly untouched eyes in her head in the woods.

So I kept my mouth shut. But I didn’t sleep for days. I couldn’t everytime I closed them. She was there and those eyes. They now haunt me.  I convinced my parents to take us home early. I never went back again. I always found excuses. 

But this was my last summer here so I figured I could go visit for a couple days. On the day I got there when we were all watching tv. I heard whining at the door. My aunt and uncle never got any inside dogs. My little brother Austin went to open it. Standing there for all of us to see was Amelia. She has the same scar, the same limp in her walk. Everyone's eyes went wide. 

No one said anything. Then my youngest brother and cousins broke down crying. The jumped up and hug her. She looked older, but not like a dog on death's doorstep. Which she should be since she is 18 years old. She was wagging her tail and licking there faces. Everyone got up and started loving on her.  

I stayed seated. Everything about her was correct expect for her eyes. They were darker, colder. She looked at me over Uncle John’s shoulder and this dog seemed to smirk at me. 

“Are you sure this is Amelia?” The dog seemed to glower at me while everyone else looked shocked.

Mom spoke up, “Of course, I mean look at her,” she pointed at her. The dog decided to roll on her back. Letting everyone give her bellyrubs. I didn’t though. When we got back to watching the movie, she sat down right beside me on the couch. I didn’t touch her, but I always kept an eye on her. When the movie was over, I went to my room and took a shower. 

She tried to follow me into the bedroom but I shut the door. When I got out she was laying on my bed. Watching me with those cold eyes. They seemed evil. I decided to go get a drink downstairs. I closed the door behind me. Trapping her in the room.

But after I had gotten my glass of water she was right behind me. My heart leapt up into my throat. I ran and got my keys. Mom was still up and I told her I was heading home. She asked why and I told her that the dog wasn’t Amelia. That I found her head in the woods all those years ago. She brushed me off as being paranoid and finding a wild animal skull. I rushed home and locked all the door. I couldn’t handle being there. That dog was evil.

In the morning, Dad texted me telling me she is gone again. 

That was my first time coming back over there for about 5 years and will definitely be the last.

I was recently hired as a security guard at a my old school. I had very fond memories of my teen years here so I was excited to hear I managed to get the job. It was very high paying for the position but I thought that was just because it was a night role in a very large school.

I didn’t get an induction or training, instead I got a note. It read: 
Hello, Thank you for taking this position. You are the only night guard we have currently but not much goes on so do not worry. Occasionally some troublemakers break into the school but due to the size of the school you won’t run into them so don’t bother trying. You have access to all the cameras if in need. And remember your safety takes priority. Have fun and be careful.

This made me feel even better that this was indeed free money. All I had to do was keep to myself.

In my first few nights nothing happened i spent most my time watching YouTube on the computer provided with some interruptions that turned out to only be the schools raccoon problem. On my one week anniversary was when I first heard the kids I decided to listen to the note and tried to filter out their giggles as I heard things get moved around. This only ever happened once or twice a month until I was about 8 months into this job.

It was around September time were the break ins became more frequent with them starting off to once a week but by the start of October it was every day without fail. So I decided to work for my money and try to find the hooligans.

It was around 2:00 when I heard the frequent crash of a door to signal they had arrived, so i armed myself with a taser and a flashlight. I heard they entered the northern end around the tech rooms. I made my way over there making as little noise as possible so I could catch them in the act. When I got close I heard muffled laughter and what seemed to be typing. I found the classroom with the door open, I counted to three and shone the flashlight where they were. But no one was there. I searched the class but no luck. They must of escaped.

I made my way back to my office confused joking to myself that I must of been chasing a ghost. On my way back I heard scuttling from above, that’s when I remembered about the vent system that made its way around the school. I ran back to the room to see the cover off the wall and screws on the ground. I followed the noises until it brought me to the English corridor. The noises finally stopped and I looked up to the vent, I scanned for any sign of the intruders. I looked at the nearest air duct to see a face, it was staring at me with a twisted smile. Everything about this being told me to run, it’s face was too round, it was too pale, it’s eyes were different colors with its pupils not dilating to the flashlight, and to top it off it’s mouth seemed to be sown shut.

So I listened to my brain and ran back to my office, I heard distant singing from what sounded like multiple of those creatures. The halls seemed to go on longer then usual with my sense of direction seeming to be thrown off. I heard clatters of doors being slammed open. The roof was seeming to close in on me. I made it to my office and called the police. I told them in a hurry what was going on. I finished up and gave them the address but instead the operator on the line started cutting out until I heard my own voice talking to them saying it was a prank and that I was sorry. I desperately screamed down the phone that it wasn’t, but they couldn’t hear me. I got told off by the operator and then promptly hung up on.

That was my hope for help gone. I had to escape on my own. I heard them approach the door and the handle rattle. The lock luckily held so I heard them retreat. I decided it was my time to run, I now knew help was impossible so I got out the map and found the nearest emergency exit it was just two hallways away, the only problem was I didn’t know where those creatures were lurking. I breathed in and said my prayers as I opened the door.

I saw one on the right leap out and start to chase me, I kept on going and saw my first turn coming upon. I flew round the corner and turned behind myself to see the walls closing together behind me so I turned back around to see the same thing happening, I was trapped. I turned to see 5 of the monsters I described earlier floating outside the window performing what looked like a ritual. They turned to me muttering some sort of incantation and I felt my soul leaving my body as if someone had attached a fishing line to it. So I was down to my last hope. I was three floors up, walls closing in, and soul leaving my body. I turned to the double glazed glass, dropped my shoulder and ran full force at it.  I felt the glass go deep inside my shoulder as the adrenaline rushed through my body. I looked down to see nothing but a patch of grass below me. I stuck my legs out and felt every bone in my body crack as I hit the floor. My scream luckily alerted a nearby neighbor as I heard the ambulance sirens whilst I was phasing in and out of conscious. I looked up to see the 5 demons sink back into the walls of the school whilst laughing as if I’m not the last victim they are going to torment. But I am almost certain I will be the last one who lived to tell the tale.

I woke up with my alarm blaring on the nightstand. Drool was dried on my cheek, my eyes crusty. I sat up and pinched my leg. When I felt the subtle pain, I sighed. I was out of the dream world. No bad dreams. In fact, no dreams at all. The night was vast and quiet, a frozen lake.

I got out of bed and stretched my arms. Outside, spring had moved further away—the morning was dark and cold, wind rushing off the hills.

I looked at the date on my alarm. Sweat dripped down my neck.

March 31st.

The day was finally here.

I got dressed in a denim skirt and a *Joy Division* t-shirt Preston gave me. As I walked downstairs, I saw Mom in the kitchen. There was a bowl of oatmeal on the counter next to a glass of water. I dropped my backpack and sat in front of the lackluster meal. Mom turned and looked at me, then went back to the dishes. Her expression didn’t offer anything.

“Thanks for breakfast,” I said.

“Sure,” she said.

I took a bite. There was no cinnamon, or extra syrup, or scattered raisins. It was plain oatmeal and boiled tap water.

“It’s good,” I said.

Mom dropped a plate into the sink. I heard it break on impact. She gripped her hands into fists, then spread her fingers. She stayed frozen like that for a moment.

“Do you need help?” I asked.

Mom didn’t respond. She ran her hands through her hair then went back to washing dishes.

“Mom?”

“What?” She asked, still looking in the sink.

“Do you need help?” I asked again.

Mom rested her arms on the edge of the sink. She took a deep breath, like she had just finished a race. I could also see drops of blood running down her fingers.

“Sometimes dishes break,” she said.

The water was still running, steam clouding the window. I was only halfway through my oatmeal, but I wasn’t hungry anymore.

“I’m going to school,” I said, standing up.

“I know it was wrong to tell you like that,” she said, “I’m just really upset about what you did.”

I threw my bag on my back and walked toward the door.

“Yeah,” I said. “Lying about cancer is a new low. Even for you.”

“It’s not…”

“I’ll be home after school,” I said, opening the door. “Don’t develop any missing limbs while I’m gone.”

And, with that, I was out the door. The cold air hit me right away. I was severely underdressed, my springtime optimism catching up to me. It was still winter jacket weather. But, I wasn’t going back inside. I would survive. Like so many days in my life, I just had to get through this one.

Preston was waiting for me on the steps of Twin Pines High. Behind him, the massive, half-empty school hung over like a cliff face, the gargoyles gazing down on us. The school was built in the early 20th century when Twin Pines was a promising coal mining town. It was three stories tall, full of statues and gothic spires. The figures were mostly coal miners, frozen men swinging hammers or stepping into flaming caves. The architects threw in the occasional gothic beast or random saint for good measure. It was a building built for a town of prestige. But, it ended up as a strange reminder that the past wrongfully predicted the future. That was one of the only ways I could relate to Twin Pines. We both ended up in places we never expected.

“Hey,” Preston said.

He stood up and walked toward me, wrapping me in a hug. I kept my arms at my side.

“Is this a *Lifetime* movie?” I asked, pushing him back. I brought my voice down, mocking him. “*Hey*…”

“Easy there,” he said. “You don’t have to be mean. I know this is a lot for you. Between the anniversary and what happened last night, I…”

“Stop. Ew.” I said, waving my hands in front of me, “I…look. I appreciate it. I really do. But it’s, like, I’m good, okay? I just want to get through this day.”

Preston nodded. For a moment, his sad boy demeanor shifted. I thought he was going to yell at me, but he didn’t. He took a breath, then smiled.

“You know,” he said. “We both could have been in a lot of trouble last night.”

I tilted my head to the side.

“Oh yeah?”

“Yeah,” he said. “It’s not the Emma Show.”

My jaw dropped a little. Of all days to accuse *me* of being dramatic, he picked the one day I was *allowed* to be dramatic. One year ago, I was *so* dramatic that I decided to remove myself from the planet.

“I know it’s not the Emma Show,” I said. “But, if it was, this would probably be the episode where the *asshole* best friend says something vaguely *asshole-ish*. What do you think?”

Preston didn’t respond. Behind me, I heard the hum of dark clouds, of a distant storm. It was coming over the hills, ready to remind our little, cold-weather town that winter was always a moment away.

“*You* agreed to do what we did last night, and *I* am the one facing all the consequences,” I said. “If it had gone according to plan and we stopped Marjorie, you would be bragging about how *we* saved Twin Pines. So, explain to me how the math works on this? Because we failed, *you* were some victim in all of this?”

The bell rang. One minute until class started. I rolled my eyes and walked passed Preston. He didn’t stop me. He just stood there, his arms crossed and lips pouty.

“Good morning,” one of the teachers said to me. She was standing at the giant doors of the entrance, her smile tired and obligatory. I waved back, doing my best normal kid cosplay.

But, I only got a few steps in before the rage came back. I turned around and walked back outside. Preston was still standing there, looking just as dumb and sad.

“Stop with that face,” I said. “You always try to make me look like some string-pulling witch. I never asked for your help. I never…”

But, before I could finish, I noticed something. Far behind Preston, something was drifting into the sky. It spiraled up into the grey, twisting like a baby tornado. It must have been a half-mile back, right in the center of my neighborhood. In fact, I knew exactly where it was coming from.

“Look,” I said, pointing behind him.

Preston didn’t look. He kept his focus on me.

“Maybe you’re right,” he said, walking passed me. “Maybe you don’t need my help.”

And, like that, Preston was gone. He stepped into the crowd of students and became just another Twin Piner.

But, I couldn’t join them.

My eyes were fixed on the line of smoke.

And, the longer I looked, the closer it came. It glided toward me like a water snake.

I ran inside and pushed through the crowd.

“Wait! Preston!” I yelled, shoving and sliding between bodies. Some students moved to the side, but most didn’t. After my hospital stay last Fall, I developed a brief fame at Twin Pines. But, by now, it was mostly gone. Me screaming for my other loser friend was not a cause for alarm.

When the final bell rang, students scattered toward their classrooms. Within a few seconds, the hallway was empty.

I knew Preston’s homeroom. I could go there and make my case. But, I needed a plan. Bursting into a random classroom and yelling about Marjorie’s smoke monster wasn’t a great first option.

I slammed my back against a locker. The sound echoed down the hall, but no one came to ask if I was alright. Late students sprinted past. A few teachers stared at me, then shut their doors.

When the morning announcements came on, I slid down the locker and sat on the ground. The principal, an aged-out townie with no children and a penchant for cheesy jokes, declared “Happy April Fools Eve”.

I dropped my head against the metal door behind me.

Then, as if on cue, the school’s front door swung open. A familiar face, or should I say *faces*, emerged.

Freddy the Fibber and his Mom walked down the hallway right toward me. She had her arm wrapped around him, guiding him like an injured lamb. She had those wild mother eyes, the kind I’d seen on my own mom before. They were darting from wall-to-wall, anticipating danger at every turn. When she saw me, she looked angry. Then, she shook her head, and a bizarre smile emerged.

“Hi dear,” she said. “Can you point me in the direction of the principal’s office?”

Freddy kept his eyes to the ground, his cheeks red. I pointed to the door at the end of the hall.

“Last door on the left,” I said.

“Thanks,” she said. She walked passed me, pulling Freddy along. But, after a few steps, he planted his feet.

“Can I wait out here?” He asked.

His Mom looked at me, and then back at him. She nodded, then wrapped him in a hug.

“Don’t move a muscle,” she said. “Got it?”

“Got it,” Freddy said.

And, just like that, we were alone. When she reached the principal’s office, she turned the knob and burst inside, calling out for help right away.

When the door closed behind her, the hallway was quiet again. Neither of us spoke. The only sound came from the crunch of Freddy’s fingers. He was cracking them one at a time, his eyes fixed on the “Say No To Drugs” poster on the wall. I stood up to join him.

“I thought you were at the middle school,” I said, breaking the silence.

“Mom thought high schoolers wouldn’t bully me as much,” he said. “She’s trying to push me ahead.”

I laughed.

“What?” He asked.

“Sorry, but it doesn’t get any better,” I said. “Actually, bullies get better with age. They’re so good, sometimes they get the teachers to join in.”

Freddy nodded. He was biting his fingertips now.

“Maybe college will be better,” he said.

From the principal’s office, I heard his Mom yell. She was shouting about “top of his class” and “unique circumstances”. Judging by the tone of her voice, I think she was losing the argument.

I looked back at Freddy. He kept his eyes on anything but mine.

“I don’t believe what people say,” I said.

“Sorry?”

Finally, he turned to look at me, moving a little close for comfort. I could see the dark bags under his eyes.

“The rumors,” I said. “I don’t believe them.”

“Cool,” he said.

Even with his shoulders slouched, he still towered over me, his chest twice as wide as mine. It looked like he had aged ten years since *the other place*.

“Cool?” I asked.

His breathing sped up. I couldn’t tell if he was going to attack me or cry. His lip was quivering, his hands balled into fists. His Mom was still yelling through the closed door. Each time she did, I could see it affect him, his posture shrinking with each scream.

Gone was the brave boy I’d once known, the defender of the younger kids, the leader of the lost.

This Freddy was different, broken.

“Do you remember me?” I asked.

Freddy, without pause, shook his head.

“No,” he said. “But I’m not allowed to say that, right? I don’t have the benefit of a coma.”

“I’m sorry…what?”

Freddy turned away, facing the locker.

“Everyone knows exactly where you were,” he said. “But me? No. I’m a mystery. I’m the kid who tried to kill *you*. They could say I killed John F. Kennedy and people would believe it.”

I put my hand on his shoulder. He shook me off.

“Don’t touch me,” he said.

“I don’t believe any of that,” I said. “I saw you there, at the carnival. I remember you.”

“Well, add it to the conspiracies,” he said. “But, in the meantime, the best thing you can do is leave me alone. Thanks.”

He walked a little further down the hall. I didn’t follow him.

“Fine,” I said. “I tried.”

Freddy stopped and slammed his forehead into a locker. The crash echoed down the hall.

“Yo, chill.” I said. “I know you hate my guts, but don’t hurt yourself. There’s plenty of other people doing that for us.”

He turned to look at me, his eyes blinking fast.

“What does that mean?” He asked.

I paused for a moment. From the down the hall, I heard Freddy’s Mom call the secretary a choice word. Freddy flinched. I took a step closer.

“She’s back,” I said.

“She who?”

“You know,” I said. “But, it’s not like it was. She’s different. There was this smoke and…”

Freddy laughed.

“And they call *me* the crazy one,” he said.

“I’m serious,” I said. “I think it’s going to be bad. If she’s airborne like this, the whole town could get trapped where we were.”

“Oh no,” he said. “How horrible.”

Freddy tried to laugh again, but he lost energy halfway through. A strange smile remained.

“I hope she drags the whole town down there,” he said. “I’d rather be *right* than a freak. Besides, it’s what they deserve. I tried to tell them.”

“But…”

I couldn’t finish. His Mom walked out of the office and rushed by us, grabbing Freddy’s shirt as she did. He dragged behind her, struggling to find his footing.

“Looks like you’re getting homeschooled,” she said.

“Hold on,” I said, but they didn’t hear me. Or, at least they acted like they didn’t.

And, with that, Freddy and his Mom walked down the hall, pushed passed the front doors, and stepped outside.

I stood in the hallway for a moment, wondering what to do next. But, before I could make up my mind, my path was clear.

It was a scream.

A blood-curdling scream.

It pressed against the school doors like a swarm of cicadas.

I pushed the doors open and ran outside. The first thing I saw was the smoke—it hung over the front steps, hovering in pockets of fog. Freddy’s Mom was standing on the edge of it, looking down the stairs. She was doubled over, gripping her hair.

“Help! Please! Someone!”

I lifted my shirt collar over my mouth and ran to her. Below, Freddy was halfway down the stairs, his body twisted in a heap. His eyes were half-open, staring up at us. He wasn’t totally gone yet. He was mouthing something.

His Mom looked at me.

“Get help,” she said, then ran down the steps. She dropped next to him and lifted his head into her lap. Blood dripped off his hair. It instantly covered her hand.

Around us, the smoke pulsed like a jellyfish, it’s purple tinge flaring with the sound of distant thunder. I tried to hold my breath as much as I could, but I only made it a few seconds. When I inhaled, the stairs bent, rippling like small waves.

“It’s not safe!” I yelled down to her. “We need to go inside.”

“Go get help,” she said again.

“It’s the smoke,” I said. “You need to…”

“I’m not leaving him again,” she said. “Go. Please.”

She leaned down and kissed Freddy on the forehead, whispering something I couldn’t hear. As she held him, I watched his eyes slowly close, his mouth still moving. She hyperventilated as she looked down at him.

“No no no,” she cried.

I kept studying his mouth. He was repeating the same three words, over and over again.

*Please. Not. Here.*

Then, his mouth stopped moving. As it did, Freddy’s Mom let out a gasp. Then, seconds later, her head fell forward. She collapsed into him.

Behind me, the school’s ancient bell rung out. I heard doors open and students scramble toward one another. They had two minutes to make it to their next class.

I looked back at Freddy and his Mom, but they were hard to see in the smoke. It was thicker now, crawling toward me. Within a moment, it had surrounded me on all sides. My only escape was inside.

I pushed open the doors and ran in. As the bodies pushed into bodies and the conversations roared as one, I gathered the little breath I had and screamed.

“Run!!!”

No one moved.

In fact, most people turned at me and laughed.

*Yoooo, coma girls having a flashback.*

*Napalm! Napalm! Look out!*

*PTSD! Duck in your foxholes!*

Then, seconds later, they forgot about me all together. Kids went back to their conversations, rolled their eyes, convulsed with laughter, shoved and kissed and spat insults at one another. They didn’t notice the smoke as it glided through the cracks of the door behind me. They didn’t scream as it bunched and formed into little grey clouds, positioned like a front line of soldiers. They didn’t cry as it rose to the ceiling and became a wave.

But, as I ran through the crowd, I heard the first calls of danger.

“Yo! Fire!” One of the jocks yelled.

Students turned to look. Some of them screamed. Some laughed. But, despite it all, no one moved. I was still pushing against the dense crowd.

“Preston!” I yelled. “Where are you?”

Behind me, I heard a girl scream.

“He passed out!”

Then, another.

“Call the nurse!”

I turned to look. The crowd was dropping one by one. Students collapsed into one another, forming a human blockade by the entrance. Within a few seconds, the joking crowd turned half-serious, and then deadly serious. As the smoke moved from body to body, it reformed into tiny fingers and shoved itself into nostrils. Students convulsed as the fog leaked out their mouths. Eyes rolled back. Girls screamed. Boys yelled.

Then, the pushing started.

I lost my footing right away. As I fell into the group of girls behind me, the boys in front of me rammed toward us with all their might. My feet flew over my head. My back slammed into the ground. The girls cried out, yelling for people to stop. But, more bodies piled on top of us. Some of them were violent. The rest were unconscious.

A hand reached down and yanked me back up. My feet weren’t on the ground, but I was moving, all of us a fleshy wave heading toward the exit by the gym.

*Push!*

*Help!*

*He’s not breathing!*

*Run!*

The fire alarm blared. A muffled voice rang through the intercom.

“Please make your way to the nearest exit,” the principal said. “This is not a drill. Do you not go to class. Exit the building immediately.”

Ahead of us, students started funneling through the exit. But, as soon as they did, more smoke came through the door. Bodies dropped. Within seconds, the escape was clogged with limbs. The students were piled up like sand bags.

There was nowhere to go.

We were surrounded by smoke.

As it poured in from both exits, the horde stopped moving in a single direction. Students went backwards, forwards, sideways. People screamed, even the teachers. Old men were reduced to babies, punching the lockers with tears in their eyes.

As the sprinklers went off, the kids who managed to climb up to the windows slipped back down. They crashed into the others. The yelling intensified.

*“Please!”*

*“Help me!”*

*“I can’t breathe!”*

*“What’s happening!”*

Teachers tried to revive the passed out students, but it wasn’t long before they joined them.

“Preston!” I yelled. I tried to climb on people’s backs. But, no matter how high I got, I couldn’t find him.

As the smoke came closer, the horde made its way toward the exit by the cafeteria. But, I knew that wouldn’t work. The smoke would be there too.

I turned and ran down the freshman hallway. It was a dead-end but, in the girl’s room, there was a window behind the stall. If I was able to climb up, I might be able to get out.

I sprinted down the empty hallway. Doors were flung open, binders spilled out on the ground. There were a few bodies scattered across the ground—people who tried to run away once they’d been hit. I didn’t stop to help them. I couldn’t. I kept running.

But, when I made it to the door, I heard something. It was a familiar voice, blasting through the intercom. It was deep and muffled, as if the microphone was too weak to capture its magnitude.

“Come out little mouse,” it said. “This world of yours will soon be nothing.”

I pushed against the bathroom door. Something was blocking it. I knocked, but the person wouldn’t budge. I took a step back, ready to throw my body into the door. But, when I did, I noticed something out the corner of my eye.

The hallway seemed to stretch twice as long as normal. As the lights flickered, the smoke marched toward me. And, in front of it, there was the vague shape of a human. I couldn’t make out her features through the fog, but I knew who she was.

She approached in small steps, the smoke billowing out her back. She was taller and skinnier than she had been before. Flesh hung off her bones, flapping in the tornado of smoke and wind. She looked like a house on the brink of collapse. Gone was the Marjorie I first met—the unassuming old woman with her short hair and mean eyes. No. This Marjorie had been stretched atop something else—its skin the aftermath of too many journeys, too many transformations. Her features fit like a poorly made Halloween costume.

“No more games,” she bellowed. “It’s time to come home.”

She walked like a puppet, her legs misstepping ahead of her torso, her balance wavering. All around her, papers and posters and school supplies swarmed about, crashing into lockers. Doors swung open and closed. Ceiling lights exploded as she passed.

“Remember last year? When you tried to visit me?” she asked. “I miss that Emma.”

Fear gripped my muscles.

*Move Emma. Run! Go!*

But, the signals weren’t translating. I stood there, totally dumbfounded. She moved closer, and closer, and closer, until…

Something grabbed my shirt and yanked me toward it. I flew down onto the ground as a door closed behind me. I looked up. [My strange neighbor](https://www.dandeluise.com/books) was gone. Someone else was standing over me.

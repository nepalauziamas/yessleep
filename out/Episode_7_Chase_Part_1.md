&#x200B;

I followed Allan into the part of the UG-Crimson I have never been to before. Hallways here didn’t look like the rest of the facility. Usually, the hallways were modern, clean, and pleasant. These, on the other hand, were dark, cold, and looked like a part of a cramped factory with machines laying all around. There were pipes on the walls and instead of having lamps over the entire ceiling, there were those old-timey lamps that are usually associated with World War 2 bunkers. They left a bit of darkness in between them.  

Allan and I weren’t alone. We were followed by two of his guards. Both of them were carrying rifles. At first, I thought he was going to order them to kill me. I thought he found out that I helped the resistance, but he didn’t. When we got close enough for me to see the end of the hallway, I noticed a huge metal door standing there.  

“Allan, where are you taking me?” I asked.  

“You’ll see,” he answered. “We... our scientists made a discovery,” he stopped and turned around towards me.  

I and the two guards stopped as well. I could see the passion in Allan’s eyes. He was really proud of this achievement. It was the first time he gave someone credit after all.  

“It’s a big one,” he said before turning back around and continuing walking. “But there’s one catch. You need to keep it a secret...” he stopped for a second. “This includes Lilith. You can’t tell her anything you’ll see here.”  

“Noted,” I replied.  

We got to the big metal door quickly. It wasn’t a long walk. Allan knocked on the doors. He turned to the side and there was a camera watching us. He waved at it and after a second, I heard something opening. I turned towards the door thinking it was the doors themselves. In reality, a small panel on the door slid down and revealed some sort of a scanning device attached to the doors. Allan leaned in closer and the device scanned his face. After it was done, he needed to type something in. Before he started, he looked at me. He nodded to the right telling me to look away. I noticed that the guards already turned around and so did the camera. I heard a few beeping noises.  

“Welcome back, Mr. Carter,” a soothing female but clearly computer-generated voice said.  

I heard the doors opening and saw the two guards turning around so I did the same. As soon as I did, I was enamoured with what I saw. There was a large machine in the middle of a huge circular room.  

“Come one,” Allan said telling me to follow him with his hand.  

The machine was at least 20 feet wide and just as tall. But that wasn’t the weirdest part of it. The machine had 6 large see-through containers on the bottom that was the size of an average barrel. Each of them was connected to something below the ground with tubes. There was an open space just in the middle of the machine and I noticed that there was some sort of doors underneath it. They looked like those often depicted on missile silos, but much smaller.  

“You want to see what it does?” Allan asked me with a creepy smile.  

I nodded while looking at the machine. I can’t really describe how it looks other than what I already did. It was such a confusing contraption.  

“Come,” he told me. “I have other things to do. I can’t wait the entire day.”  

He started walking away, but I stayed at the same place and kept looking at the machine. I only noticed that he left after one of the guards reminded me by softly hitting my shoulder and pointing in Allan’s direction.  

“Thank you,” I said before I had a little jog towards Allan.  

“Do you remember when I told you that we were collecting CR-Chupacabra's blood for something big?” he asked.  

“I do. I brought one in after all, didn’t I?” I replied.  

“Do you know how many were brought in?” he asked without giving an answer to my question.  

“I have no idea,” I told him.  

“Twenty-seven,” he said chuckling. “Twenty-seven CR-Chupacabra's. Can you imagine that?” he chuckled once more. “Do you know why we need them?”  

“I remember that it’s something about blood, but I'm not quite sure what.”  

“Well, you see, CR-Chupacabra has a very unusual way of feeding. At first glance, they might seem just like normal vampires. Blood other vampires drink goes to their digestive system immediately. With CR-Chupacabras, it’s much more complicated and confusing,” he said.  

“What are you aiming at?” I asked.  

“You see, instead of what I’ve mentioned, CR-Chupacabras take special elements and proteins from their blood and put them into the blood they drank. The new blood takes the role of the old blood... serving as blood, while the old blood goes into the digestive system,” he said turning his head around to see if I’m listening.  

“Yeah, yeah. That's all so fun and interesting, but why is it important information?” I asked.  

“Just listen to me. I’m getting to it,” he sounded a bit irritated. “The blood they send to their digestive system, their old blood now contains a very unique chemical compound. It doesn’t appear anywhere else except in the digested blood from CR-Chupacabras, he said.  

I noticed that we got to a normal door on the opposite side of the room to the big metal door. Allan opened them and I saw the stairs. We started climbing them and after 2 floors that didn’t lead anywhere, we got to the third floor with was like a command center. There were scientists all over the place as well as some guards. There was thick blackened on the wall opposite the entrance of the room and it was pointed towards the machine. Allan walked up to the glass and stooped right in front of it. I did the same.  

“We brought those CR-Chupacabras to one of the facilities and started feeding them to gather this compound. You may wonder which facility was it, but that’s classified information.”  

“What are you doing with the blood?” I asked.  

“Well, as I said, that compound has some special properties. One of these properties is that when it comes in contact with the nervous system of CR-Velvet outsiders, it completely disables it from sending any signals to the body. Essentially, this allows us to gain complete control of their nervous systems and...”  

“And you can force them to use their abilities however you want.” I finished his sentence.  

He nodded in agreement. I took a look at the machine. This was more than just a discovery. Being able to control a creature that can travel through time and space and possibly even different realities.  

“H... How did you do that?” I asked. “I don’t understand... I... I mean, you made a fucking portal!” I shouted excitedly.  

I just can’t describe the feeling I had at that moment. It was like I was light-headed out of joy and excitement.  

“We can show you a small demonstration,” Allan said.  

“Please,” I said taking a look at him before turning back towards the machine.  

“Turn it on,” Allan told one of the scientists.  

“Yes, sir,” the scientist replied.  

Someone turned on an alarm.  

“The test will start in 60 seconds. Please get away from the machine,” the scientist stated over the intercom.  

I noticed that the transparent containers started to fill up with dark red liquid which I assumed to be digested blood from CR-Chupacabras. The hatch beneath the machine opened. Out of it came a locked-up CR-Velvet outsider. It confused me as to how they managed to hold it down as it had all the properties of a liquid. 

“How did you manage to restrain it?” I asked.  

“When a CR-Velvet outsider comes in contact with the compound in the CR-Chupacabra's digested blood, its skin hardens alongside its nervous system. Its skin stays hardened forever, but its nervous system doesn’t,” he replied. “So, if we want to control it, we need to get that compound into its head once more. For that, we have special needles and drills that can pierce the hardened skin on its head. It is still aware of its surroundings and can feel everything, but it can’t do anything about it.”  

I was surprised by how cruel this was, but then I remembered what it achieved. It was terrible to know that because CR-Velvet outsiders are usually extremely friendly and wouldn’t even defend themselves against their attackers.  

“The test is starting in 5,” the scientist said.  

My heart started to beat faster.  

“4,” he exclaimed.  

With each second, it started to beat faster and faster.  

“3,” roared the intercom.  

Everyone gathered in front of the window and waited for the test to begin.  

“2,” the scientist said while positioning his hand over a red button.  

“1,” he shouted and pressed the button.  

It wasn’t too fast at the beginning. I could see some movements on the bottom of the machine and quickly realized that it was the drills drilling into the CR-Velvet outsider’s head. It looked insanely painful and I just couldn't imagine how painful something like that would be. I noticed that the color of its skin wasn’t as much of a strong velvet. It was quite a bit darker with some brown accents.  

“It’s injecting it with the blood at the moment,” Allan said.  

“I noticed,” I replied. “But don’t you think that it’s a bit inhumane?”  

“I do,” he answered. “But it could save lives of billions and I think it’s a small price to pay.”  

I knew he was lying. Not about this machine being able to save billions, but about caring. He didn’t care about the life of the cryptid. He doesn’t even care about the lives of people. I started to become concerned about how much power this would give him, but at the time, I couldn’t do anything about it. I would be shot there and then by those guards.  

“Pay attention now,” Allan told me while crossing his arms. “This is the fun part.”  

Just above the CR-Velvet outsider, there was a round platform. It was a darker material which I assumed to be some sort of metal with magnetic properties because there was another one of the same size 10 feet above it. I didn’t even notice it before. Both of them were surrounded by a steel ring. When the needles were pulled out of the CR-Velvet outsider’s head, the rings started to spin. At first, it was slow, but after only a few seconds, they reached a much higher velocity. The rings moving were accompanied by the sound of dragging. It got louder as the velocity got higher. The sound was muffled by the thick glass, but it was still loud.  

Suddenly, there was a boom that sounded like thunder and there was a blue flash in between the magnets. Everyone covered their ears and closed their eyes. It was followed by two flashes of lightning each coming from one of the magnets and colliding with each other. It created this weird ball that had a diameter of about afoot. When the flashes of lightning disappeared, it stayed like that for about ten seconds before it started shrinking and becoming darker. The weird thing about it was that the lights started to become weaker and weaker. The ball started to absorb light as it was turning darker and darker. This immediately made me realize what the thing I was looking at was. A black hole.  

It got completely pitch black in the room with the machine. There was still light where we stood. It was due to how light interacts with glass. Part of it passes through it, while the other part reflects back.  

“It doesn’t have much impact on anything else but light,” Allan said.  

Suddenly out of nowhere, there was a burst of light. The contrast was so big that it took me a minute to adapt to the light once more. When I did, I turned towards the machine and saw... the portal. It looked like blue liquid, but it gradually got darker closer to the middle.  

“Ready for a visual?” Allan asked the main scientist.  

“Yes, sir,” he replied.  

Two other scientists were tasked with bringing it to the portal. Both of them walked up to the door. One of them picked up a camera, while the other one picked up something resembling a rover.  

“Wh... What?” I spoke. “I... I mean how?”  

“I won’t answer your questions,” Allan replied. “No one will. You don’t need to know why, how, or when, but that it exists,” he looked me in the eyes. “Prepare the screen,” he told the main scientist.  

The scientist pressed a button and a large screen appeared on the window in front of Allan. At first, it was black, but then the camera was turned on. It showed that the two scientists already assembled the rover and were being lifted to be at the same height as the magnetic platform. I looked through the window and noticed that both of them were wearing hazmat suits. It was due to the fact that the environment on the other side can be dangerous and we have no way of finding out if it is other than by going to the other side.  

The two scientists stepped onto the platform and put the rover onto the platform. They turned towards the window and lifted their thumbs up at the same exact time. They started to get off of the platform while someone started to take control of the rover. They commanded it to go through the portal. While going through it, there was static on the screen with loud distorted noises. After about half a minute, a picture started to appear on the screen and it took my attention.  

The screen showed... plants? Not really plants though. They seemed like plants and had similar colors, but there was something off about them. They weren’t real plants. What we were looking at, wasn’t Earth, at least not ours. It was a completely different world. We didn’t really know if it was a different planet or a different reality.  

“Is it a new one?” Allan asked the lead scientist.  

“I believe so,” he replied. “I don’t remember seeing that vegetation before. This must be a new one.”  

Allan turned back towards the screen and continued looking at it.  

“That would be all,” he said. “Isn’t it amazing?”  

“It is much more than that,” I answered.  

The rover was driving around on the ground. There were trees all over the place as well, but they were also different from their counterparts on Earth. The color, the shape, and almost everything else was weird. We stayed there looking at the screen for another 20 minutes.  

“Okay, that would be enough,” said Allan. “You should go now. Oh, by the way, do you remember those power outages that lasted for a minute or so?” he asked me. “We were testing this,” he said before I could answer.  

“It was worth it, I guess,” I replied.  

“It was,” he said with a stern and serious voice.  

He turned back to the screen and continued watching it. I started walking towards the door when I heard him call after me.  

“Yes?” I asked turning around.  

“No word about this to anyone else, alright?” he was while still looking at the screen.  

“No sir,” I replied. “You don’t have to worry about it.”  

“Good,” Allan said. “Have a nice day.”  

I was escorted out by one of the guards. We went back into the hallway and when we got far enough, he put a bag over my head and continued telling me where to go and slightly pushing me. I got really irritated and really wanted to punch the shit out of the guy but I managed to keep my cool. After walking for some time, he grabbed my shoulder to stop me.  

“Wait for a second,” he said. “Don’t remove the bag.”  

I could hear something drag on the floor and there was some sort of a click. The man walked up to me and took the bag off of my head. When I could see again, I noticed that we were in the principal’s office. This wasn’t where we came from in the first place. I looked around trying to find where we came from, but couldn’t find anything. We used a different path to get to the room with the machine, but I had a bag on my head while going through that one too. We could have gotten in through the main doors of the office, but I think that it was unlikely. Someone would have asked the guard about the situation, and even if that’s not true, I would have at least heard someone passing by. But I didn’t.  

While I was looking around, the guard tried pushing me by my shoulder, but I expected this time so it didn’t do much.  

“You need to leave,” he said. “Mr. Carter doesn’t want anyone to be here without him.”  

I gave the guard a furious look and left the office. As soon as I did, I could hear people passing through the hallway outside the waiting room so that’s one proof that we used a secret passage. I took in a deep breath and started walking toward my apartment. It didn’t take me long to get to it. As soon as I entered it, I walked up to the couch and laid down on it. It was good to have a bit of rest after a night without sleep. A very intense night considering how that fight with the CR-Mime went. Thinking of it made me remember that it was ‘powered up’ by the CR-Phantom. I also remembered that Allan mentioned that they knew that CR-Phantom causes cryptids to change.  

“There was a pattern of those transformed cryptids appearing at the places where CR-Phantom was seen a few days before,” he told me earlier. “We didn’t really want it to be public knowledge. It could lead to chaos.”  

I started to fall asleep when I heard the sound of doors opening.  

“Damien?” I heard Alex say. “When did you come?”  

“What’s up, Alex?” I replied still laying on the couch. “We landed about an hour ago, but Allan wanted to show me something. We had a pretty long conversation,” I said.  

“What about?” Alex asked me.  

“I can’t say,” I replied.  

“Really?” he asked. “You can’t tell your friend?”  

“I can,” I told him. “But I won’t because I mustn't... And you’d tell anything to your resistance friends.”  

“That’s interesting,” he said. “But I also have something that you’d find interesting,” he said lifting up the notebook I took from Donovan, that old hunter that was presumed to be dead.  

“I’ve already gone through the entire notebook and I haven’t found anything,” I told him.  

“Technically, you did,” he chuckled. “But you see, what you thought to be gibberish, Diana could read just fine,” he smirked.  

“What are you talking about?” I asked him while sitting up.  

“Well, apparently, Donovan started to teach himself vampiric,” Alex said. “This is a language that all of the vampires can speak and understand.”  

“How did you find that out?” I asked.  

“That information will go alongside the information about what is written with it,” he said. “But first, I want you to tell me what Allan told you.”  

I sighed and put my thumb and my index finger on the top of my nose.  

“Okay,” I said. “They knew that those powered up cryptids...”  

“Great cryptids?” he asked.  

“Who the fuck calls them that?”  

“A lot of people,” he replied.  

“This is the first time I hear it,” I said.  

“Then maybe you should get more friends.”  

“You do know that I can just go to Diana and ask her what the notebook says?” I asked him.  

“Okay, okay,” he replied. “I won’t say anything anymore.”  

“Those... Great cryptids... they are turned into that by the CR-Phantom,” I said.  

I was never going to tell him about the machine.  

“What?” he asked. “Really? How did they find it out?”  

“Appearance of great cryptids followed the CR-Phantom sightings,” I told him. “Great cryptids show up after CR-Phantom was seen.”  

“What is it trying to achieve?” he asked.  

“Well, it did tell me that the one that will conquer our world will come so maybe it’s trying to build an army or something.”  

“That could be true,” Alex said sitting down next to my feet. “What do you think?”  

“I don’t know what to think,” I said. “I don’t think that it’s building an army for sure. At least not with the great cryptids. You know what,” I said. “I think that it’s creating them as a distraction for something much worse.”  

“Hey, you’re the one who knows it the best,” Alex said. “No matter how much I’d like to talk about this, I’m a man of my word... and you’re my friend. At least I hope so.”  

“I’m waiting,” I told him.  

“So, I took the notebook and went to show it to Diana. I thought that there might be some information that we didn’t understand in the form of those illustrations and stuff,” he said.  

“Right, and?”  

“While moving the pages, we got to the part which we thought to be gibberish, but she told me to stop,” he said while looking for the page. “I told her that it was nothing, but before I went to the other page, she told me that she understands it.”  

He managed to find the page on which it was written and once again, it looked like gibberish. Although it started to look like some kind of a language after looking at it for some time.  

“What does it say?” I asked him.  

“That’s the thing,” he replied. “I don’t know. We thought that it was too risky to read it because someone could hear us so we decided that I should visit her this night at 2 AM.”  

“I’m going with you,” I told him immediately.  

“I didn’t expect any less,” he said. “But we have to be careful or find a very good excuse and I don’t think there is one. Allan started to give the guards better equipment and there is more of them. They are sent to patrol during the night and one of the routes is just through the hallway where Diana’s room is.”  

“Just great,” I said sarcastically. “Like things couldn’t have gotten any more fucked.”  

“Oh, believe me, they could have,” he told me. “Apparently someone tried to assassinate Allan.”  

“Holy shit, Alex. The resistance has already made enough trouble,” I tried to explain. “You can’t just do shit like that. It doesn’t only affect you guys.”  

“But here’s the problem,” he started. “We didn’t do it. We didn’t try to assassinate him.”  

“Who did then?” I asked.  

The situation was getting so complicated that I barely kept up with it.  

“We don’t know, but we expect it to be someone from outside,” he said. “Someone from a different facility or someone like who was discarded like Donovan.”  

“Could there be like a coalition or an organization of ex-hunters?” I asked him.  

“No, I don’t think so,” he replied. “Donovan is literally the only one who we could find. In fact, he was the reason why the resistance started. They saw how Allan was too cruel to be the leader.”  

“Why is it getting so complicated?” I asked while putting my hands over my eyes and laying back down on the couch.  

“We’re trying to unravel what is probably a combination of greatest mysteries all of humanity has ever come across and we have to do it by ourselves,” he told me. “It’s destined to be complicated.”  

“I guess you’re right,” I sighed. “Is Lilith here?” I asked him.  

“Yeah,” he replied. "She’s teaching this week. About beasts.”  

Instead of having professors teach new hunters about the cryptids, Allan sends hunters to teach them. He likes to say that hunters will be the best teachers because they went through the experience with the cryptids. He was right about that. Hunters even made it more fun for most of the newcomers because they could ask hunters about their experiences.  

“That’s nice,” I said. “Anyway, I need to get some sleep. I haven’t slept for two days, man.”  

“Have at it, friend,” Alex said patting my leg. “Don’t forget to wake up before 2 AM.”  

“If I don’t, slap me,” I told him. “I’ll need it.”  

“It’s good to see you alive,” he said.  

“You too, man,” I replied. “Me too.”  

He returned to his room while I tried to get some shut-eye. It didn’t take me long to fall asleep.  

I woke up to the noise of the door closing.  

“Hello?” I barely managed to ask and yawned immediately after.  

The lights suddenly turned on, but I still couldn’t see anything. My eyesight was blurry.  

“Damien?” a female voice said.  

I recognized it immediately.  

“How did the lecture go?” I asked while sitting up.  

My eyesight was still blurry. My neck started to hurt so I put my hand on it. Lilith didn’t answer my question. Instead, she sat right next to me and hugged me.  

“Where have you been?” she asked. “You were supposed to return earlier.”  

“Allan wanted to speak to me,” I answered. “He took his time... and mine.”  

Lilith chuckled. It was so good to hear it. Time spent with her was probably the highlight of my life. I always looked forward to seeing or talking to her. She was the last light in my life.  

“You didn’t answer my question,” I told her.  

“Yeah?” she asked.  

“You’re giving lectures?” I asked.  

“You’ve already heard about that?” she asked rhetorically. “I guess the word spreads quite fast.”  

“Alex told me.”  

“It’s pretty good, actually,” she said. “You meet new people with their own stories, and it’s fun helping them. I’ll also have some time off from the hunts.”  

“Oh, is that true?” I asked.  

She looked me in the eyes, smiled, and nodded.  

“Look at how far we have come,” I told her. “And all of that because of a stupid decision.”  

She leaned toward me and put her head on my shoulder.  

“Do you remember them?” she asked. “I mean the gang?”  

“Of course, I do,” I replied. “Every day I dream of avenging them. I’ll never forget them. I promised that.”  

“To be honest with you, I thought about joining them a few times,” she said catching me off-guard. “I thought about ending it...” she stopped for a few seconds. “Did you?”  

“I did,” I replied. “I thought that it might be easier that way. What made you decide not to?”  

“I started to enjoy this life,” she said. “I like the danger, the thrill. And I like seeing you after all of it. How about you?”  

“I don’t know,” I said. “I... just... didn’t. Maybe there was a reason, and maybe there wasn’t, but I wasn’t in the right state of mind to remember it.”  

“I love you, Damien,” she said.  

“And I love you, Lilith,” I replied.  

“I need to put my stuff away,” she told me. “We can watch a movie or something later.”  

“I just want to rest,” I spoke. “You can lay down with me though.”  

“I’ll come,” she smiled, stood up, and went to her room.  

After she disappeared behind the door, I stood up and went to my room. I dropped onto my bed. Lilith came in about 5 minutes later and laid down next to me. I hugged her and we had a small conversation, but I forgot it because I fell asleep only a second after it.  

Instead of waking up during the night or being woken up by Alex, I woke up in the morning with Lilith still sleeping next to me.  

“That little shit,” I whispered realizing that Alex decided not to wake me up.  

“What is it, babe?” Lilith asked with her eyes still closed.  

“Nothing important,” I said kissing her on the cheek. “I just can’t sleep anymore.”  

I stood up and walked up to the door of my room. Just when I was about to open them, I saw a paper in front of them. I picked it up and saw that something was written.  

“I’m going to Diana alone. You need some sleep. Go to my room in the morning. Wake me up if I’m sleeping. If I’m not there, act like you don’t know where I went during the night. Alex.”  

I quietly opened and closed the door and once I was outside, I took a look at the door of Alex’s room.  

“Oh, that little shit,” I whispered to myself.  

I walked up to his door and knocked on it. Suddenly, there were sounds of shuffling coming from the room. I put my ear on the door to try hearing something more. I didn’t hear anything but the shuffling. I backed up a few inches and knocked once more. The shuffling stopped.  

“Fuck,” Alex said.  

He said it quietly but due to the fact that it was early morning and there was no sound coming from the outside, I heard him.  

“It’s me, Alex,” I whispered. “Open the damn door.”  

“Who me?” he asked from the other side.  

I heard him better and I knew that he was much closer to the door now.  

“Here’s a little advice. When you are doing something that you don’t want certain people to know about, don’t ask who is at the door,” I said quietly enough for no one to hear me, but loud enough for it not to be whispering.  

Alex quickly unlocked the door and opened them.  

“Good,” he said. “It’s just you,” he took in a deep breath and exhaled. “Come in. Quickly.”  

When I got into the room, I saw a suitcase lying on his bed. It was filled with clothes and some other stuff. His closet was open and it was almost empty. The journal was sitting on a table that was next to his bed. There were two journals in fact. One was his and the other was Donovan Wayne’s. Before I could read anything from his journal, he squeezed between me and the desk and took his journal.  

“What the hell,” I took a step back.  

“I’ll explain,” Alex said putting the journal in the suitcase. “Just let me pack first.”  

“Why are you packing?” I asked him. “Where are you going?”  

“Allen sending me to UG-Calvin,” he said. “He has some mission for me. I’ll be gone for about a week.”  

“That doesn’t sound right,” I replied. “Are you sure that it’s a mission? Are you sure that he didn’t find out that you’re in the resistance?”  

“There’s no way that he could have,” Alex argued. “We were insanely careful.”  

“I hope that you’re right,” I told him. “Also, why were your doors locked?”  

“The journal was open on the page with the vampiric,” he replied. “I wrote the direct translation right next to it. I couldn’t let anyone see it.”  

“Why didn’t you wake me up?” I asked him.  

“I wanted to, but I couldn’t do it with Lilith lying next to you,” he said.  

I didn’t answer. I just walked up to the desk. Alex moved out of my way and continued packing. I took a look at the journal. Right next to the vampiric text, there was a text in English, but the letters were insanely small. I barely managed to read it.  

Allan Carter, the head of the Equilibrium, is working against the organization. He isn’t trying to help people; he is trying to preserve his life and power. He is willing to do whatever it takes to achieve his selfish goals.  

“What the fuck is this supposed to mean?” I asked him.  

“I don’t know,” Alex replied. “But it’s clearly a message to someone in particular. Someone who knows to speak vampiric,” he said.  

“Or someone who would be able to decode it,” I replied.  

“We didn’t think about that,” he said.  

“We?”  

“Yeah, I talked to the resistance before coming back here. Maybe you should go talk to them.”  

“No, no, no, no, no,” I said turning around towards him. “You can’t drag me into this shit.”  

“You have to. You don’t have to think of it as trying to take down a terrible human being, but as saving your relationship with Lilith and your friends,” he told me. “And after all, our job is to get rid of monsters while one is our boss.”  

I sighed.  

“Okay, I’ll do it,” I replied.  

“Great. I’ll have to explain to you where you have to meet them. By the way, they are all wearing wooden masks that cover their entire face,” he told me. “You shouldn’t wear one though. They’ll recognize you, but don’t be scared. I’m sure that you’d know who they are if you saw their faces.”  

“Do you not realize how suspicious that sounds?” I asked him. “It literally sounds like a trap.”  

“Believe me,” he replied. “We’ve known each other for a few years and had a decent relationship. At least I like to think so. I wouldn’t make you go through something that bad.”  

“Okay, okay,” I said. “When and where do I have to be?”  

“I’ll send you a message while I’m at UG-Calvin,” he answered. “I need to talk to the leader before you two have a conversation.”  

“Can I go on hunts before you do so?” I asked him because I didn’t want to make excuses for Allan.  

“Go,” Alex replied. “But try to return as fast as possible. I need to go now,” he said zipping the suitcase. “I can’t keep others waiting.”  

“Others?”  

“Yeah, I’m not the only one Allan’s sending to UG-Calvin. Another 4 people are going with me,” he told me. “Allan will escort us as well. I hope that I’ll survive.”  

I chuckled.  

“You just have to be careful,” I told him.  

“I will be,” he replied leaving the room and waving. “Oh. And get out of my room,” he said from behind the wall before chuckling.

My name is Jason Farwell Carver, I have stolen these documents so I can inform the American people of the horrors committed by the government. I’m so sorry. The following documents are highly classified. Please be warned that the content within these documents is extremely disturbing.

Exert From Dr. Jason Carver’s Personal Journal:

December 12th, 1987 

I have recently been tasked by the U.S. government with the creation of a new type of methamphetamine they’ve branded as “Blood Crystal”. I am extremely eager to take on this new task, as I haven’t had a large project in 3 years. I am going to the lab on Friday to begin working on the methamphetamine.

December 15th, 1987 

I have begun working on this new project and I have some concerns with this “Blood Crystal”. At first glance, the sample given to me just seems like normal methamphetamine with red coloration, but taking a closer look gave me some reason for concern. The chemical that turns the meth a cloudy red color is a complete mystery to me. When I asked they simply told me the name of the chemical is RED-13.

UPDATE: I have made a batch of this meth and I begin human test on Monday. I have voiced my concerns over RED-13 and the testing of human subjects so early into the project. I was told everything would be fine and not to worry.

The Following is the First Test Subject’s Report:

Effects of Meth Three Hours, Forty Two Minutes, and 18 Seconds After Intake:

Subject is dead, it appears it was a combination of previously unknown swelling inside of the throat, and organ failure.

Personal note: I suggest we discontinue human tests until the meth is more stable. And after the meth is stabilized, I believe the best course of action to be using it on animals.




I am in extreme danger publishing these files. I could possibly die. It is worth it to expose all Of the fucked up shit the government does. I will try and steal more documents than last time if I can, stay tuned. If I do not publish any more documents, I am dead.

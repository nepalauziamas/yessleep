I was covered in more tears and snot than I’d like to admit, because even I feel sensitive when dead children get up and walk away.  

The cigarettes in my pocket were softly calling my name, so I pulled one out and flicked the lighter. 

It wouldn’t catch. The dancing light was just enough to illuminate a vivid crimson sheen on my fingertips that extended its damp reach to my cancer stick.

I couldn’t smoke because the cigarette was covered in children’s blood.

Now I was vengeful *and* irritable.

That’s when I decided to have a little meeting with the owner of this rancid house.

Looking around the room, I got a feel for the shape of the path in front of me. 

Then I flicked out the light. 

I softly crept across the cool earth, then climbed the darkened steps back up into the house above. The trap door creaked over my head as I lifted it and emerged into the pungent room.

Soft fur brushed against my shins. I smiled. “Let’s see if there are any garden shears in the backyard, Sophocles,” I responded to the cat below me. “We need to re-adjust a certain gentleman’s interpretation of manhood.”

“He’s too lazy for garden tools, but you’ll find an ax out by the shed,” came the woman’s voice from behind me.

This is why I yearned for brown underwear in my first few years on the job.

I slowly turned around to face the person standing behind me in the dark.

Moonlight streamed through the window just well enough to light up her face.

Or, more accurately, what was left of her face.

The top left chunk of the woman’s head was split wide open. White and gray tendrils dazzled in the moonlight as I looked deep into her shattered skull. One eyeball hung loosely from its optic nerve. It jiggled on her cheek as she spoke. 

I sighed. “Looks like you’ve had a rough go-round, Honey, but you wouldn’t believe the day *I’ve* had. Any chance you know where I could find a smoke?”

She bore into me with her one good eye for several seconds as I grew more impatient. “The only smoke he has on hand is a little bit of meth, if that’s your style.”

I scowled. “Look, Honey, I’m really on edge right now. I’m sure the cops have found the last woman I killed by this point, I just failed a dead girl, there has been an *appalling* lack of naked man-ghosts as of late, and my cigarettes have been destroyed by all the blood. Are you going to tell me more about this ax, or should I just burn the fucking house down?”

*

I really, *really* didn’t want to go deeper into the house, but I learned long ago that you have to embrace swarms of flies when you’re dealing with shit. 

“Are you *sure* you want to wake him?” the ghost woman asked nervously as she stood by the door. “He’s going to react… poorly.”

I grabbed the knob. “Listen, Mindy. I’ve gone twenty minutes without a smoke, and *this* waste of skin is the reason.” I threw open the door. “*I’m* going to react poorly.”

The smell of body odor and semen attacked my nose with such aggression that I had to fight against my gag reflex. Through the tears in my eyes, I could see the form of a man lying on a stained mattress set haphazardly in the middle of a disheveled room. The greasy strands of thinning gray hair covered an unshaved face. He farted.

“My name isn’t Mindy,” the ghost whispered. “I dated him for 19 years, since I was 13, and he shot me in the face. Please be careful.” 

I strode quickly across the nasty room and kicked him in the head. He awoke with a snort.

“Who the fuck are you?” he shouted in hazy bewilderment.

“I’m a lady with standards, which will understandably cause you confusion. You can call me ‘ma’am.’ Decorum says that you should put on pants in my presence, but the visual evidence makes it clear that you have nothing worth covering. Now stand up, young man.”

Instead, he reached into a pile of soiled underwear that was festering by his head and pulled out an extraordinarily large pistol. He pointed it at my face and smiled.

I stared at the length of the gun’s barrel. “Makes sense,” I offered coolly. 

He didn’t get it.

“I don’t know what you’re doin’ in my bedroom, cause I don’t fuck old meat,” he slurred as he got to his wobbly feet. 

The man kept the gun aimed at my head, so I didn’t move. “I’m here to deliver a message from Mindy.”

He stepped closer to me.

“My name is Starla,” she interjected.

I closed my eyes and sighed. Of course it was “Starla.”

“I mean Starla. I’m here to talk to you about the girlfriend you murdered.”

Blinding white *angry* pain erupted across my head and I was swirling until I hit the floor. Copper and *anguish* filled my mouth. I grabbed my face and felt my teeth.

Good. None had been knocked loose in his pistol whip. 

I spat blood on the floor.

Then I stood and faced him.

His eyes rolled in wild confusion.

“You’ve never seen a woman stand up after hitting her, have you?” I asked as I wiped my sleeve against my lip to clean the blood. I panted. *Fuck,* my face hurt. “Get up to speed quick, because we have to talk about how Starla told me that you buried her beneath the house. *You* thought that no one would find out, but *I* can see more than you’ll ever imagine.” My world spun with residual dizziness, and I adjusted my footing for balance.

“How – what?” he asked with all the elegance of a gorilla scratching its ass.

“He used to tell me that I was the only one who made him feel less ashamed,” the woman whispered from the corner. I could tell that she was crying. 

“I’ll need something more specific,” I explained as I spat more blood on the floor. “Something *only* you would know.”

The look on his face told me that he didn’t understand why I was talking to someone he couldn’t see, which only increased his anger.

She sniffed. “Um… he – well, he would ask me to tie his, you know – his nuts up with string before he banged me… you mean like that?”

For fuck’s sake. Couldn’t he have remembered her favorite flower?

No. Of course not.

I cleared my throat. “I can see ghosts, jackass. Your dead girlfriend is telling me that your li’l pecker only got up when she tied your testicles up with a bow. Is that right, Champ?”

His eyes grew wide. “How the fuck do you fucking know that shit, you witch?” He teetered on pasty legs.

“I – yes, we’ll go with that. I’m a witch. And I’m here to tell you a secret.”

He stared at me with fear, because he was unable to process respect.

The fish was on the line.

“Starla knows that you’re the best thing that ever happened to her,” I explained softly.

“No I don’t,” she interrupted. “I hated him. He masturbated to Scooby-Doo. I was just too afraid to leave.”

“She wants you to be safe,” I continued in a nurturing tone. “Everyone’s in danger. We’re about to be attacked by foreigners! But you can be spared if you’re with her!”

His eyes grew wide. The fish was reeling in.

“She’s buried in the basement, but Starla knows you love her. [You have a bomb shelter]( https://old.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/b59hoa/im_patricia_barnes_hitman_for_ghosts_that_only_i/) down there, don’t you? Underneath the house, far away from everything bad, you can be safe.”

His eyes danced. “We’re – being attacked? When?”

I narrowed my gaze at him. “Right now.”

He pushed me aside and ran out of the room. 

Fish, meet barrel.

The ax weighed heavily in my hands as I descended the staircase into the primitive basement for the second time that night. The smell of decaying flesh was clearer this time, but that only furthered my resolve. 

I flicked on the lighter just long enough to find the flashlight, but I couldn’t ignore the dead girl on the mattress as I bent down.

“Repose en paix,” I whispered delicately. “I’m so sorry.”

I turned on the flashlight and swiveled it around the room. It shined through the dead woman standing next to me and lit up the structure behind her.

Deep tracks were carved in the fresh dirt below the heavy door of the bomb shelter, revealing that it had been forced open shortly before I’d climbed into the basement.

It was currently closed, and the room was empty aside from me, the ghost, and Sophocles. 

The fish was in the frying pan, and I had one *hell* of an appetite. 

I walked resolutely to the door and rested my hand on the wheel that had to be spun to open it. 

It was locked tight. 

I smiled.

Then I raised the ax high above my head, turned it around so that the sharp end was facing behind me, and swung. 

The first crash had little effect.

The second one dented the wheel. 

But the two hundredth swing knocked the damn thing clean off and into the dirt.

I collapsed to the ground and leaned against the door, panting for air. “You’re sure,” I gasped, “that he has no way of communicating with the outside world, and no way of opening the door now that the handle is broken?”

Mindy, or Starla, or whoever she was nodded slowly. “He used to lock me in there for days at a time,” she said shakily. “No one on the outside can hear the screams.” She sighed deeply. “Trust me, the man’s easy to predict. I told you that he wouldn’t react to the pounding, because he believed you were trying to get access to the safety of the shelter.” She wiped her good eye. The other one swung on its nerve. “He showed me every detail of the door’s handle to prove how easily he could seal me in permanently. There’s no way he’s getting out.”

“Good,” I heaved. “Now how much water does he have? I’d like to know if he’ll die of asphyxiation or thirst.” I coughed, then shook my head. “You know what? Never mind. I like a little mystery in my life, and both endings are happy.” I got to my feet and faced the door. “Make peace with whatever god or devil awaits your heart,” I offered to him. Then I turned around and pointed the flashlight at the ghost.

“But you like a little mystery too, don’t you, Mindy?” I asked as I pulled out a cigarette and lit it. 

*Fuck,* there’s the rush of nicotine I needed. My toes dazzled like I had finally orgasmed after three dry days. 

Now I was ready to face what came next.

“You told me that he had no cigarettes, yet I swiped a box right off the rancid floor. I normally demand a higher standard in my smokes, but you know what they say about ports and storms.” I blew a delightful stream of smoke into the flashlight’s weak beam. “So. What else are you hiding from me?”

She blanched, which was such an *odd* thing to see in a person who was missing so much of her face. “I didn’t – nothing, nothing at all.”

I shook my head. “Mindy, Mindy, Mindy. This is *not* my first rodeo, Honey.” I clenched the cigarette between my teeth. “You’ve been playing the victimized girlfriend this whole time, which is a *vicious* half-truth.”

She swallowed and took a step back. 

I’m not going to lie, it’s thrilling when ghosts are afraid of *me.*

“I’m sure our disgusting friend in the bomb shelter treated you like shit, but it’s hard to sympathize when I think of how many children the two of you must have killed together.”

I bore my eyes into her, looking for *any* hint that my suspicions were wrong.

I found none. She was a terrible poker player.

“Now listen to me, you bitch. You’re going to tell me who *actually* killed you, who you’re working for, and why [they’re coming after me](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/).”

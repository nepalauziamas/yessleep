“Get them containers lined up, boys!” shouted the stout old man from the catwalk. Marcus Jasper, the warehouse foreman, was a wall of muscle topped off with a wild tangle of long white hair and a bushy beard. If Santa Claus had a Viking cousin, Jasper would be it. “Our delivery window opens in less than twenty-four hours and we’ve got pups on the crew this time. Gotta show ‘em the ropes!”

Jasper looked down from the catwalk and gave me a wink as I drove the forklift forward. Dozens of other men scurried around the cavernous room checking shipping manifests and container contents.

I’d been working for Shift Logistics Warehouse for eight months. It was an easy job with a payscale that made my head spin. I loved it, but I still had a hard time believing what Jasper told me we did.

The job offer had arrived out of nowhere. After a brief stint in the military, I had secured work at the Port of Los Angeles as a forklift driver. Most of my military career had been spent in warehousing. My skill and speed in military logistics and shipping had translated well to civilian life.

Nine months ago, I was walking to my truck at the end of the shift when I saw a mountainous man leaning against the tailgate. Smoke billowed from a cigar dangling haphazardly from the corner of his mouth. We made eye contact and he tossed a hand the size of a bear paw in the air to greet me.

“Ahoy!” the man bellowed. “Your name Edgar Black?”

“Who’s asking?” I responded curtly.

The man bellowed laughter that filled the parking lot. “I’m Marcus Jasper and I work for Shift Logistics. A buddy of mine works here at the port and said you’re an ace on a forklift. Prior military too, I understand. Also a plus, son.”

“I’m pretty happy here,” I replied. “It would take a good pay increase to consider making a move.”

Jasper slid a hand into his back pocket and pulled out a folded yellow envelope. He pushed it in my hands and swatted me on the shoulder, nearly sending me reeling forward.

“Take a look at that packet there, son,” he said and began to walk away. “Tells you as much information as we can share for now. I do my homework and know that your finances aren’t in great shape. Got some creditors after you from what I understand. Could be the answer to your money woes. My number’s on the last page. Call me if you’re interested. I’m flyin’ out tomorrow.”

I read the packet that night. Most of the job descriptions seemed straightforward and varied little from the standard load and unload duties I had been working at the Port of Los Angeles. My position there would be operating a forklift to unload and store shipments in the Shift Logistics Warehouse.

While the first part had made sense, the contract became more strange as I continued. The warehouse was located on a twenty-five square mile patch of land in an undisclosed state. A perimeter barrier had been constructed around the entire property and I would be assigned patrol detail a few times each month to ensure the barrier was intact. Military experience was preferred as firearms were required use during the patrols.

If the massive amount of land and patrol detail wasn’t strange enough, our delivery schedule sealed the deal. We only made one massive delivery each year. Shipments would arrive during the first eleven months. The remaining month before delivery would be spent preparing everything for the move and daily equipment inspections to ensure nothing malfunctioned.

Strangest of all, the delivery would be made within the twenty-five square mile compound.

A non-disclosure agreement was attached to the back. While I had assumed the majority of the envelope contents would be a job description, the NDA took up the bulk. In it, I was informed that the location, nature of our work, contents of the warehouse, and nature of our clientele were to remain secret.

At the end of the NDA where I expected to see the financial penalties, I was shocked to see that any breach of contract was punishable by a lengthy term in federal prison.

A bright yellow sticky note sat at the bottom of the page.

*Call if you’re interested, kid. $200,000 per year.*

The next morning, Jasper sat across the aisle from me on the private jet, quietly reading over stacks of papers.

“Sir, excuse me,” I said. “Could you tell me about the job? The description was vague and I’m not sure why a private company would have an NDA that could result in federal prison time.”

The old man placed the clipboard on the seat beside him.

“You want the real answer or a believable answer?” he asked with a Cheshire grin.

“The real answer, please,” I replied.

“Here goes nothin’,” he chortled. “Shift Logistics is a warehouse and protected property in Wyoming. Easy to get a lotta land out there. The campus is twenty-five square miles with a large perimeter barrier. We also own all the land for 20 miles in both directions. No fly zone overhead. Our work needs privacy, ya see.”

I nodded.

“We spend most of the year receiving shipments of just about anything you can imagine. Food, clothing, medication, technical equipment, light weaponry, gasoline, and vehicles.”

“Are we military?” I asked.

“We ain’t public or private. Little of both. This is an organization that started in the 1960s but the government is… well… a big supporter of their work. The whole setup is a little hard to wrap your head around.”

“So what’s the unbelievable part?”

Jasper smiled at me. “For one day a year, during a twelve-hour period, an entire town will appear within the twenty-five square mile perimeter. During that period, you and the rest of the team will move a year’s wortha goods into a warehouse within that town and depart. Every couple of years, some personnel selected by the government to stay in the town get dropped off too. After twelve hours, the town will disappear again.”

“Bullshit,” I said. “A town appears and disappears and we’re… what? Their delivery men? Where does it go and why do we take them these supplies?”

“We take ‘em the supplies because they pay us a pile of money to do it,” he said firmly. “We drop the supplies those folks need to live for a year and we pick up a few smaller loads and return them to our warehouse. The government picks up what we take outta the town the next day then transfers us another year of operating costs. Then we spend eleven months prepping for the next drop.”

I peppered Jasper with dozens of questions for the remainder of the flight, but Marcus Jasper just shrugged his shoulders to all of them and returned to his clipboard.

“I don’t ask questions, kid,” he said indifferently. “Shift Logistics pays my bills and then some. Folks in the town are friendly. Scientist types. Government don’t hover over my shoulder. We get paid.”

My mind swam and our plane continued on.

Fat snowflakes drifted from the sky and melted on the windshield of the delivery truck as I sat waiting to make my first delivery. Wyoming was beautiful, but after so many years in California, a frigid winter seemed exceptionally brutal. The heat was blasting from the dash of the truck but a chill had settled in my bones. I told myself it was the cold, but I was terrified that Jasper was right.

My truck sat outside of the warehouse bay doors, nose pointed into an empty field that stretched as far as my eyes could see. Floodlights from the building behind me blasted into the darkness, illuminating the snow-covered plain. If Jasper and the rest of the crew had been telling the truth, in less than five minutes a small town would materialize in front of my eyes.

A young woman sat calmly in the passenger seat beside me. Her eyes were closed and her head tilted back against the seat to feign sleep, but I knew she was awake. Jasper had informed me that morning that she was a new resident of the mysterious town and would accompany me to the delivery site.

I had introduced myself and tried to make small talk, but she was all business. She wore drab green military-style fatigues and carried a duffle bag. A sleek handgun was fastened to her belt. Dozens of other men and women fitting the same description were scattered throughout the delivery fleet awaiting transport to their strange destination.

“We are given explicit instructions not to share any information with the contractors,” she had said. “Thank you for understanding.”

My following attempts to make small talk was met with equally polite but curt responses. I was nervous and continued trying to talk to her. In response, she had pretended to go to sleep.

The radio on my dash crackled to life. A series of high-pitched sirens blasted through. The young woman in the seat beside me bolted up and looked straight ahead.

“Good morning, ladies and gents,” boomed a deep baritone boss. “This is Marcus Jasper. The final countdown has now reached thirty seconds. Shipment fifty-one will commence on my mark. If this is your first delivery, move quickly. While we’ve got a twelve-hour window, our goal is complete delivery by the two-hour mark followed by a two-hour pick-up and retrieval window for all outgoing containers and any disembarking personnel from the town. This will leave us with an eight-hour window for troubleshooting if anything goes FUBAR. No one wants an unexpected ride to the other side. Brace for arrival.”

The other side? What the hell was he talking about?

Before I could wrap my mind around the strangeness of the message, yellow caution lights erupted from the warehouse behind us. My ears began to ring. A few of the old metal fillings in my teeth began to rattle. The air pressure seemed to be compressing and my breathing became labored and ragged.

The young woman in the seat beside me didn’t speak, but shot her hand across the cab of the truck and grasped mine. I squeezed hers in return.

A quarter mile down the hill, a faint circle of light appeared. From this distance, it looked no larger than the diameter of a swimming pool. The ring of illumination began to pulse rapidly. As the intensity grew, the circle began to expand as it became taller.

Waves of light and intense vibrations filled the field. The entire complex was bathed in the glow from the massive anomaly that appeared before us. I could feel the truck beginning to rumble and the ground below us quaked.

The light became blinding. It was so strong it seemed to blast between the fingers of my hand as I held it in front of my face. I braced myself for an explosion or shockwave, but to my surprise, everything remained silent. The light faded and the vehicle sat still.

Pulling the hand away from my eyes and letting the young woman’s hand drop, I marveled as I gazed through the windshield of the cab.

A massive platform covered the field at the bottom of the hill from the warehouse. Towering stadium lights blanketed two colossal warehouses perched on the edge of the platform nearest to us. Beyond the huge metal buildings, I could see water towers, neat rows of tiny houses, and a few taller buildings that resembled lecture halls from a college campus.

“It’s go time, ladies and gents,” Jasper announced over the radio. “I will hail the control room at Warehouse 1 during the approach. Reassemble delivery formation at the base of the entry ramp. Once the ramp light turns green, enter and fall into your assigned drop order. Caravan forward!”

I hesitated as I watched the trucks beside me pull away. A loud wail from the truck behind me erupted and startled me into motion. My foot slammed down on the gas pedal and the tires spun on the concrete before finding purchase and jolting us forward.

“Easy there, killer,” the young woman said. “Get us there in one piece if you can, okay?”

I smiled. “Will do, ma’am.”

My heart thundered as we arrived at the bottom of the ramp that led into the mysterious town. Now that we were at the bottom of the hill, I could see the top of the platform was nearly forty feet off of the ground. I pulled the truck into formation and put it in park, staring in wonder. The radio remained silent.

“Two years of training and I still can’t believe I’m here,” the woman said. “I wonder why the light is still red.”

I looked at the red light that was illuminated to the right of the ramp. The “Go” light below sat black and deadened. During our prep discussions, Jasper had told the crew that the entry light usually lit up before we even reached the ramp. I wasn’t worried yet, but it had taken us five minutes to form up the delivery formation.

“Truck 27, this is Marcus Jasper.” The radio crackled without warning. “Samantha Michaels, this is a truck-to-truck transmission. The rest of the fleet is cut from this loop. Do you copy?”

The young woman, who I now knew was Samantha Michaels, picked up the radio mic and responded that she received the message.

“Ma’am, my hails are going unanswered,” Jasper responded. I could hear worry in his voice. “I have performed the standard five hail series with no response. You’re new here, I know, but I understand you were due to assume site management. As a courtesy, I’m asking permission to enact Code Blue. We’ve never failed to receive a response during any previous delivery.”

I looked at Samantha and saw her hand tremble as she clutched the mic.

“Understood, Mr. Jasper,” she said in a shaking voice. “Our director has informed me of your military record. Permission granted. I request that you lead the operation. The new site personnel shall remain in their vehicles with your staff but I will accompany you for point inspection. Pick your best men, sir. We don’t know what will be in there.”

“Understood and confirmed, ma’am,” Jasper replied. The steel had returned to his voice.

After a few moments of dead air, Marcus Jasper’s voice once again flooded from the radio. He called for the driver of twenty specifically numbered trucks including mine. We were instructed to remove an M4 carbine rifle, Kevlar vest, and communication earpiece. A tent was being set up at the rear of the convoy and a beacon light would be placed. All personnel summoned were to report within the next five minutes.

I collected my gear and Samantha and I stepped onto the snow-covered ground. Behind the truck, we could see a bright beam of light piercing the sky from the rear of the convoy. As we walked, I strapped on my vest, inserted my earpiece, and began to examine my weapon to make sure everything was in functioning order.

When we arrived, Marcus Jasper stood in the center of a cluster of twenty men. He tossed a Kevlar vest through the air to Samantha who secured it on her torso. Another man stepped forward and handed her an earpiece and carbine. Jasper directed everyone to remain quiet and gave Samantha Michaels the floor.

“Ladies and gentlemen,” she said calmly. “I am going to give you a brief amount of need-to-know information before we enter the site. This site was constructed decades ago by a group of scientists who hungered for a world free of war, famine, and political intrusion in their work. Some of the brightest minds of their day, they created a small community here named Mirage Station. To find a location untainted by the evils of this world, a group of physicists designed and produced technology that allowed a small town to be removed from this reality and relocated to an alternative dimension where humanity either never existed or failed to thrive. There are no apex predators on the planet and sentient life has never been discovered. Flaura and fauna discovered there are often similar to what we have here with varying evolutionary differences.”

My eyes expanded to the size of dinner plates. An alternate universe? I wanted to think it was impossible, but this town had materialized in front of my eyes.

“Each year, Mirage Station shifts back to this reality for supply replenishment and to deliver research and technology efforts to our world. In return for their research and discoveries, the US government funds their work. Some of our most important advances in medicine and technology are developed on Mirage Station. For the last fifty years, the shipment exchange has gone off without a hitch, but we have failed to receive facility contact. Mr.Jasper has enacted a Code Blue response. This team will enter Mirage Station in an attempt to make contact with personnel. In the event we fail to make contact, we will use the remaining eleven and a half-hour window to investigate the cause of contact failure. Mirage Station’s dimensional displacement system is self-piloting. In twelve hours, this town will shift back, with or without us.”

We all nodded in agreement and Jasper placed us in an entry formation. Nervously, the cluster of men and women marched forward behind the old man. Our boots thudded against the metal ramp as we began our ascent into Mirage Station.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

An hour after entering Mirage Station and we hadn’t seen a single soul. The receiving warehouse was clean, empty, and prepped to receive the supply delivery. Upon entering the export warehouse, we discovered all of the outgoing containers sealed and ready for our team to remove. After communication equipment checks in the control room of the loading area, we found everything to be in working order. There were no signs of distress.

That was until we began to perform a sweep of the houses nearest to the warehouses.

The first dozen homes we entered seemed to be perfectly intact. Each home had a spartan but comfortable living room, kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom. The furnishings in each were the same as the one before. Small keepsakes and photos on the wall provided the only variations.  All of them were tidy.

As we rounded the corner into the next row of houses, our concerns mounted. While the first row of homes was as expected, the door of the second row was all caved in. White shards of wood were scattered into the living rooms of each home. Dozens of deep grooves were hewn into the wood by whatever had forced their way into the homes.

“I want four groups of five men and women. Three will enter the homes and one crew will escort me and Ms. Michaels to the central control office in the center of the station,” Jasper said flatly. “Clear each house and search for signs of survivors or hostiles. If it isn’t human, call for backup and put a bullet in it. Any unusual activity should be reported to the rest of the crew immediately.”

Jasper divided us into teams before departing. One by one, we entered the houses on the second row. Each door has been ripped to shreds and showered into the living rooms. Long dried blood and dehydrated flesh showered the walls. The same deep grooves from the entryway were randomly found throughout the houses.

The smell of rot and carrion almost caused me to vomit with each home we entered. Each home was the same bloodbath with every new entry. Still, there remained no sign of either survivors or hostiles. Whatever had done this may well have left the station after the attack.

My team was about to enter our fifth house when the sound of gunfire erupted from across the street. Deafening waves filled the air as M4 carbines exploded into life. Screams and wails soon mingled with the gunfire as we began to exit a deserted bedroom to respond.

My earpiece roared to life. “Hostiles detected by Team Two. I repeat, hostels detected by Team Two. Everett and Bernstein are down. The subject is entering the street in row two. Fire at will. Hostile is…”

The voice in my earpiece suddenly erupted in a shriek. Rasps and gurgles swallowed the horrific exclamations. Growls, grunts, and the wet ripping of flesh filled all of our ears before a static-filled crunch left us all in deafening silence.

“Team three, return to the front of the house and find a firing point through the windows.” I directed. “Use couches and tables as barriers.”

The five of us squatted low and moved to the large window in the front of the living room. Two of the crewmen at the rear overturned the couch and coffee table to provide coverage. Slowly, I shuffled to the window, unlatched it, and pushed it open before propping my gun on the windowsill.

Scanning the barrel from side to side, there was no sign of the reported hostile. In the doorway directly across the street from our position, I could see a body dressed in Kevlar, still clutching its M4 across its chest. At first, I thought they were dead but I was startled when they turned their head to meet my gaze. A shaking hand lifted in the air and reached out toward me.

Before I could give the order to move to the occupied house, a massive white claw came from beyond the doorframe and sank itself into the crewman’s chest. Their arm spasmed as blood erupted from their mouth. The claw retracted and dragged the body out of sight. Screams again filled the air followed by a triumphant roar that [rattled my bones.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gtripp14/comments/uyezti/making_it_easier_to_keep_track_of_my_new_releases/)

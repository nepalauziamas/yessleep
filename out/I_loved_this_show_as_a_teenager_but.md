When I was maybe 14 or 15, I would always go downstairs at around 7pm to watch my favourite show, it was a horror show, I forget the title but I do remember it was about a clown cursed clown statue, who would always attempt to murder their owner, anyway, around a week ago, me and my wife were going on a date, just us two, and we got a babysitter for our two kids. As we drove to the place, we passed a creepy clown statue and remembered the show, I told my wife but she didn’t see it in time. I asked her about the show but she said she had no memory of it, fine, I get that, not everyone watches the same shows. “I’ll google it” she told me, When she did, she found something weird, it was canceller before the pilot came out, but that’s impossible, I watched it everyday, it was weird and just tried to keep my mind off of it, the show and statue.

I looked at the map and saw that we were 7 minutes away from the restaurant, “good, we’re going to be there on time” I told my wife. She didn’t say anything. When we finally got to the restaurant, I checked my watch and saw that it was 8:43, we did missed our reservation, how? There was so much traffic, then a silly thought came to mind, in the show, the victim would start getting bad luck before they were attacked, but it was stupid, and my wife agreed. We had our date, it was incredible, there was steak there which was phenomenal, as we were driving home, the statue had gone. I thought it was weird because, who would just take a random clown statue from off the side of the road, i think you see where this is going.

Me and Jenny (my wife) finally made it home, despite the traffic, the kids were asleep and we paid the babysitter, perfect, we got into bed and just as I was about to fall asleep “DAAD, I FEEL SICK” oh great, more bad luck, i got up reluctantly to help my son, and he threw up everywhere, on me, on the carpet. I helped my son then put my shirt in the wash, I went to the basement to find the washing equipment, it was dark in there, but just as i was about to turn on the light, I saw two, red beady eyes, staring at me, I turned on the light and they disappeared, i thought “hey i’m just tired, probably just imagined it”

3 days later it was me and Jenny’s anniversary, we brought my mom over to care of the kids while we were gone, we decided to go to Dubai for our anniversary, as 10 years is a very important milestone. We got to the airport and everything was normal, nothing weird for the whole flight, when we got there we went out for dinner, we got back to the hotel and decided to have some *fun* before going to sleep, Jenny woke up at 3am and asked “can we move that statue? It’s freaking me out”

“There was never a clown statue there, let me call reception” I did so, but nobody came, i went to investigate, it was deserted, it’s like everyone died. We went back up to our room, but the statue was gone, at this point i realised that the show was somehow cursed to bring the characters to life, but because I was so tired, all I could think was the same thing you are “oh how cliché” 

I realised, it won’t move if we’re looking at it, so we tried to evade it as best as possible, when we got out the room, we ran, I was trying to think of something and then realised. In the show, a random person gets cursed, and the only way to get rid if the curse is transfer the curse to someone else, by simply telling another person about the clown, that’s why it went after Jenny, I told her about the clown (and show). But no one was around to tell the story to, so that’s why I’m here, I really am sorry but we were left no other choice, I told you our story, it’s after you now.

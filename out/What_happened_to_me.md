let me start off by saying I have no idea what happened to me.  Any guidance would help.  

It was late at night, around 3oclock in the morning.  Im laying next to my girlfriend whose passed out and I’m just staring at the ceiling.  I start to get this weird feeling and then this vibration starts happening within my entire existence.  Usually I can see in the room at night from the moonlight and LED’s from random electronics throughout the room.  But every time I opened my eyes it was the same blackness as when I had my eyes shut.  I rubbed my eyes and all the sudden there is a silhouette of a wolf about 2 inches from my face.  I cant break its stare either, everywhere i looked it followed.  Blocking my vision.  All of this is happening while that vibration was going on.  Then the wolf suddenly disappears and I’m having an out of body experience, and I’m a few feet off the ground looking at me and my girlfriend laying in bed.  At this point I want to scream but no voice is coming out.  I start to feel the feeling of terror but then I noticed it feels like I’m being held from the back of my neck like a mother cat would hold her kitten with her mouth as shes walking.  After what felt like 10 minutes of pure terror, I feel whatever was holding the back of my neck let go, i fall and I feel my feet hit the ground.  I look at the bed and I’m no longer having an out of body experience because I’m not in the bed.  Apparently A loud thud woke up my girlfriend and she’s looking at me with pure terror because she could see the look on my face.  I thud was my feet hitting the ground I think.  

I really don’t know what happened to me that night but any suggestions or similar stories or anything at this point would help. It’s been years since this happened to me but I don’t think I’ll ever forget it in my entire life.

Fast forward 5 years.  I’m no longer with that girl anymore, I have my own house in the country on 10 acres.  I’m upstairs in my room and I was about to go walk downstairs I get this overwhelming feeling of doom because that same vibration starts happening.  I start to feel the same feeling on the back of my neck, it doesn’t hurt it’s just a light hold.  But it forces my head to turn and look at myself in the mirror.  And as I look at myself the vibration gets a lot stronger.  As I lock eyes with my reflection I suddenly switch sides with myself(the relection) then switch back.  I fall to my knees and my vision goes black.  I don’t remember what happened after this all I know is that I woke up on the first level of my house in a puddle of my own drool a few hours later.  

Since then I’ve moved away from the country, closer to the city so I can be around people.  I feel that these experiences have been controlling my decisions in life because I’m scared.  

No drugs or alcohol were a factor in any of these experiences.  I also have zero history of mental illness.  

Any info would help.  Thank you.

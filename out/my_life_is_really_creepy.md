"All right let me start off from the beginning of when this shit started happening.


I was around 7 or 8 years old, I remember this because that was around the time my parents were having a big argument with the court in judicial system.


I was placed in the mental hospital somewhere in Wisconsin.


I had this friend named Cole and he was supposed to be wearing his little protective helmet. That day he went up to a brick wall and started ramming his head into the wall. Mind you, he is prone to epileptic seizures.


The next thing I know he fell backwards in an epileptic seizure. I started crying out for help for the people that work there to come and help my friend but nobody came. 


Then the next thing that happened, something materialized out of thin air and said something to me in an unknown language and touched my friend Cole, at which point Cole stopped jerking around and started spitting foam out of his mouth, and I'm thinking, "WTF is going on?"


I had to go through extensive therapy for that.


Sometime later in my High School years, (I don't clearly recall what year it was) I started hearing something moving up in my attic. And it starts getting creepier than that. 


My parents had recently put an alarm on my door to let them know that I'm out and about using the restroom (the reason for the alarm I don't want to go into much detail about), and the alarm that they had on my door was starting to go dead so they replaced it with a new one. 


So sometime that night a door opened up abruptly, the alarm fell down and hit abruptly, simultaneously waking up everybody in the household which includes both of my parents, my sister, my little niece & myself.


The alarm kept waking us all up about 4 or 5 more times, my parents kept coming out of their room, yelling at me not to open up the door. But I'd been in my bed this whole time! 


Thinking back to the time before they even put the alarm on my door, here is the creepiest thing that you will ever hear:


One night I started getting this feeling that I was going to die so I abruptly woke up and mind you my room is pitch black. There's a window with some light coming through it and 


there's some unknown entity standing over by my closet so will I go and do as I get up and I get ready to freaking fight off whatever is about to kill me so I gear up and throw a couple punches, it's like this thing is not even phased. The next thing I knew it swings at my head, hits me in the temple, and I went unconscious.


The next morning I woke up with my head by my bookshelf and my feet by my bed so I'm sitting there thinking to myself, "Like WTF just happened?" 


Eventually I had to go to Houston and take care of my grandmother and in Houston I was sent to jail because of an incident that happened between me and my grandmother.


When they released me from jail they put me in a group home and the reason why because I got a restraining order put against me and my grandmother because a court of law thing and stuff 


like that time I had a roommate named Shalom and I was telling him about the creature called The Rake. we instantly see something moving by the house next door, it was a very quick shadow, right? Then all of a sudden we see it darting all over the place, 


mind you, the staff member that was working that weekend was actually inside making herself something to eat, and this was at night...I digress...


All of a sudden I start seeing something around the corner on our building like a looming shadow in the light we have the porch light on that side of the house and the next thing I see is long claw like fingers starting to reach out from behind the wall so I'm like, "Oh fuck."


So we quickly went back inside the house, we locked the screen door and the main door, and i swear we were about to die that night and that's just  some of many creepy things I've seen.

My name is Rahul Sharma and I am from Lucknow city of Uttar Pradesh, India .
I am a cardio-thoracic surgeon by profession and today i am not able to get help from anywhere other than internet....please help me..
Let's start from the start.

I am an orphan and have lived in orphanage for 18 years and at the same time I also did my schooling. I always loved seeing doctors in white coats and I myself used to think that I too would grow up to be a doctor. Anyways , luck favored and I got selected in Indira Gandhi Medical College, Shimla.

Shimla has given me many beautiful things in my life.. like new and lovely friends, good teachers and Prerna.
Prerna was one year senior to me and all the boys of my batch were fascinated by her beauty, her big eyes, her sweet voice had convinced me too and made me fall in love with her .

Slowly our conversation started and this conversation slowly turned from friendship and friendship to love.  
We both used to spend a lot of time together , studying together , traveling and going camping .

If the most beautiful and sweetest moments of our life in Himachal were our camping days. We used to go camping every month for 3-4 days , away from the hustle and bustle of the city .

We used to spend very beautiful 3-4 days together just by being with each other in the middle of the quiet mountains. 

Anyways ,She graduated before me and me in her next year but our relationship was never broken.
After becoming a surgeon, I went to her house  and talked about our marriage and she was also ready because she too had now become a very good gynecologist. 

I spoke to Prerna's parents, they agreed and we got married the same year. 

And after 2 years of marriage, a little lovely angel gave me and Prerna the pleasure of being parents.
I was very happy, I had got all that without which I had spent 25 years of my life. 

 A lovely family, a lovely little daughter and a wonderfully respectable job.
I had immense blessings of the Lord and this small world of mine was very happy.

Slowly my daughter grew up and started talking... "Daddy" from her mouth when it fell on my ears. it was like honey dissolving in my ears 
That smile of her .. that lovely smile of hers always used to make me blossom.

But someone couldn't digest our happiness. 
 This little world of mine was ruined that day when my 6 year old daughter did not return from school.

I got a call from Prerna when I was in my office...she was nervous and in a state of crying started telling me.
"Rahul.. Rahul.. Rahul Jolly hasn't reached home yet.."
"It may be that his school bus is running a little late, so many times you are worrying for no reason.." I said calming her down.

"No Rahul today, today the bus has arrived but there was no jolly in it Rahul.. I asked the driver, he said that jolly had not even left the school.I'm not feeling well Rahul please go to school... please bring my jolly home" Prerna started begging me while crying.

"Okay okay you don't panic, maybe she has stayed in school till late, I am going to school now, don't get stressed" I hung up the phone saying this.
After cancelling all of my upcoming appointments, I sat in my car and went to Jolly's school.

When I reached there the school staff was leaving but the reception was still open I ran to the reception and inquired about my daughter. 

The receptionist called my daughter's class teacher who was present in the school at that time but when she was asked, the confusion in her eyes was tearing my heart.

"But Dr. Rahul, but Jolly has already left for home."
"Has left for home? What are you talking about? If she was at home , would I be here??" I asked with anger in my eyes.

That scene in which a middle aged person who was talking to my child and took her with him was stabbing my heart like dagger.

The receptionist immediately informed the police and the police came. After talking to the police I went home .. with the hope that the police would find the daughter..

But what about Prerna?? How will I tell her that some man has kidnapped her daughter. She will be in bad condition after crying, she loves her daughter more than meâ€¦ how will I face her??

Thinking all this, I reached my house while driving... When I reached home, Prerna's eyes lit up seeing me. Like it used to light up everytime she saw Jolly.

But my heart was crying out loud that how the girl on whom I have not got angry till today, whom I have not hurt till date. Today I was going to break her hope.
But maybe she understood by looking at my face.

 Seeing the traces of dry tears on my cheeks, she understood that her daughter was in some danger. She started screaming, and started asking about her daughter's condition.

But for the first time in my life, for the first time, I was crying with my head hanging in front of my Prerna.
Now 4 years have passed since that incidence.. The police could neither trace my daughter Jolly nor that man. 

Today my Jolly's case file must have either been gathering dust in one of their police stations or would have been used to burn in winter.

My Prerna went into depression ... she neither talks to anyone nor listens to anyone.
 She even gave up her medicine career, just sitting in the verandah of the house, waiting for her jolly.

And me?? I just became a helpless father and an incompetent husband who neither saved my daughter nor served my wife.

We started going to the therapist.. I wanted to see Prerna happy again.. again wanted to hear her laugh in my ears.
"Dr. Sharma, I can't feel the grif this is going through.. but I can understand the fear of losing my child. I am prescribing some medicines but they will be able to work only when there is hope in Prerna.Only you can give her that hope...
Try Going Somewhere For Vacation Some such place which is memorable for both of you." The therapist said.

Hearing this, my eyes lit up... I started remembering my and Prerna's camping days and hoped that maybe Prerna would be cured by this.

While carrying this hope in my heart and thanking the therapist i drived back home and started searching for a cabin in the woods, between the mountains , near a river and away from hustle and bustle of cities. 

I found a similar cabin and started packing.Prerna did not say yes to this trip, neither she denied.. It was making me feel like she doesn't even cares about her situation now.

I did the packing and we both went on our trip. While driving on the mountain roads, Prerna closed her eyes and started filling the fragrance of the mountains inside her. I saw a small smile on her face.

I started feeling happy that maybe this trip will be successful, maybe I can reduce the sadness of Prerna a bit.

We reached the cabin at 2 o'clock in the afternoon and after keeping all the belongings I started preparing to make lunch.

We both had lunch together and after that I gave Prerna her medicines and advised her to take rest for some time.

I thought while she rests, I'll go out and chop some wood as long as I have some more sunlight left..

When I went out with my axe and a handgun to rescue animals, the sun was almost setting and it was very late in the evening..

I went a little inside the forest and started chopping wood.. Only then I looked on the ground and I saw the signs of some animal which were very strange.

I am not an expert, but looking at those conclusions, one can say that they were not the mark of any normal animal.
The marks were in such a way that..

On the side of his back feet, there were marks of dog's feet but on the side of his front feet were the marks of human hands. 

I did not understand what I was seeing but still I did not thought much about it because I did not want to leave Prerna alone for long.

I cut wood and brought them to the cabin and kept it near the fire place. The sun had set completely and it was starting to get cold, so I lit a fire in the fire place and gave the cabin time to warm up. And then I started preparing to make dinner..

Prerna came out of the room while making dinner.
She was looking well rested after a long time because before that she was either not able to sleep or used to wake up with fear while she used to get some sleep.

Today for the first time he rested with aches and I was cursing myself that why I didn't do all this earlier. Prerna comes to me and smells the aroma of pasta and burgers being prepared .

"You have prepared food for me a lot of times but today we are back to the place where our relationship started and today the aroma of you food is smelling more sweet." She said with a slight smile on her face. 

It was the first time since last 4 years when My Prerna had said something which made me feel relaxed and satisfied instead of feeling guilt and sadness.

We both sat at the dining table and started having dinner and I was just enjoying the burger made by me that but suddenly I heard that voice in my ears, which once used to make my heart happy, but today I got goosebumps after hearing that voice.

"Daddy! Daddy where are you ?"

My eyes were tearing, my mouth stopped and there was no other sound in my ears except that voice.
"Daddy! It's getting too dark, it's getting too cold...
 please call me to you"  I was thinking that when  jolly's voice again hit my ears.

This is the voice of my jolly, my jolly has come back, I looked at Prerna with joy and shock, and saw that she was was already looking at me.

We both had tears in our eyes... Our lovely doll was back. 

But, then my heart sat down... Jolly is dead... So who was outside??

This can't be our jolly.

How can this be jolly?? 

I had killed Jolly, I went to Jolly's school that day in the car with my friend. 

I had myself called Jolly  from inside.. that's when she came in the car.

I took her to the forest and had cracked her thin neck with my own hands... she was crying a lot. 
"Daddy, daddy I'm scared... I have to go to momma... daddy I want to go to momma"

How could I let her go... She took my Prerna away from me.

She took away my Prerna from the time she came into our life...
My Prerna never pays attention to me, just jolly this and jolly that.

Prerna had stopped talking to me , she would never spend any time with me without Jolly. 
How could I leave her alive?

I broke her neck, the sound of a crackkkkk.. Her face was completely blue . Her little hands and feet were shaking for some time and then she was completely peaceful.

But how did she come back... I had done her last rites well... I had made her pyre and set it on fire.

I had also prayed for the peace of his soul... but how did it suddenly come back now?

I was still thinking that but suddenly there was a knock on the door of our cabin... Prerna got up to open the door. She had tears of happiness dwelling in her eyes. 
No no no no... I can't let Jolly back take my Prerna away from me. 

I made Prerna sit and walked out with my handgun... whatever it was now. Whether she was jolly or whether someone else . now I was not going to leave her alive. I was gonna put all my bullets in it's head.

I forgot to bring the flashlight in a hurry, but the moon was full that night and the moonlight was providing enough visibility.

The more I started moving towards that voice, the more that voice started moving away from me.

I kept walking but couldn't even get close to that voice .
"Daddy it's so scary... I want to go to mumma, daddy"  this was the same cry Jolly was crying on the day I killed her. 

Then I saw that a little girl was standing on the edge of the mountain.. Her neck was crooked and she was standing on the top of a cliff. When I went to her she was jolly... in her school dress.

But how is this even possible ? I burned her.
I was thinking about that and slowly approaching "Jolly" that suddenly i heard a pair of legs running towards me .

It was Prerna who came out of the cabin and came after me and she started running towards Jolly. I tried to stop Prerna but she did not stop.

And when she was near jolly then Jolly's bones started breaking, it seemed that all her bones were breaking, but she started growing even more in appearance. 
Gradually she transformed into a bizzare animal looking like creature ..

The creature had no face only two red eyes and two rows of sharp teeth .. There were human hands on him as fore limbs and dog's leg as hind limbs. It's legs were very toned and filled with grey hairs.

I started chasing prerna to stop her but to no avail . The monster had already grasped her by her neck and jumped down the cliff exposing his big feathery wings under his arms .. 

I tried to shoot it buf feared for the life of my Prerna if she was still alive .

I ran back to the cabin , called police ..

Police did came and started a search operation thinking that maybe Prerna fell from the cliff and I had a stress induced episode to cope with it.
But search was a complete fail.

Four weeks have passed now.

I am still living in the cabin and I tried going down the cliff to search for my Prerna.

But now my Prerna is calling me outside , occasionally knocking on the door .. I know that it is not my Prerna but still i am going outside in hopes to meet my Prerna again for one last time. 

I am posting this so that if by chance i get lucky and save myself and maybe my Prerna from that monster . I want you guys to tell me how can i avoid it ...
Please help me.

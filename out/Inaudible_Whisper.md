I work at a sketchy job, which is why I don’t feel comfortable sharing the details. The schedule is flexible, you get to choose what time u start and you work for nine hours, I always started working at around 6 am since I struggle with getting up early in the morning. A little more than a week ago I ended my shift at 4 am. Before I left the building I went to use the bathroom, as I was washing my hands I heard an inaudible voice, a whisper. At first, I didn’t think much of it, I even thought I was imagining it, which happens once in a while and I’ve always blamed it on my terrible sleeping schedule. but as I turned the water off I could hear it clearer, I stood and listened carefully, I was sure someone was whispering. I checked all the stalls and I was the only one there. For a minute or two, I stood there frozen, I tried following the voice but it was hard since whispers consisted of one or two words followed by long intervals and sometimes weeps. I’ll admit that I got a little scared so I slowly left. That night I kept thinking about what happened but it didn’t bother me I just felt curious, wondering where the voice was coming from but after that day I almost forgot about it and I wish it had stayed that way since what happened three days ago will terrify me for the rest of my life.

  On my way to work before I crossed the street, I noticed police outside the building, I’ve seen them there before since like I said It’s a sketchy job, so it wasn't unusual but this time cops were all over the place. they didn’t let me in, one of them asked me for my name and contact information, and said they’d call me in a few days and ask me some questions. I figured they were closing us down which sucked because I’d have to look for another job, but I was safe from any legal trouble, so I wasn’t worried that much. That night I checked the platform on which I and my colleagues shared information. Turns out the police didn’t shut us down because of the company’s illegal activities. They found a dead body inside the bathroom wall. It took me just a few seconds to remember the inaudible voice. One of my colleagues sent a picture of the dead body, he was still inside the wall, and he was almost green with foam coming out of his mouth and nose. seeing that picture made me feel physically sick, I even threw up twice. I haven’t slept for two days and I’m pretty sure I won’t be able to sleep this night either, the worst part is that sometimes for a second I hear those whispers and weeps and it’s driving me crazy. I don’t know if I should seek professional help.

 I swear I'm going crazy, I can't breathe. It all started two months ago when I was walking to the bus stop. I live alone at the end of a road surrounded by the forest, between my house and the main road is a cemetery. 
 
 This cemetery is hundreds of years old, in fact it is abandoned. No one visits the cemetery even the families of those buried there are long gone. 

 Everytime I need to walk past the cemetery to the bus stop I make it brief, it's creepy. On this particular day I needed to grab some groceries, as I'm walking by the cemetery I hear a bloodcurdling scream "HEELLLLPPPPP MEEE" at this point I'm booking it and not looking back, I don't fuck with the paranormal.

 On my way back from the grocery store, it's dark and I'm walking back to my house. I make it in safely and I didn't hear anymore screams. Almost a week goes by and no screaming. Until Friday, I was making my way to the bus stop, it's about 7 am. I'm walking by the cemetery and hear a little boy crying in a dry raspy voice "please someone, help me, I'm so scared." 
 
 I decide to walk into the cemetery, everything feels off, I feel like I'm being watched. I hear where the voice is coming from and I kneel next to his grave 'Jack L. Thompson, born: 1798 died: 1806' the poor boy was only 8, i say a prayer for him in my head and make my way to the grocery store. 

  I'm back home and still can't help but feel like I'm being watched. Weeks pass by and everytime i pass the cemetery I hear screams and cries of agony. I feel like I'm going crazy. 

 Then I hear it. A knock on my door. It's a man, he's in a panic. "Can you please help me with my car?" he pleaded. "I took a wrong turn and I.... I ended up next to this cemetery and I keep hearing screaming, I think the spirits are mad at me" he cried. I was in shock, I'm not crazy. "Alright, don't worry I'll get you out of here in no time" I gave him a reassuring smile.  I get my tools and we head down to his car.

 "Well, it's your tire, do you have a spare?" I asked. "I'll get it, thank you so much for helping me." he said. Then, we heard it, A womans voice screaming. "Oh no they're really mad." he says shakingly. He began to say a prayer. 

 He gives me the tire from his trunk, I put it on and go to put the damaged tire in his trunk. 

 I see a shovel with blood on it. I drop the tire as the impact from a wrench hits my head and sends needles running down my neck. I remember my knees hitting the ground.

 I'm awake, I swear I'm going crazy, I can't breathe. I'm screaming and crying for help, confined to this coffin.

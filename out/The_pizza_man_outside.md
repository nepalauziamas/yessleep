I was lying in bed next to my husband and we were watching tv, enjoying our time alone while our son, was with his grandmother.

My husband looked over at me, "Hey, we're home alone and you know what that means" I smiled realizing what he meant. All of a sudden we heard the doorbell ring. "Mother fucker, honey can you go see who it is."

I rolled my eyes annoyed and put my robe on and went downstairs, to see who it was. I opened the door to see a pizza man standing there. He looked to be in his late 20s and had greasy hair.

"Your pepperoni pizza, that you ordered ma'am."

I looked at him and said, "I didn't order a pepperoni pizza" he just stood there and said, "I think you did." I then got annoyed with this guy and told him "I would know if I ordered a pizza, so please leave" his smile faded as he walked away.

I went back upstairs to my husband and told him what had happened, and all he told me was "Come on, give the man a break it isn't easy working fast food." I got annoyed with my husband and told him I didn't feel like doing it anymore.

So I got back in bed with my husband and continued watching tv. About 10 minutes had gone by when we heard the doorbell ring again, and now I was wondering who it was this time.

"Can you get it this time, I got it last time."

But my husband begged me to get it saying he was too tired to get it. I moaned and got out of bed to get it again, but when I opened the door no one was there. I looked down and I saw a pizza box laying there, confused I brought it in.

I put it on the table and opened it just to see a piece of paper in it. It said "Confused, go upstairs" what did it mean by that? I thought my husband was playing a prank on me and went upstairs to confront him.

I opened the door and what I saw still haunts me to this day, the pizza man from earlier was standing there covered in blood and holding a butcher knife. He started at me with a big smile and I then looked down to see my husband was lying there bleeding out with stab wounds.

"How about that pepperoni pizza ma'am" I screamed and ran into the bathroom locking the door. I pulled out my phone and called 911, the man slamming on the door and screaming while I did it. "Let me in now!" 

The police finally arrived and I heard a commotion outside the door. I finally heard a voice "It's the police, open up" I smiled and opened the door for them. An officer was standing there, he asked if I was alright and I told him everything that happened. 

They finally took the man away and my dead husband who I grieved over and still grieve over to this day. But still to this day whenever I hear the doorbell ring late at night, I get scared remembering what happened that night.

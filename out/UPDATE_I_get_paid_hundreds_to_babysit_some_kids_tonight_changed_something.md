So I’m hiding because even if this is a prank they do not win, I am great at hiding from small children. I waved bye to the kids about eight fifty nine? Just to give me a minute ahead of the designated time. While I’m cramped in a box with my phone on silent I thought I should go more in depth on some things.

The kids have a ‘bell’ system, so when I said I call for them I really just ring this stupid bell. They know how to talk, I see them talking to children all the time, it’s just when the kids are older than them do they suddenly go quiet. There are three children, their triplets aged 13. Bit too old for a babysitter imo but I get paid and they don’t complain.

Anyways, I’m taking everyone's advice and hiding well. I know they are not allowed in the parents bedroom and going off the fact this house is so large the parents have their own wing of the house I’d say that's the safest place. But it’s also the farthest room from everything so hallway closet it is.

Oh about the parents, they have different houses for different things. Parties are held at the largest house, dinners at the fancier house and babysitting in this one. They travel the world for their unknown work and get home super early. They also, as far as I know, do not talk to their kids.

Someone mentioned masks I think? Honestly don’t know what those are but the hospitals have them? People don’t wear them anywhere unless they're sick and when they are forced to stay home. I tried texting my family because I’m bored but my phones being weird so my texts aren’t going through but Reddit is.

Dammit I had plans with someone once the kids went to sleep. I hope they don’t show up, the parents don’t like people they don't know in their house. My first weekend I spent here consisted of the parents watching from around the corners or off their high and mighty camera system that goes through the house. Outside of bedrooms, bathrooms and hallways, but not my closet. I’ve seen the surveillance room a couple times over the year and there's only a couple closets without cameras covering them.

Maybe this spot is a bad idea, but the kids have never been near the surveillance room so I should be okay? Damn I didn’t grab a weapon, any weapon would have been great tbh. I think I have pepper spray in my backpack in the living room. The living room isn’t too far. I don't doubt I’d make it without being tagged.

I don’t want to hurt the kids in case this is a prank or just a fun night.

Hold the fuck up

Hold everything I hear something outside in the hallway. I think they're calling my name? I don’t like this, any of this. I fucking hate this. It’s nine on the dot and they're calling my name. To that one person who said “maybe they can’t talk” fuck you- this is fucking spooky.

I’ll update if something happens, data is iffy so I’ll just continue on this post.

THEIR FUCKING SINGING WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK. I hate this, fuck everything. They’re not even singing in English, I think it’s Latin? Fucking Latin? I only know because Christian lessons I have to drop them off too sometimes.

I swear to everything if the closet door opens and they find me I might swing. Actually? I would swing, their singing louder and louder everytime the fucking ‘song’ continues.

I’m gonna google what it could be, maybe even read the one of the bibles in the box in the closet.

….. So nothing on the internet on what they're singing but I keep seeing news on towns that don’t exist and countries that don’t exist. I can’t find my hometown, my identity is gone and so are my friends.

I can’t find anyone, everyone I know is gone. Just fucking poof everything is gone, my profiles my photos my everything is gone and the god for saken fucking singing is getting louder.

They’re singing louder and I can hear them opening doors and searching rooms, they’re so loud.

Their so fucking loud I want to hurt them. I need a breather dear fucking lord.

I’m gonna run, see if I can go outside. Maybe I can run away and just forget this family exists and just start a new life? 

I’m gonna wait until they go to a different wing. Maybe I can talk about the family more? There isn’t much I know but I do know some things.

Okay so I did mention the last nanny, I looked her up before tonight some more and only found newspapers about her being admitted to some asylum that ‘totally isn’t for the insane’ kinda shit. The rich put their maids and nannies there when they see something they shouldn’t. Fuck that’s me isn’t it?

So I looked up my notes I keep on the family cause they pay me under the table and I don’t want my ass on the line and I don’t have at least a little blackmail. So the parents are super rich, like they own the town and most of the states. I can’t tell you why because I’ll have my head in someone's lake or something. They have me come to parties to look after the children during. I have seen them go into a room with people and leave alone. No one ever comes out of the room again, they just disappear. The children have killed every animal that makes noise, they HATE noise. It could be the very reason no one talks, like in public it’s okay to talk around them but the house seems to be their little playground.

The family has only had nannies that have little to no family, like me.

Shit I hear the kids leaving the wing, I’m gonna run to get a weapon and get the fuck out.

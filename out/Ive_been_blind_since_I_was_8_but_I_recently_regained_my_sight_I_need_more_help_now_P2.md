I’ve been blind since I was Eight, but I recently regained sight. I need more help, now. P2

Thank you all for your kind suggestions, I have taken them to heart. I know I left my situation on a cliffhanger, and I will explain

After seeing the body in the basement, I heard the door click open, and I ran. I have a laundry chute in my room, because going down the stairs is too risky. I immediately go to the back corner of the basement and find the emergency ladder rings for the chute, and climb up them to my room. I then jump into my bed and quickly fake sleeping.

Suddenly, my mother walked in.

“Precious. Simply Precious. It’s going over well.”

What was?, I asked myself. The second she left I opened the window and projectile vomited like crazy. That was disgusting and horrid. 

That’s where my story left off. Over the last day or two I pretended to still be blind, and I managed to gather more information. I am not Victor Williams to the public. I am under a different name, but I don’t know what, which reinforces the fact that they seem to have kidnapped me. I am officially in enemy territory, and I’m the target goal. But why do they keep me? 

The book I obtained is written in a strange codex that I can’t understand. But in my fathers room, his safe has a sheet of paper I always thought to be his Birth Certificate, but his is in my mothers room. So last night, I snuck in his room to obtain the paper. I cracked the lock and held the paper. It was a cheat sheet to the code. So I began reading it. 

As I translated it, I noticed two things. My vision is getting slowly better. And that by only reading the first few sentences, it’s a book of summoning. But what? I decide to check the basement again. I traveled down the rungs of the chute and lightly fall into the basket. I don’t dare go into that room again. 

But I notice a shelf with books on it. And they’re all the same copy as my book. Yet again, my mind clicked the same time as danger did. The books aren’t to summon something. The weirdest thing is, all the books have the exact same goddamn title, named the “Satyr’s Draft.” I think they are not the summoners, but the ones who ARE SUMMONED. The moment I realize this, I can hear from upstairs:

“Someone’s taken the Satyr’s Copy!”

“VICTOR!!”

I bolted through the basement window adjacent to the chute and made a run for the woods behind our house. I bolted to the woods and heard my family follow soon after.

“VICTOR, CHILD, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?! WHERE IS THE BOOK!”, my “sister” exclaimed. Wait, did she call me child? No matter, I have to bolt and get the hell out of here. I notice a bridge over a stream in the distance, and I dive for it. But as I look, there’s no leaves or open standing dirt holes to hide in.

“VICTOR? GIVE US THE BOOK! NOW!”, said the looming and booming voice of my father, who sounds fairly close. I quickly dig a small hole about my height and a couple inches into the dirt wall and press myself against the wall. Silence looms as my heart beats are so rapid, they sound like they auditioned for a Fast Rock band. Leaves crunch above me and I hear them stop at what I can only assume is somewhere close. 


Suddenly, they grow faster. Running, almost inhuman running. The two legs hitting turn into what sounds like four, and practically gallop away, sounding like a contorted human maraca. I peek my head over the creek, and my father is facing the trees adjacent to me, running. But he’s on all fours, and his limbs are sickly contorted, to the point where it looks like his bones are broken and something else is doing the running. 

He shambles away, not seeing me, and I nearly throw up, stopping on only a whim. They’ve revealed who they are, and they’re not afraid to show it. Wait, they are afraid, just unassuming. They… don’t know I can see. Even if they find me, they aren’t aware of my sight, and won’t suspect if I get lost. I take a small sigh of relief and slump over, and take a moment to think about what I’ve heard

They addresses the book I took as the Copy, not the Draft, as I saw lining the bookshelf. If the rest of them were issued as Draft, why is this one Copy? I decide to take the paper key from my pocket and translate. I open the book and look at what is presumably the Table Of Contents. 

There seem to be approximately 13 chapters. It takes a little bit, but I decode the chapter names. What I find is proof of Hell on Earth. “How to Expedite a successful sacrifice.” What the hell does that mean? But before my thoughts collect, a piercing scream shoots down the wooded trees. 

Instinctively, I slowly start to walk along the dirt wall and pray they don’t see me.

“FIND HIM! HE IS OURS!” My “father” bellows. Two other screams echo back. They are gonna kill me, and I’ll never know the true reason as to where the hell I am. No, not happening today. I silently trudge along the dirt wall, and far away enough to visibly see the water level increase. I never learned how to swim, so this could be the stupidest decision I have ever made. 


Nonetheless, fear keeps me going. I can still hear them scuttling about, screeching for me. Its apparent that they know what I’m trying to do, and there’s no point in trying to hide themselves. 

I decide to continue decoding the chapter names. One chapter in particular calls my attention. “How to make a portal to your home.” Who’s home? I read, and I finally learn whom I’ve been living under. The first sentence states, “You may want a way back to our master, but it is no easy task. Hell waits for no one.” My heart gallops a mile in my rib cage and I start to slowly sink to the ground. I look up to the sky. I expect to see a welcoming evening sunlight and a brisk breeze. What I get, is my sister staring down at me, smiling a hellish grin.  

She lunges at me, and I kick her away, and she falls into the water. I use the confusion as a chance to escape as she tumbles through the water. (She was never very good at swimming)

“HELP ME, YOU WORTHLESS SHIT!”
She said as she drowned. No humane tone of voice could produce the undertone she made. I ran after that, because that was loud as hell. I’m currently hiding in a dead log, at 12:47. I hear my parents getting closer every second. Someone, please help me. I’ve been raised by demons

For obvious reasons, I'm calling myself "Blue" throughout this post. As well all other names will be disguised accordingly.

&#x200B;

It's pretty easy for somebody to judge another they haven't even met, based off context-less actions. I don't need your sympathy, and I'm not arguing that I haven't done some very messed up things. I try to be a good guy, live by some basis of morality and fairness, but sometimes we can't always be who we want to be. Just gonna start out with a little backstory then we'll move on into it.

&#x200B;

I live in an undisclosed major city in the US, got its nice areas and less ones so. Grew up in one of the lesser nice neighborhoods, just did what we had to do. Eldest of five siblings, took care of each other pretty much. Dad was a fair enough fella, little heavy on the drink but he never touched any of us so can't complain. Mom went missing when I was 10, no idea if she ran off or something bad happened or what. Sometimes you just gotta accept and live with these things.

&#x200B;

All that though ain't important. We all grew up with family, made sure we all ate and kept the others in line. Being the oldest, that responsibility was mostly on me, but we all pulled our weight. Got two brothers, "Red" and "Orange", and two sisters, "Cyan" and "Violet". Youngest is Cyan, good girl, less involved in what we all got going. Next is Orange, simple kid, chases girls a little much but he's got a good heart. Then Violet, quiet type 'till you get her mad, then Hell ain't gonna get much left of you. And my oldest brother Red.

&#x200B;

Red is the more complicated one. He's got a lot going for him, but doesn't seem to realize it. Took to drugs like a fly on shit, and pisses money like water. We had a conflicting relationship, but as the two oldest we had to suck it up.

&#x200B;

As we all got a little older, we did what we needed. Tough neighborhood in an unforgiving city. Cliche, but that's how a lot of us are I guess. We kept our own lives, but we all ended up in the same sorta businesses, you see. Just worked a lot better for all of us if we did it together with people we semi trusted. Except Cyan, she always still tried to get out of this place. She still helped out with some jobs, but she held some hope that she'd be able to go to school and have the nice life. Sad as shit to think back on now.

&#x200B;

Anyways we're into all sorts of games out here, drugs, theft, loansharking, gambling. It's got a sentence attached, you bet we're into it. Well I was in a cell for a little thing I got caught with, still missing a year ago when I would've been charged as a minor, when I noticed this kid I knew down the street.

&#x200B;

He was talkin' all sorts of big game, loud mouth type, when he mentioned how "As soon as I get out, I already got a place in mind. Big empty house with too much glitter all over it to pass up."

&#x200B;

I laughed at him from across the yard, "Bull," I called.

&#x200B;

"It ain't. Big old house down \*\*\*\*\*\* Street. You've seen it, can't miss it."

&#x200B;

"How the hell you gonna get in that?" I mocked at him.

&#x200B;

"Like I'd tell you!" he said with some attitude. I stayed silent after that.

&#x200B;

We needed money pretty bad. Well just so happened we got out at around the same time. Lucky me. Ain't gonna go into details but we got the idea of what he knew. 

&#x200B;

So I met with all the degens back at the house after dad was in a drunken stupor, and told them about the heist I conjured up. Big old haunted manor without all the ghosts. Richies with no care if a couple street kids took a little of what they had. And plenty they supposedly had. We all got in the "board room" and devised us a little plan.

&#x200B;

"So, big old place down \*\*\*\*\*\* Street. Big open windows and nobody home the whole week. Source said we can go for something like six grand probably."

&#x200B;

"Who's the source?" Red said from across the table.

&#x200B;

"Trustable, don't worry about it," I told him.

&#x200B;

"Well I'd like to worry about it, that's how you just caught your third on the wrap sheet," he said with his typical passive-aggressive tone.

&#x200B;

We'd always be the two butting heads at every job. Every source I had was questioned and every idea had some hole poked through it.

&#x200B;

"'Eddy' down the way, like I said, don't worry about it," I told him, raising my voice.

&#x200B;

"Eddy? You call that trustworthy?" he questioned.

&#x200B;

Violet was practically hiding in her chair, when Cyan peeked up from her homework.

&#x200B;

"Hey guys, relax. I'm sure Eddy had his sources too, sure he blows it up but he always does have some leads," she remarked.

&#x200B;

Whenever things got heated between us, Cyan would always be peacemaker. She was really the glue that held things together in our family.

&#x200B;

"Look, I made sure it was a good job, just trust me on this one. I have a good feeling about it," I said trying to defuse.

&#x200B;

Red sat back in his folding chair, crossing his arms and putting on a frown.

&#x200B;

"Alright fine, but that gut better not be full of shit, Blue."

&#x200B;

We talked back and forth about specifics and details down to the steps. Cyan would be driver since she hated going inside on jobs and just got her learner's. Violet would crack the windows and anything with protection, she was smaller built so she could get in easier without doing as much damage. Red would watch outside for any weird activity going on. Orange would come inside with me and search.

&#x200B;

Orange came in late from a girl's place, which gets really tiring after a while, but we ran it by him.

&#x200B;

Well the day rolls around and we head out toward the house. It was *big*. Most houses around us are either trailers or crack den apartments, but not this one. It was in the nicer side of town, so we already stuck out like a bunch of sore thumbs. Still, we made it over without too much fuss.

&#x200B;

The place had a big kempt yard, trimmed bushes, grass so low it was better running on than turf, and a long gravel driveway. This made it more difficult to get over without dragging attention, but like I said we were damn good at planning. We noticed the yard narrowed around the sides, so with Cyan and the car parked a block down, we made our way to the fence and hopped over. Red peeked his head over quickly to make sure the place was clear before we crossed the yard.

&#x200B;

Violet used her crowbar to pry open the window we were tucked under. There was nobody home to hear the subtle crack of the mechanism that locked it.

&#x200B;

With Red stationed outside, the three of us jumped through. We found ourselves in a big room with wooden carved walls and floors. Massive red curtains draped the windows and there was a big fancy leather couch with a TV. It looked like a living room but incredibly pretentious.

&#x200B;

Orange hopped on the couch and giggled to himself.

&#x200B;

"What the hell are you doing?" I asked him in a whisper.

&#x200B;

"*I'm gonna let you peasants do all the work, ma ha ha*," he said in a posh British impression.

&#x200B;

Violet giggled, but I gave him a stern look and told him, "Your talking too damn loud, let's get busy here."

&#x200B;

We searched the house all over, taking anything we could. The place was filled with high dollar stuff. Fancy smancy littered the whole vibe. This family was supposedly that of a local politician, shitty one at that. They were on vacation or something, Eddy heard about it from a girl he was tryin' to bang. This guy definitely used taxpayer money wisely, though, to have this kind of place. Whole house was pretty easy to go through with about half the score we were promised, which Eddy will surely hear about. The one spot with a problem was one room down red carpeted stairs.

&#x200B;

It had a big fancy lock on it. One that didn't look like it was meant to be opened. I called Violet over.

&#x200B;

"This looks like something heavy duty, something important. Think you could pop that open?" I asked.

&#x200B;

She responded with a nod and started to work. This is where our excellent planning skills didn't end up helping us.

&#x200B;

I looked out the window to check on Red, when I noticed him slouched over.

&#x200B;

I knocked at him, but no response.

&#x200B;

I knocked again, but harder. He jumped up at attention. His sleeve was rolled up and he immediately stuffed something in his pocket. I didn't have to be a genius to put two and two together. I gave him the nastiest look I could and was about to yell, when I heard a click from downstairs and Violet gasp.

&#x200B;

I moved fast downstairs, ready to snatch what was there and make our way out, when I saw Violet stood still and stiff.

&#x200B;

I made my way to her, she was facing the cracked open door. The foulest smell hit my nose and I knew it from somewhere I didn't want to know. I opened the door to look inside.

&#x200B;

By this point Orange was peaking around the corner of the stairwell.

&#x200B;

"What is it guys? A big score?"

&#x200B;

He made his way down and immediately frowned when he smelled the same thing I did. He looked inside with us.

&#x200B;

All of our eyes were glued wide open when we saw it. The room was a vault filled with the family's valuables. All of them, spare the ones we took. They were all crammed into the room we stared in. Along with Eddy and the family.

&#x200B;

They were completely mangled. Like an animal tore them apart. Written in blood and entrails, spelled out, "***FOUND WHAT YOU WERE LOOKING FOR?***"

&#x200B;

The three of us sprinted out of the house, smashing the window and snatching Red. We ran to the car, all stealth left us as soon as we saw that visage. Red and Cyan kept asking us what the hell happened, but none of us said a word other than "Drive".

&#x200B;

We got back to the house and hunkered down. All the windows were shut and the doors locked tight. We still didn't speak, none of us could. We had a very light payoff, but that was the least of our worries. Even Orange was usually the one to bring up the mood, but that was well out of his ability. We all just sat there throughout the day, and to the middle of the night. Red was high as a kite and Cyan was scared about what went wrong. She had no idea. We all went into the same room that night and shut every light.

&#x200B;

But then there was a knock at the door.

&#x200B;

It couldn't have been anyone nice this time of night, so I grabbed the strap we kept in the nightstand. Red couldn't keep his head up, let alone defend himself. Orange had a big bowie knife, and Violet a baseball bat. Cyan hid somewhere I couldn't see.

&#x200B;

They knocked again.

&#x200B;

We all closed in at the door, aimed and ready to pounce, when we heard a voice from the other side.

&#x200B;

"Hey, kids. It's dad," he said stuttering and drunken.

&#x200B;

"Can ya open up the door?"

&#x200B;

We all sighed and lowered our guard.

&#x200B;

"Hang on," I told him. We all hid our weapons as I reached for the door.

&#x200B;

Then something made a crash, followed by a sloshing wet sound. There was the sound of a short struggle.

&#x200B;

We grabbed our weapons again and I opened the door.

&#x200B;

"Wait!" said Violet, a second too late.

&#x200B;

I opened the door to a bloody mess. Our father lied there ripped open. His whole stomach was torn apart, exposing his cracked ribs and organs strewn across the yard. At his feet was a silhouette of a person.

&#x200B;

They stepped forward and I shot. *Miss*.

&#x200B;

He grabbed my arm and jerked my gun to the ground. Orange lunged at him with his bowie knife. As he did, the man grabbed him by the throat and popped his head off clean.

&#x200B;

Violet watched in absolute horror, frozen still.

&#x200B;

It looked at her and began to approach. I quickly grabbed Orange's knife and stabbed it through their abdomen. There was a pained, feminine screech.

&#x200B;

The woman turned, her mask shimmering into my eyes through the dim light. She punched me like she was a professional boxer, sending my feet above my head. Before I even hit the ground he slammed my chest into the tile.

&#x200B;

Before she could do anything else, Violet was already smashing her with her bat, rage piercing through her brown eyes like a bullet. The woman was staggered until she grabbed the bat. I was glued to the floor, helplessly watching as she snatched it out from her clutches and beating her with it.

&#x200B;

She turned her attention to me. I tried to sit up, but I felt the hard aluminum hit my head like a train. The rest of the beating was foggy, I remember my stomach and chest being beaten mercilessly.

&#x200B;

She threw it to the ground, clawing my face open. I remember my jaw being split away from my skull, when Violet tried her hardest to stop her.

&#x200B;

"I'll fucking kill you! Get off of him! Get away!" she cried.

&#x200B;

It was useless as the masked woman flew a punch straight to her chest and she flew to the ground. The woman began stomping her back until Violet stopped moving.

&#x200B;

She turned back to me, nearly dead. But then I heard Cyan sobbing from inside.

&#x200B;

The woman flew her head back, her eyes searching relentlessly for the source of the sound from behind that mask. She turned the house upside down, but Cyan stayed quiet as I bled onto the floor.

&#x200B;

Eventually the sound of sirens could be heard. As consciousness faded from my mind, I saw the figure take one last look at me and kneel down.

&#x200B;

"*I'll be back for you, and your sister. I'm gonna clean this whole city up one drop of blood at a time*."

&#x200B;

And then I woke up in a hospital bed.

&#x200B;

The police only showed up because of our little break in. They heard about suspicious activity from our rapid escape and went to find a basement of corpses. They followed the plates from a nearby CCTV camera and found us, but that's not their concern now. They're more worried about the vigilante that's been savagely massacring crooked politicians and lowly thugs. They're worried about the inhuman strength that woman had when killing my brother, paralyzing my sister, and leaving me unable to speak again.

&#x200B;

Red didn't hear a goddamn thing, and as much as I want to be filled with rage at the thought of him, I've seen the way he is when he comes in. I know this is something that's gonna plague his mind. Cyan wasn't hurt, but she's apparently gone into a sort of psychosis. She's gonna take a long time to recover from the trauma of that night. I was in a coma for a couple years, it took a lot for them to stitch me back together. That and my father is dead, so all of us are really on our own now.

&#x200B;

It's gonna be a hard life now for all of us, with that night on our mind and these scars to show for it. I guess don't get involved in crime, kids. If I could speak, I would tell you that. I would tell you that if you think you can get away with anything at all, she knows, and she will make you regret it. She's a vicious demon more than a superhero. I still see that mask in the windows of my hospital room. Sometimes a little too vividly. I know she's watching me.

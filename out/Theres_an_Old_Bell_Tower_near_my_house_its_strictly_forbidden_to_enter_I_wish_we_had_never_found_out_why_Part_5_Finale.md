Part 5.

Brian pressed the blade into Dennis' neck almost to the point of breaking the skin.

'What? Wh-what the fuck are you doing? That's not real, that's not me!' Dennis stuttered as he panicked.

I could see him visibly shaking.

Ash and Shawn took a few steps back up the stairs towards me.

Brian grabbed Dennis by the collar and threw him to the ground, knife still pressed to his neck.

'I knew it!' He said, 'I knew there was something weird about the way you were acting!'

'Brian, I swear! I never took that picture, I swear!'

'Shut up! Where's Dennis? What's happened to him?' There was pure aggression in Brian's voice.

'I am Dennis, I never took that photo you need to believe me, that wasn't me!' Dennis did sound like he was genuinely panicking.

But we had heard it all before.

'What does this mean?' Ash asked sheepishly, looking terrified.

'It means Dennis has been taken, whatever that thing is that had me up the stairs, it has Dennis too. This isn't the real Dennis and we need to get as far away from it as quickly as possible'. I took another step back, I was now back on the second floor, looking down.

Brian was still on the last couple of steps holding Dennis with the knife to his throat. 

He was in a huge fit of rage I had never seen from him before as he screamed in Dennis' face. 'Fucking leave us alone, let us leave, just let us leave and we'll never come back!!' 

Dennis pleaded with him. 

'Please Brian, you need to listen to me man, I'm... I'm me, I never took any photo, what the fuck would I even use to take a photo?' 

'He has a point, to be fair' Ash piped up. 'Where would he have gotten a Polaroid camera from?'

'What he used to take the photo is irrelevant, the polaroid itself is significant, not how it came to be' I informed him.

Ash looked at me confused.

As we watched the struggle between Brian and Dennis, I could see a dark silhouette slowly climbing the ladder.

My heart stopped.

Messy, wild colourful hair, on a pure chalk white face, two tiny glowing red eyes like lasers trained on us, the dripping red paint around the mouth, jagged, stained teeth formed a menacing grin.

I could see the familiar baggy, black and white checkered suit stained red with blood.

'Welcome to hell children!' 

The shrill voice made my bones itch.

I could see Brian partially release Dennis as he watched the clown still climbing the ladder, making it's way up.

Dennis slid from under Brian's grasp and backed away, Ash and Shawn stepped back some more, Shawn tripped and fell but never took his eyes off the advancing clown.

'Wh-what is that? What's going on?' Shawn stammered, sliding back, kicking rubble as his feet slid on the ground.

The clown moved in a jerking fashion, its gaze alternated between us all, then met my eyes, I looked away, I was speechless.

One hand on the crumbled first stair, Brian was still frozen.

The clown grabbed his leg and began to pull Brian over, Brian tried to pull himself back up but couldn't grip onto anything.

The clown laughed and tugged at his leg.

I snapped into action, I carefully ran down the remaining stairs and grabbed Brian's hand.

'Someone grab a knife or something' I screamed to the top of the stairs.

The clown repeated its phrases over and over again as its head shook and its hand pulled.

They were still just standing at the top watching.

'Did anyone hear me? Fucking help!' I screamed again.

I saw Dennis coming down with my knife in his hand.

My heart sank a little, I wasn't too sure how this would play out.

He reached me, and took another two steps down until he was level with Brian's head.

I closed my eyes as Dennis raised the knife.

I heard frantic hacking sounds and ear piercing screams.

I opened my eyes.

Dennis had almost chopped the clown's arm off.

He brought the large blade down 2 or 3 more times and the clown almost fell backwards as Brian was quickly released.

Brian made a swift move forward and booted the clown in the face.

'Fucking, fucking clown!' He cried, his voice shaking with fear and anger.

I peered over the edge.

The clown was gone.

It's arm remained with a tight grip on Brian's leg but the clown was completely gone.

'Get this thing off me' Brian said as he desperately pulled at the severed arm.

'Everyone, just get down, get down and get out of here, now' Brian commanded, we all obeyed.

We climbed down the ladder, Brian went first, then I went, happy to not fall off this time, Dennis next and as we bolted for the door Dennis held the ladder steady for Ash and Shawn.

The front door was closed but I could see cracks of light through the splintered wood, I couldn't get out of there fast enough

We almost fell in a heap as we scrambled through the door.

Ash emerged and fell immediately to the grass.

Then Shawn, who stopped at the threshold and looked back to Dennis.

There was an almighty clatter of metal from inside, it sounded like the ladder.

'Dennis!' Shawn yelped as he darted back inside.

Ash looked shocked! He got up and looked inside to see what was going on.

'Oh my God, Dennis!' He said, as he disappeared back into the building.

Brian and I approached the doorway cautiously. 

We could see them moving around, picking Dennis up off the ground.

10 or 15 seconds later, Ash and Shawn came walking out with Dennis hanging over their shoulders.

'The ladder fell and smacked his head' Shawn said.

Dennis had blood soaked hair with some more dribbling down his face.

'He can't drive then, someone grab his keys' Brian said, holding out his hand.

Ash fumbled around in one of Dennis' pockets and produced a car key.

We found the slit in the fence and let Ash and Shawn manoeuvre Dennis through. 

I could feel eyes on me from somewhere, I didn't feel threatened, I just felt like I was being watched.

I turned and looked the old bell tower up and down, I vowed to myself, I will never return to this place.

As my gaze reached the top, in one of the arches.

Liam sat on the stone ledge, watching us.

He looked exactly like I remembered him from five years ago.

I waved up at him.

He didn't respond.

He looked sad.

My gut wrenched seeing him looking normal again, I felt crippling guilt.

Brian looked at me as I was holding my hand up, 'what you doing?' He said as he turned and looked up.

'It's Liam' I replied, looking to see his reaction. 

Brian looked, and I looked back, but he was gone.

Barely a word was spoken in the car, Ash, Shawn and Dennis sat in the back, I sat in the front and Brian drove.

He dropped the guys at Shawn's house and assured Dennis he would drop me off and return the car before walking home.

Dennis didn't seem to care, they were all too quick to get out of the car and rush into Shawn's house.

The sun was low in the sky, the light burned my eyes, it felt nice driving with the window down, the air cooled my face and made me feel better.

My body and my mind felt exhausted.

'Never again!' Brian said, it was the first thing he had said the whole journey.

'Definitely, never again' I replied, I really meant it, I would never even set foot within the perimeter of that fence.

Brian pulled up to my house and parked.

He looked at me, he wanted to say something but couldn't.

I could see sadness in his eyes.

'Liam's never coming back, we need to accept that and move on'. He said eventually.

'I know, I just hate carrying that guilt with me everywhere, every day!'

Brian put his hand on my shoulder 'I know Danny, I do too, but we'll get through it man, always stick together no matter what' 

I nodded.

I got out of the car and Brian drove away.

Nobody seemed to be home so I went in, got some water and went to my room to lie down.

I needed to have a bath or something to help with the pains all over my body, but I was just too tired.

I was watching a TV program called Still Game, I wanted something funny to try and take my mind off everything.

Before I knew it, I must have blacked out at some point. 

It was night time, the TV was about 12 episodes ahead of where I last remember.

I had a couple of text messages and a few missed calls from Brian.

The first one was from 4 hours ago, it read, 'Just dropped the car off at Shawn's, tried to see how Dennis was doing but they wouldn't answer the door. On my way home now. Hope you're alright mate.' 

The next message from only 30 minutes ago said, 'tried phoning a few times, are you okay Danny?'.

I should probably phone him.

Something tapped my window.

'Tap'

...

I froze.

...

'Tap'

It happened again...

...

'Tap'

'Tap'

...

I was scared stiff.

My phone buzzed.

Another text from Brian.

It was probably him trying to get my attention at the window.

I picked my phone up and walked over feeling a little more relaxed.

.

Brian wasn't there.

Illuminated by the dim street light.

Three figures stood in the road, staring up at my window.

I could just make out who it was.

Ash.

Dennis. 

And Shawn.

Their slightly distorted faces all stared right at me, beckoning me down. 

Their glowing yellow eyes held my gaze.

I shuddered.

I was startled when my phone started ringing.

Brian was phoning me.

I put the phone to my ear without saying anything, I couldn't think of any words.

'Danny, something weird as fuck just happened, I'm gonna try and come round to yours man, I don't want to be by myself'. Brian sounded frantic.

'Don't!' I said.

'What?'.

'Don't, Brian' I repeated.

He was silent for a while.

'Are, are they there too?' He asked quietly, stuttering.

'They're here'.

'Shit, how is that possible, I'm looking at them right now, out my window' Brian said sounding absolutely bewildered, 

I couldn't understand it myself, they were at his house too? 

My train of thought was interrupted by Brian talking.
'What's going on man, how did this happen?' He continued, I couldn't tell if he was asking me directly or asking himself rhetorically.

'I don't know' I said, 'but we shouldn't go anywhere near them, just stay inside!'.

I heard the bells coming from Brian's end through the phone speaker.

Brian sighed, 'Do you hear that?' 

'I hear it but only through the phone'.

'I need to go man, I'm putting my headphones in, sick of hearing they fucking bells!' Brian sounded almost hysterical and quickly hung up before I could even say goodbye.

'Don't go outside!' I quickly shouted down the phone, just to remind him, whether he heard me or not I couldn't tell you.

When the line went dead I could still hear the bells, they gradually got louder.

I glanced out the window once more.

They were still standing there, waving me down.

No fucking chance!

.

.

It's been just over a week now and every night they come.

Every single night the bells ring at midnight and without fail they are outside my house.

Sometimes Liam's with them, sometimes not.

I haven't spoken to Brian in a while.

I'm just hoping, praying, that I don't look out one night and he's joined them.

I should probably phone and make sure he's okay and remind him not to go outside.

[There was an argument.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/wecmqh/i_found_a_life_size_doll_inside_the_walls_of_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

But we did wind up sleeping in the truck. We pulled our guest twin mattress out and laid in the back. It wasn’t comfortable, but it was better than being inside. 

Even in the back of the truck I still didn’t feel safe. Not as long as that doll was somewhere nearby. I slept facing the door, and barely got any rest at all. 

Especially because we had a lot on our plate in the AM. 

And it all went to shit anyway because Macie’s phone died overnight and she overslept and so our day started off on the wrong foot. 

I opened up the truck door and heard her on my phone explaining to her boss she would be an hour late because of the issue and immediately knew she was going to take her frustrations out on me. 

“Your dad was supposed to meet us at the truck rental place, yeah?” I asked as I dragged the guest mattress back to the front lawn and she finished her phone call. 

“I’m texting him now,” she muttered. 

“Tell him to come here and get you to work. I can take care of the truck,” I told her. 

“And how are you going to get back here? It’s halfway across town,” Macie commented. 

“I still have a bus pass,” I told her. She whipped out my phone again and texted her dad, making the change. Immediately I saw her relax. 

“Thanks babe,” she said as she turned to me and I shrugged my shoulders. Then she hugged my neck, which surprised me. 

When it comes to affection, I’m always the one to initiate. This was not like her. But we had just been through one hell of a night so I was glad to see she was letting her guard down. 

“You should probably go,” she said as she checked the time and passed my phone back to me. 

“No, you keep it. I can charge yours when I get back, the power should be turned on by then,” I told her. We hugged again and I swung myself up into the driver’s side of the u haul. 

Truth be told I could have just ran in to grab a phone charger. But I didn’t want to. I didn’t feel comfortable going anywhere near the duplex again until I was with someone. Something was wrong about it, or rather… everything was. 

Instead I padded my time taking the truck back and running odd errands. I didn’t have a bus pass, I was making sure I didn’t have to rush home. I was doing anything in power to make an excuse. 

Eventually though I ran out of those and I was getting hungry. Since I’d given the neighbor the last of my cash, going back wasn’t avoidable any longer. 

First though I went to the main office to grab our mail key. The landlord’s wife snatched it from her collection on the wall and slid it through the service window, casually asking, “How are you enjoying our home?” 

I thought about telling her the strange problems we were having. I even considered that her and her husband might actually already be aware. 

But instead I just smiled and took the key, telling her everything was fine. 

I could tell from her blank expression it was the only answer she cared for anyway. 

Next I went to the community mailbox and cleaned out everything that was still in there, skimming through it as I approached our front steps. 

Then I looked up and noticed that our door was wide open. 

Immediately my heart was pumping faster and I thought about the doll. It was back. 

I held the unsorted mail in a bundle, a makeshift weapon just to protect myself as I stepped in our place and took a look around. Thankfully the power was on at last, but I still didn’t feel completely at ease. 

Placing the papers down I listened and heard something coming from the bathroom. I reached for a kitchen knife and walked toward the door. 

Squeezing it tight, I reached for the handle and then saw it turn by itself. 

A flood of adrenaline filled me as I raised the knife in defense and then saw a woman step out, her eyes widening in shock as we both screamed bloody murder at each other. 

I kept the knife in my hands and took a step back. “Don’t come any closer!” 

“Who are you? Where’s Rose?” she asked frantically. She sounded even more scared than I did. 

“Who the fuck is Rose?” I shouted. 

“She lives here! I live here actually. I’m Sarah, her roommate. Now who the fuck are you??” she snapped back. 

I kept my distance from the stranger, none of her story adding up. 

“The landlord said the place hasn’t been occupied for a couple of months,” I said. 

“Aye, I’ve been on holiday visiting family in Australia. Just got back,” she muttered. “So wait. What the fuck? They sold the place?” 

“Show me your itinerary,” I whispered. 

“What?”

“I said show me your fucking flight plan. You had to have had plane tickets or shit like that right??” I snapped, still holding the knife straight at her. 

“Okay okay, calm down. I don’t have that but I have proof I live here, right here,” she said, sliding her phone across the floor. 

I reached down and picked it up, scrolling through the pics of her and the previous owner together. It suddenly registered that I had seen her face in the pictures. 

“All right… let’s say I believe you,” I said, passing her phone back to her and relaxing a bit. 

“When was the last time you talked to your roommate?” 

“I don’t know? A few days maybe. I booked a flight from Melbourne straight here,” Sarah answered. 

“A few days?” I looked over toward the pile of mail. 

“You’re sure?” I asked. 

“Yeah. Now can you please put that thing away?” she muttered. 

I fumbled with the knife, placing it back in the drawer and then sliding my hands in my pockets. 

“Sorry… it’s just. Well it’s been crazy.”

“Sure… I guess I would freak out too if I found a stranger in my place,” she paused and looked around the house a bit. “And here I thought she redecorated. So you got rid of all of her stuff then?” 

“The landlord insisted that she hadn’t been here for a while, and the place looked deserted,” I said. All of the mail agreed with me. There were overdue bills, collection notices, even a reminder to renew her license. Everything indicated that Rose had not been home in quite some time. 

“Why would she lie to me?” Sarah asked as she walked to the bedroom. I followed, keeping my distance. Despite her story checking out, I wasn’t ready to fully trust her. 

“Did she say she was still here?” I asked. 

“Yes… we talked almost every night, nothing out of the ordinary,” Sarah paused as she looked toward the vent. The same one that had freaked me out the night before. 

“Did you find anything… peculiar while you were moving in?” she asked. 

Like a six foot fucking sentient doll? I thought to myself. But no. I needed to play the long con and figure out what she knew. 

“Like what?” I asked casually. 

“It’s.. probably nothing,” she said as she casually reached down and scooped up the loose screw. 

“Your roommate is missing. That isn’t nothing,” I responded. 

“And I guess I don’t have a place to live,” Sarah said with a smirk as she pocketed the screw. 

“Well I’m sure you could probably stay here a few days with us. My partner is always at work, so I could use the company.” Damn it, I realized that was a bad move to tell a complete stranger. Why was I always so damn trusting? I thought. 

She smiled. “I appreciate the offer. But I saw that Mister Bill still lives next door so I guess I’ll pass,” she commented and then added, “You know the guy killed his wife and daughter right? Or did the landlord skip over that little detail too?” 

I was speechless and stood completely still to see if she was joking. She wasn’t. 

Sarah whistled softly and commented, “Wow. I will take that as a no.”

Then she clapped her hands together and remarked, “Got anything to eat? We can discuss it over lunch.” 

Too intrigued and terrified to know more, I accepted her offer.

As I made us sandwiches, Sarah told me the story. 

“This was probably right after I moved in here. Rosie’s old roommate had gotten married and she couldn’t afford rent alone. As it so happened, I just came to the states and needed a place to stay. Two peas in a pod eh?” 

I poured myself a glass of water and then she continued her story. 

“Bill and his wife Andrea were always arguing. I mean fucking always. We could hear it. These walls are paper thin. We could hear them fucking when they made up to each other. And when he decided to go ballistic and knock her around,” she whispered. 

Slowly I spread Mayo on my sandwich, enraptured by her tale. 

“Anyway, one night it’s the same as usual. He’s yelling. She’s running. Their daughter Penny is crying. Rosie’s had enough. ‘I’m going to go over there and give him a piece of my mind god damn it,’ she said. We’d already called the police dozens of times before. Same old same old. ‘I tripped,’ Andrea would say. Shit like that. It was a shame.”


“She was a beautiful young lady. Probably better looking than either of us if I’m being honest. And Bill was insanely jealous. He works nights. You know that. Always gone. Always sure she would have men over. She didn’t of course but you couldn’t convince him of that. Probably just projecting his own insecurity.” 

“So this night, this fucking fateful night; Rose goes over to talk to them. And she slams on the door at the exact moment that he was about to toss a lamp at Andrea. He said he was aiming for the wall. That fucking distracting knock? It made him flinch. And the lamp slammed right into Andrea’s head.” 

“Rose saw it had happened just as the door opened. She had a key to their place somewhere. Andrea had given it to her. She told us how often she wanted to leave. Wanted to take Penny and just get out of there. We told her to. God damn we told her to just run and never look back.”  

I had stopped spreading the Mayo. I was just listening now. Listening to the most tragic and frightening thing I had ever heard. 

“So there Rose was. Standing there. Looking down at Andrea as she bleeds out, shards of glass in her face and neck and eyes. She reaches for her phone but Bill snatches it away. 

“No, he says. They’ll lock me away. They’ll take Penny from me,’ he explains. He promises he’ll call 911 the second that Rose leaves. Claim it was all just an accident. And Rose? She believes him. I wish I knew why but she does.”

“The next day comes and goes and Rose decides to check on Andrea. Make sure everything is okay. Bill invites her over, tells her Andrea has made a full recovery and takes her to their bedroom to see for herself.” 

“And Andrea is there all right. Same blue eyes. Same golden blonde hair. Same hourglass shape. Human perfection is what she is. But she isn’t a human at all. Not anymore. What Rose is seeing is a doll. A life size replica that looks exactly like Andrea.” 

“A doll,” I repeated as my voice cracked, my mind going a mile a minute as Sarah finished the story. 

“Somehow he got it done at work. That stuff they use for embalming corpses? Yeah. Keeps the skin fresh. And he made a fucking doll out of her. Rose wasn’t the same after that. Truth be told neither of us were.” 

The room was dead silent as I mulled over everything she had said. 

“You… you said his daughter was killed too?” 

“As far as I know. I mean she literally disappeared the same night so two plus two equals four. Of course because Rose didn’t call the cops the second it all happened there was no case. Everyone just assumed Andrea ran off and took Penny with her,” she said. 

“That’s… that’s insane,” I admitted. My body felt numb. Her story explained a lot, but there were still so many holes. Things that didn’t make sense. 

“That doll was here when we moved in, in a closet behind a fake wall,” I told her. 

Immediately Sarah’s eyes widened in alarm. “Shit it’s here! Where?” 

So she knew something about it, I realized as I reached for the charger and plugged in Macie’s phone. Now we were getting somewhere. 

“I think Bill moved it last night. We asked him to help get it out and I haven’t seen it since then,” I admitted. 

“Wouldn’t surprise me if he found a way to get it back to his place without you realizing it. Bill was obsessed with that thing. Probably used it as a sex toy if I’m being honest. He treated it like she was alive,” Sarah said. 

“Funny. He said that Rose did the same thing. Made it sound like she was the crazy one,” I commented. 

“He would do that eh? Fucking jackass,” she scoffed. 

“But it was here though, sealed away in this apartment. Why would he do that?” I asked. 

Macie’s phone began to buzz urgently as soon as it gained power. 

“Must be your babe,” Sarah commented. It was Macie’s dad. I let it go to voicemail and commented. “And you asked me earlier if we found anything peculiar here. You had to have meant the doll right?” 

“Look, Trish. I didn’t realize this was twenty questions and I would be grilled,” Sarah said nervously. 

The phone buzzed again. 

“If there’s something you aren’t telling me, I swear to god!” I said as I glanced at the caller id. It was her dad again. 

This time I picked it up. 

“Hey Chuck,” I said as I turned away from Sarah for a second. 

“Trish, I’m sorry to bother you but have you heard from Macie?” he asked. 

“Not since this morning. Why?” 

“Well I got a call from her job and they said she never showed up for work today.” 

That dread was sweeping over my body again. 

“What? But you dropped her off right?” I asked. 

I turned back to confront Sarah. 

But she was nowhere in sight. 

“I thought you dropped her off,” Chuck responded. 

Then I noticed something at the top of the mail. 

My mouth was dry. My palms, shaky. 

“Chuck, I’ll call you back okay?” I said as I reached for what I had seen. 

It was a missing persons poster. Someone had stuffed it into the mail box and it was crumpled up. 

It was a poster for Sarah.

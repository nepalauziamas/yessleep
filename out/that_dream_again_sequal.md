well, if you read my last post, then you would know what happened to me in that "dream". i use the word dream loosely because its more of a nightmare.   
 well i regret to inform you that said dream happened again, though like 10000X worse cause not only did it affect me, but it affected everyone i knew as well.   


ok so ill tell you the dream now:  
i woke up in a weird hallway again, like usual with these dreams. literally the exact same fucking spider thing was there too, but it was dead, i know i hurt it last time with a slash from my hand (it still hurts btw), but it was more injured. it looked like it killed itself by cannibalizing itself. so basically, IT FUCKING ATE ITSELF! (mind my language, I'm a bit angry after what happened in this dream)  
 this was extremely confusing, had it did this out of anger or fear? either way i wasn't going to fucking find out, cause all i did was cut off its leg with my hand and took it (the decay of it made it more fragile than it already was, it was like paper) then ran off, like usual in these dreams.   


after about 7 days of running (irl time, in the dream it was about 7 minutes) i fell through the floor, again, its the same old bullshit as last time, up until now. instead of waking up like usual, i woke up in a big fucking room, walls, ceiling and floor was made entirely out of old rusted pipes. (seriously what is it with the pipes?) with the thigs leg still in my hand, i walked to the centre of the room so i could get a sense of how big the room was, then i fell through the floor AGAIN, like seriously i swear im no clipping through the fucking floors like its a videogame, it was like cyberpunk 2077 type shit, with this glitching through the floor.   
 anyway i got off track lol  
 

this time i did wake up from the dream, and guess what. I FUCKING HAD THE THINGS LEG IRL. i could now go to the police WITH PROOF to tell them what happened.

so i did, and they didnt believe me, even though i was literally holding the fucking leg of that thing.   
they did take the leg though for "evidence". i swear they are in on this.   
ever since that last post, 3 dreams have happened, this was the first one. when i got home after, i tried my hardest to stay awake so i can thigure out what was going on without risking my life. im then came to the conclusion of that either the government or some secret organisation above the government that was using me as a test subject for their weird experiments (dont question it, i was tired af).   
 so then when i finally decided to go to sleep, i went prepared, again. this time with my decorative sword (i got it for decoration a few years before all of this dream bs, it was also very sharp so it could be used as an actual sword, it was an wakizashi).  
 when i fell asleep, i was in the large room again, but something was different, the pipes where now brand new brass pipes, no rust at all, and the room was bigger. so again, with sword i hand. i walked to the centre of the room and fell through the floor, when i woke up, i was in what seemed the hallway from the beginning. but instead of it being just one straight line, it had sections splitting off, like a maze of sorts. i then realized, i was in a sort of game, the hallways are the levels and the large rooms are the point between the levels or the loading area. (yet again, dont question it. i was stupid cause //spoiler alert// it wasnt a game)  
 and since i was in what i thought was a new level, there would be a new enemy to overcome (this is the only thing i got correct, is that there was a new thing in that maze with me)  
 so i set off to find it, confidant i would be able to defeat it. boy was i wrong.  


when i finally found the thing, it was nothing like the one before it, it was quite small, about the suze of a bath tub (lol i know i said " quite small " when its the size of a bath tub, but when you see what i face in the final dream before writing this, it would be quite small in comparison. and it was very small compared to the last one)  
 while small, it made up for it with its speed, when i first saw it, it was running around a section of hallway that was looping at extreme speeds.  
 so when it noticed me, it didnt do much at first. it just stopped running and glared at me, then more appeared, about 4 more. now there was 5 of them, staring right at me. i was cornered by them, as they slowly approached me, i swung my sword at the closest one, it let out a distorted human-like scream that sent shivers down my spine, and the other things there too, so i used that as my chance to escape. my sword got covered in its blood, which ment +extra poison damage (at this point i still though it was a game lol). so i ran back to the 4 remaining creatures and stabbed each one of them, killing all of them instantly. their screams sounded so human. they even sounded familiar. (at the time i didnt know it but i just killed the 5 people that got caught during the first dream, Y'know, the one at the campsite with all my friends n shit.)   
 thinking i completed this level (still though it was a game lol), i started to look for the next large room. (there was none).  
while looking i fell though the floor again and woke up, covered in green blood, like a bugs blood. my sword was very clean though, not even a smudge on it.

so i did the sane thing and cleaned myself up, but then i got a phone call from the hospital. all my friends that where "killed" in the first dram had died during the night. and that's when it hit me. what was the things that i killed where the trapped consciousness of the 5 people that where taken during the first dream. so i called up the other survivors of what happened that night. only one picked up. it was dave. he said that the other 2 survivors killed themselves and he tried to as well, but failed. kyle however just sat on the couch eating potato chips and watching rom cons, only falling asleep every few nights so he didnt have to go through the dreams as much.   
 since it was only dave, me and kyle, we decided to meet up at a bar one night to discuss what we should do. 

 when we arrived at the bar, Kyle immediately ordered a large shot of vodka, he only came for the drinks. me and dave didnt order anything. (im not going to bore ou with the dialog so imma just say what we came up with and what we should do)  
after discussing what we should do, we came to the conclusion to each go to sleep that nigh so we can complete this nightmare fully. (little did we know that in reality, we did nothing)

 when we entered the dream, all of us where in the large room again, and same as before, the pipes changed. this time they where shiny steel pipes.   
 we all brought our weapons with us, kyle had a fucking pistol, dave had some knuckledusters and i had my wakizashi. we all walked to the centre of the room but, this time we didnt fall through the floor, instead the floor of steel pipes, became a slab of concrete. this is what we thought was the final boss room(we still thought it was a game lol, we figured out that it wasn't after) .

right as we where investigating the new concrete floor a massive humanoid creature crawls out from the ceiling, spotting us immediately, it fell down to the floor and stared at us. it was about 60 meters tall and about 25 meters wide with a wingspan of 55 meters, dragging along the floor behind him (by wing span i mean arm length). to say that we shat ourselves at the sight of it, was an understatement. right when it took one stem towards us, dave took kyles gun and just shot himself to death. and it was about the 3rd shot to his head that killed him.   
  when his body fell to the floor, ne of those small creatures crawled out of his mouth and ran away into the wall off pipes.   
 the massive human looking thing was very slow, like 1 step every 5 seconds (well its size wold make that travel very far but easy to run away from)   
   
kyle, being the idiot he is, said a stupid joke "well the bigger you are, the harder you fall. well prepare for a earthquake then haha"  


well he was correct, its skin, like the first monster thingy, was like paper and was cut very easily, and since i had a sword, it only took about a minute to cut off its entire leg, and dice up the other one. basically immobilising it.  
 kyle, still being stupid, decided to climb up on its back and shoot its head at point blank range.   
and he actually succeeded. talk about florida man energy.   
 and when it fell to the floor, it crushed the now decayed body of dave, making recovery impossible. (not like it was possible in the first place but eh, it might have worked).  


me being the badass im definitely not, i cut of the things head (that was the size of a small car basically).   


and then i tried to wake up, but i couldnt. kyle did, i seen him freeze then just disappear. so then i realized that i was stuck. by myself next to a 60 meter tall corpse. just my luck. 

then the corpse started to heal. i then realized that you had to be the one to kill it to wake up.   
but this time, my sword was almost broken, i have no idea how but it just was. so i did the same thing i did last time and cut up its legs. i then climbed up onto its chest and plunged my sword right into the centre, killing it instantly, i then fell through the floor and woke up.  


i then rethanked everything that happened and went back to the original theory of it being some government test or smth.   


and that brings me to now, writing this for all of reddit to laugh at me and my friends stupidity.  


p.s. the bad spelling is because my hand still hurts and i cant be bothered to fix anything

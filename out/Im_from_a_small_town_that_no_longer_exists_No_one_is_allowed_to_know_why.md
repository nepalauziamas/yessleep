  

I’m from a small midwestern town I’m sure you’ve never heard of. And you never will. It wasn’t even a dot on the map, just seven hundred and sixty-one people on their own in the middle of nowhere. That’s why I’m telling this story. So that someone knows what happened there.

I remember as a kid we used to play in the corn field all the time. We lived on a farm just outside of town. The sidewalk literally began one block away from our house. It wasn’t much. A single main street with a general store, drug store, and hardware store. The grocery store and diner were around the corner just off the main street. The only reason we had a post office is because the nearest town was twenty miles away. It was the kind of place even Norman Rockwell would miss if he drove through. 

My brother, sister and I didn’t have a lot of toys or games, so we played hide and seek almost nonstop with a few of the other neighborhood kids. We tried playing around the house but with there usually being six or seven of us it was just too easy. 

The best time was during the summer after the corn got above our heads. Nobody wanted to be the seeker then because it was literally impossible to find anyone. 

Games would go on for hours with no one found. Our mom would have to come out and yell for us to come in for meals. 

The best part of hiding was when the seeker walked right past you. The excitement and sheer terror as you held your breath and tried to stay as still as possible was incomparable. I’d nearly pee my pants if the seeker stopped right beside me. There was that moment when you didn’t know if they had no clue where you were or if they knew and they were just toying with you. 

There were a couple of times when the seeker was toying with me, and they would stop right beside where I was hiding then take a step or two and lunge back and grab me. I screamed both times. Not the ‘Oh you got me’ squeal that kids do, I mean serious, bloodcurdling, ‘someone is trying to murder me’ scream. 

My mother came running to make sure I was ok and I got in trouble for scaring her so bad. I usually had to sit out the next turn as punishment watching the cornstalks sway and bend as the pursuers hunted down their prey.

The fun suddenly changed when the strangers came to town.  

I remember there were a lot of strangers around during that time in my life. By strangers I don’t mean people who act odd, they acted much more than odd. 

Remember when you were a kid and you dressed up as a superhero? You acted like the superhero you were dressed like. You would talk like him, walk like him, pretend you had the powers he had. You just did everything you could to fool anyone into thinking you were that superhero. This was the same only these people seemed to be dressed up pretending to be people.

It was weird. We would go to town and some of them would be just standing around pretending to be nonchalant. They were staring at nothing. Not the thousand-mile stare some people have, but literally staring at the strangest things. An old man in a rocking chair in front of the general store would sit staring at an unlit streetlight in the middle of the day. A man leaning against a door frame was staring at his hand as though he had never seen it before.

Odd things like that became more commonplace. And the people who lived in the town their entire lives noticed as well. The strangers were approached and asked who they were and where they were from. They would answer without taking their eyes off the object they were focused on. They said they were from a ways off and were traveling to their homeland. That seemed to appease people, for a while. Weeks later when they were still hanging around, people started to get anxious. 

My parents told us, kids, that the strangers were down on their luck and hadn’t done anything wrong. That’s what they said to our faces, but behind closed doors, I got the feeling they weren’t so optimistic. I went to the bathroom one night and had to pass by my parents’ bedroom to get there. I overheard them talking about the strangers and dad saying he would keep the gun loaded in case they ever came around.

It seemed odd that these strangers had never done anything wrong and yet were the subject of such hushed tones conversations spoken in fear. 

I remember when our neighbor, Mr. Hutchins went missing. He was a nice older man in his sixties or seventies, I think. He always gave out full-sized candy bars on Halloween. 

He used to be out early every morning tending his animals. We’d see him when we were on our way to school, and he’d always wave to us. 

One morning he just wasn’t there. We didn’t think much of it at the time. We thought maybe he was sick or something. In the evening he wasn’t there either. 

We told mom about it but she just said he was probably in town getting groceries or farm supplies. 

The next morning when we went to school there was still no Mr. Hutchins. When we told mom after school, she decided to go visit to see if he had fallen. When there was no answer at the door and the animals were out roaming, mom decided to call the Sherriff.  

Mom tried to shoo us inside when the Sherriff’s car showed up, but we just went upstairs to Bobby’s room and watched out the window. 

The Sherriff knocked and called for Mr. Hutchins, then went inside. He was in there for a long time. We started thinking one of Mr. Hutchins’ dogs had chewed him up or something when the Sherriff finally came back out. He got into his car and used the radio. Next thing we know three more Sherriff’s cars show up and they start going in and out of the house and barn like a swarm of angry bees. 

We asked mom about it at supper and she wasn’t too pleased that we had been snooping. 

Dad was out of town doing his deliveries, but he would’ve told us to mind our own business and stay out of others’ affairs. 

Mom told us the Sherriff didn’t know where Mr. Hutchins had gone to, but his truck was still there so he couldn’t have gotten far. They said he might’ve had a spell and wandered off.

They looked for him for two days, then suddenly he showed up at his house as if nothing had happened. 

We were happy he was back, but curious where he’d been. 

After he came home, he just sat on his porch and stared at the tree in his front yard. We went over to visit him and asked him where he had been.

He kept staring at the tree like we weren’t there. 

“Mr. Hutchins?” I said.

“Yes?” he said staring at the tree.

“How are you, sir?” I said.

He didn’t answer right away. His stare never wavered. Finally, he said, “Good.”

“We were wondering where you had gone, sir,” Bobby said.

“I was… “ he seemed to struggle with the right word. “Away.”

“Well, we’re glad your back, sir,” Candace said. “Do you need any help with your animals?”

“Animals?” he said as if the word was unfamiliar to him.

“Yes, sir, taking care of your animals like we’ve done before,” she said.

He didn’t reply, just stared at the tree.

I looked at Bobby and Catherine. They both seemed as shocked as I was that he was ignoring us. We’d always been on good terms with Mr. Hutchins. There were times we would help out around his farm and with his animals. He would reward us with some money or some treats, but always he was grateful for the help. 

I waved my hand in front of his eyes and he didn’t blink.

We shook our heads and walked away. When we got home we told mom how he was acting. We told her we thought something was wrong with him like he was sick. Mom told us to leave him alone that he’d had a hard time and we shouldn’t be pestering him.

But we soon had more to worry about. We played hide and seek all weekend when we weren’t doing our chores. It was the last fun weekend of my childhood. 

We went to school on Monday and got a nasty shock. One of my classmates and buddies that I hung out with was Mike. When I got to class, Mike was already in his seat staring at the blackboard. 

“Morning, Mike,” I said.

He didn’t move or speak.

“What’s up with you?” I said. “You stay up too late last night?”

“No,” he said still staring.

“So what’s with the zombie routine?” I said. “You practicing for Halloween?”

“No,” he said, not blinking.

“Ok, so you’re playing a joke on me. Ha ha very funny,” I said. “You can return to earth now, zombie Mike.”

He didn’t move and stopped talking.

“Whatever, man,” I said and let him play his game. 

All through class, he didn’t say a word, even when the teacher called on him. He just sat there and stared at the board.  She chided him for ignoring her, but then when she came over to his desk and waved her hand in front of his eyes he didn’t blink.

“Mike?” she said.

He didn’t answer. 

“I haven’t seen him move in over an hour,” I said.

She took him to the nurse mumbling that maybe he’d had a stroke. When the teacher returned she was alone and very rattled. She made us read for the rest of the period while we heard her out in the hallway discussing Mike’s odd behavior with another teacher.

Mike never came back to class that day. When class ended I approached her.

“How’s Mike?” I said.

She seemed nervous.

“I… I’m not sure,” she said.

“Is he ok?”

“I don’t know,” she said getting up and walking to the door. “If you want to know any more about him you’ll have to ask his parents.”

She held the door open as I walked through it, then shut it and went back to her desk. I saw her pick up her phone. She didn’t look very happy as she talked.

I went home confused and concerned for my friend. I asked mom if I could go over to Mike’s house to check on him. She told me to go over and come back in an hour for supper. 

As I walked down the street towards Mike’s I saw more people standing around staring at nothing. It was like they just paused in the middle of whatever they were doing and found something extremely interesting. It was creepy. 

When I knocked on Mike’s door, his mom answered.

“Oh, hey, Billy,” she said. “Mike isn’t feeling well right now.”

“I know,” I said. “I saw him at school today and he was acting weird. I just wanted to check and see if he was ok.”

She glanced inside the house.

“Umm… I don’t know if you would call it ok or not.”

“Is he still acting like a zombie?” I said expecting her to laugh.

She shot me a horrified look.

“Maybe you should come in and see for yourself.”

I stepped inside and she led me back to his room. He was standing there in the middle of the floor looking up at the light fixture. It wasn’t even turned on.

“Hey, buddy,” I said. “Just came by to see how you’re doing.”

“Good,” he said still staring.

“I was a little worried about you the way you were acting at school today.”

He stood silent.

“Ok, Mike, whatever game you’re playing you win,” I said. “Now it’s time to snap out of it and be normal again.”

His gaze slowly slid down from the light and landed on me. 

“Normal?” he said slowly.

“Yeah, normal,” I said. “You know, like everyone else?”

He didn’t answer but his stare freaked me out. It was like he was looking at me but not looking at me at the same time.

“You know what, Mike, I’ve had it with this stupid game,” I said. “If you don’t quit it, we’re not friends anymore.”

“Friends?” he said staring through me.

“Yes, friends,” I said. “You and I have been friends for years and you know that.”

He stood silent and unmoving.

“Ok, I’m done,” I said walking out of the room.

His mom followed me out.

“Are you really not going to be friends with him anymore?” she said.

“I was just trying to get him to quit playing,” I said peeking around the corner to see Mike staring at the spot where I had been standing.

“Did the nurse say anything about what could’ve happened?” I said.

“She said it might have been a stroke but his vital signs say everything’s fine.”

“This is too weird,” I said. “He’s acting just like… “

“Like who?” she said as I rushed out the door.

“Like who?” she called after me.

I ran to Mr. Hutchins' house and found him sitting on the front porch. He was staring at the tree like the day we came to talk to him.

“Mr. Hutchins,” I said. “What happened when you disappeared?”

He didn’t respond.

“Mr. Hutchins,” I said grabbing him and giving him a little shake. “I need to know.”

His head slumped forward. I jumped back.

“Mr. Hutchins?” I said slowly approaching him again.

I reached for his neck to feel for a pulse. I waited a long time before realizing there was none. 

As I pulled my hand away, he grabbed it. I jumped trying to get away but his grip was too strong.

He stared into my eyes.

“Normal… “ he said in a raspy voice that I didn’t recognize. 

Then he slumped over again.

When he released me I ran home.

“Mom, mom!” I said as I burst in the door. 

“Billy, what is it?” she said.

“It’s Mr. Hutchins.”

“Has he gone missing again?” she said.

“No, I think he’s dead.”

She stopped making supper and turned slowly toward me.

“Dead?”

“Yes.”

“How do you know?” she said.

I explained what happened with Mike and how I went to Mr. Hutchins' house after. I told her what happened there and she got this far-off look.

“Stay here,” she said walking out of the door.

I watched her walk over to Mr. Hutchins' house. I saw her look at the body, then I saw her cover her mouth and run home. When she burst in the door she went straight for the phone and called 911.

Within fifteen minutes there were just as many flashing lights at his house as the day he went missing.

The Sherriff asked me some questions about it. I don’t think he believed me about the grabbing and talking part. He said Mr. Hutchins had been dead for hours.

When he was done we finally had supper. None of us talked much except for asking to pass the food. After supper, I went to my room and lay on my bed staring at the ceiling and wondering what was going on.

Before I knew it I had fallen asleep.

When I woke I was surprised that I was still in my clothes from the day before and had slept on top of my blanket. Usually, if I fall asleep like this, mom comes in and covers me up. 

She must’ve been tired last night from all the excitement. 

I got up and went out to the kitchen. There was no one there and nothing cooking. That in itself was odd. Mom was always the first one up in the morning, cooking breakfast. Even if we just had cereal she was up making coffee for her and dad.

It was eerie walking into a dark kitchen and getting my own cereal. I expected her to show up at any moment but she never did. Bobby and Catherine stumbled into the room and got their breakfast too.

“Is mom sick or something?” Catherine said.

“I don’t know, maybe she’s just upset from the whole Mr. Hutchins thing,” I said.

Bobby just sat and munched on his cereal half awake. 

We finished breakfast and got ready for school. Still no mom. I went to their bedroom and peeked inside. Dad and mom were both laying in bed so I left them sleep.

That school day was completely surreal. Half the kids were out sick. I’d never seen anything like it except on the first day of deer season. Even a couple of the teachers just sat there staring like Mike had. They didn’t talk to us all day. We just sat there, reading or talking quietly to each other hoping that no one would be loud enough to break the teacher out of her stupor.

I knew something was wrong. The strangers had done something to make these people into these weird zombies. I wish I had another word for it because I hadn’t seen anyone trying to attack or bite anyone else… yet. They just hang around like zombies would before they attack. I just hoped the attack would never come.

When we got home from school that day mom and dad were still in bed. I went into their room and stood beside the bed. Mom’s eyes were open, staring at the wall.

“Mom,” I said. “Are you ok?”

“Yes,” she said without blinking.

“Is dad ok?”

“Yes.”

“Have you been in bed all day?”

She didn’t answer.

“Are you gonna cook supper?”

She didn’t answer.

I waved my hand in front of her face and she didn’t blink. 

“Please, mom,” I said. “Please snap out of it. We need you.”

For the slightest moment, her eyes met mine and a single teardrop fell from her eye. Then she went back to staring at the wall.

I went out and told Bobby and Catherine that they were still in bed and I didn’t think they’d be coming out anytime soon.

“Should we call someone?” Catherine said.

“Like who?” Bobby said.

“I don’t know, the doctor maybe?” she said.

“Ok,” I said pulling out the phone book and looking up the number for the doctor. 

I dialed and waited as it rang and rang. 

“No one’s answering,” I said. 

“Who else can we call?” she said.

“We used to ask Mr. Hutchins for help when we needed,” Bobby said. 

I horrible thought suddenly struck me.

“You don’t think mom and dad will end up… “ I said unable to finish the sentence.

“Like Mr. Hutchins?” Catherine said.

I nodded. Bobby started to cry.

“We don’t know that’ll happen,” Catherine said. “Mr. Hutchins was old. Much older than mom and dad.”

Bobby sniffled a few times and stopped crying.

“So what do we do now?” he said.

“Let’s make some sandwiches for us and for mom and dad,” I said. “We can take them in and see if they’re hungry.”

We did exactly that. But neither of them responded. They just laid in bed staring at the walls.

The three of us ate our sandwiches and put ourselves to bed. We agreed to call the doctor again in the morning and if he didn’t answer we’d call the Sherriff.

None of us went straight to sleep that night. We were too worried about mom and dad. I was also worried about Mike. This whole thing seemed like it was something out of a late-night movie. I couldn’t imagine it being real. I kept trying to pinch myself to wake up from this bad dream.

Before I knew it, I could hear my brother and sister’s breathing settle into the rhythm of sleep. I smiled for the first time in a while listing to them in peaceful slumber. 

As I listened, I heard another sound. Floorboards creaking. I froze at the thought of a burglar breaking in and dad not being able to do anything about it. 

The steps came closer. I huddled under my blanket for protection. The door creaked open. I snuck a glance and felt immediate relief. It was mom. She was still dressed in her nightgown. She moved slowly to Catherine’s bed and lifted her up. She turned and carried her out of the room. Then dad came in and carried out Bobby.

I got up and followed.

“Mom, dad,” I said. “Where are you taking them?”

Mom already had the door open and was walking outside.

Dad stopped and looked at me.

“Don’t worry,” he said. “We’ll come back for you.”

Then they walked out into the cool night.

My blood froze. I didn’t know where they were going but I knew I didn’t want to go there. I threw my shoes on and stepped outside. 

As I flew down the stairs I saw a strange light at the end of our driveway. There were two silhouettes in it and they were heading back toward the house. I squinted against the light, trying to see if it was my parents, or whatever those things were that looked like my parents. As the figures grew closer, I could see they were empty-handed. 

I stood in the middle of our yard, frozen with fear. I didn’t know what to do. If I went back inside, they would find me and take me to be turned into a zombie too. I couldn’t run to Mr. Hutchins’ house. Running to town would leave me wide open to be chased down. 

I turned round and round in a panic looking for options. The barn was an option, but not a good one. There weren’t many hiding places there.

Then it hit me.

Hiding places.

Where was my best hiding place?

I ran into the cornfield. 

It was nearly harvest time and the corn was as tall as it was going to get. It was dark and would be even darker in the rows of corn. The only light came from the house and whatever was at the end of our driveway. I threw myself into the forest of green stalks and ran. Partway in I stopped and realized what I’d done. I had run in a straight line making myself an easy target. I refocused on my usual hide-and-seek strategy. I started from where I was, counted a certain number of rows up and a certain number over. I was careful to move slowly and disturb the corn stalks as little as possible.  

I duck walked staying as low to the ground as possible and moving as quietly as I could. I was near where I wanted to hide when something in my head told me to stop where I was. It was almost totally dark. The lights from the house and that thing cast strange shadows at the base of the corn. I could barely see a few feet in front of me.

I resisted the urge to sit down and instead stayed in my crouched position on my toes so I could be ready to bolt at a moment's notice. 

I settled into my spot and focused on slowing my breathing. My adrenaline fought against me, telling me to run and never stop running. I pushed those thoughts aside and tried to be as silent as possible. 

The air was still. There was no wind and nothing moved. I became hypersensitive to the sounds I was making. Each time I inhaled and exhaled it sounded like a steam engine chugging to get up a hill. Any movement I made I heard the creak of the sole of my sneakers. I could even hear my neck muscles as I turned slowly searching for any pursuers. It was like my body was conspiring against me, bound and determined to get caught.

Somehow, over all the racket I was making, I heard a sound. I closed my eyes and focused on listening. For a long moment, there was nothing. I mean nothing. Not even the nightly crickets were singing. And then I heard it again. 

Someone was in the cornfield. 

They were moving slowly. I tried to tell if it was one or many. At first, I couldn’t, but then I heard another sound coming from behind me. They were still a little ways off. I thought they had just entered the cornfield. 

I painted a mental picture of how close they were. My mental map showed me one coming from the direction of the house and one from the driveway.  As I heard them getting closer I had to fight to stay still. My mind was screaming at me to run. I knew from so many hide-and-seek sessions that was the worst thing to do. 

I kept my eyes closed and waited for them to pass me by. Then I would sneak out in the other direction. That plan seemed to appease my nerves enough to stop yelling. 

I heard one of them approaching. They were coming right at me. I could see the stalks beside me moving. But I stayed still. Two rows before one of my pursuers would’ve literally run me over, they stopped. It seemed like there was a moment of indecision, and then they started off again in a different direction.

I wanted to breathe a sigh of relief but the other one was still approaching. They were walking slowly up the row beside the one I was in. They walked right beside me and stopped. I recognized my dad’s boots, I just didn’t know what was wearing them now. 

He turned towards me. 

I knew I was done. There was nowhere I could run that he wouldn’t catch me. I kept my eyes closed, refusing to move, even to look up at the man I called father or what he had become. 

He stood there unmoving for what seemed like an eternity. Self-preservation was all that kept me from surrendering. I had seen these empty shells of people I used to love, and I wanted to survive to pass on the memories of who they were, before…

He turned and took a step away from me, then another. 

I wanted to jump for joy, I wanted to run as I’d never run before. But mostly I wanted to be careful. I remembered the times playing hide and seek when the seeker pretended to walk away only to turn around and lunge at me.

I held my breath as his footsteps continued away from me.

I counted to one hundred before I would allow myself to move. 

As I started to sneak away I saw an ear of corn lying on the ground. I picked it up and threw it as hard as I could in the opposite direction of my escape route. When it landed I heard both of my pursuers converge on it. 

I ran quickly and quietly away from them. Before I knew it, I was at the edge of the cornfield near the road. I peeked out and saw the light at the end of my driveway. It didn’t look like headlights from a vehicle, it was just a bright light hovering a few feet off the ground. It was so bright I couldn’t tell what it was attached to or if it was attached to anything. At this point, I didn’t know what I believed anymore. I just knew someone or something had taken the people I love and turned them into zombies.

No, zombies wasn't right, it was more like robots. They would just stare at whatever until needed, then they would be called to action, like mom and dad.

I turned away from the light and ran. 

It wasn’t long until I heard a strange sound. It was like a mechanical scream. It chilled my bones to hear it. It seemed to be coming from behind me. The light was getting brighter too. I knew it was following me. 

Dad dashed out of the cornfield and tried to grab me, but I was already out of his reach. I could hear him running behind me when mom came around the corner and I nearly ran into her. 

I have no idea how I avoided her open arms. Maybe somewhere along the line, there was some football player genes in me, but I did a stiff-arm spin move that would make any running back proud. 

I ran like my life depended on it, which it did. My legs were burning, my lungs were on fire, I had a stitch in my side, and yet I kept running. My parents and the light chasing right behind me just waiting for me to trip or make some mistake.

I was almost in town when a light shone in front of me. It also hovered just off the ground. I was trapped. With nowhere left to go, I stopped. It wasn’t more than a heartbeat until dad had a hold of me. 

Mom was right behind him. They each grabbed an arm and turned me around to head back towards the driveway light. At least they were walking and I could take a breather before being turned into a zombie robot.

The light behind us got brighter and I heard a strange sound from that direction. They sounded somewhat familiar though. As the light got closer suddenly my dad started convulsing. He fell to the ground followed shortly by my mom. 

Someone ran up and grabbed me.

“Come on, kid,” a large man said. “Let’s get you outta here.”

I turned from my now unconscious parents to the man. He was in a soldier’s uniform and holding a taser. He dropped it and ran with me halfway over his shoulder toward the other light. 

The closer we got I turned to see it was a helicopter. It touched down just long enough for us to get on then take off again. 

I watched as we flew over my parents laying there, looking very dead.

“Could the shock bring them out of it?” I said hopefully.

“Sorry, kid, it doesn’t work that way,” he said. “Once they’ve been turned there’s no going back.”

A tear slid down my cheek as I watched my parents disappear into the distance. I looked back at the house I had lived in my entire life and hopelessness overwhelmed me. For a fleeting moment, I felt like I would’ve been better off with them. At least we would all be together as a family.

My eyes caught a long line of lights driving into town. 

“What’s that?” I said pointing at the lights.

“Containment,” he said.

“What does that mean?”

“It means we can’t let anyone escape who’s been infected.”

“Infected?”

He shrugged. “I don’t have a better word for it.”

I thought for a moment.

“Am I infected?” I said.

He looked at me.

“Are you talking?”

“Yes.”

“Are you staring mindlessly at inanimate objects?”

“No.”

“You’re not infected.”

I slumped back in the seat and closed my eyes, happy to be alive, but incredibly sad for those I’d lost. I don’t remember falling asleep, but when I woke we were on a military base. Soldiers were hustling around like ants on an anthill. 

A man in a suit came over to the helicopter and took me inside. 

What happened next is a long story that I might tell someday. 

Suffice it to say for now that after a long time, I was taken to a foster family who raised me as their own. 

The town I used to live in ceased to exist. I never saw I single soul from there ever again. I was told I was the only one that was rescued that night before…

I don’t want to get into that right now. 

I’ve tried going back but it’s surrounded by a fence with ‘No trespassing, government property’ signs posted every twenty feet. It surrounds the entire town. I can see my old house from the fence, but no matter what I do they won’t let me back in. I have to wonder if they don’t have the people in there standing around, staring at nothing, waiting to die.

I’ve searched the internet for any traces of the town. There aren’t any. It’s like every piece of history, every shred of proof that the town ever existed has been erased. 

I’ve talked to others who’ve heard of similar experiences. The words ‘paranormal’, ‘possession’, and ‘alien’ come up the most for possible explanations. But I wonder if it isn’t something deeper than that. If it isn’t something so sinister that explanations could be dangerous.

Maybe it’s for the best. Maybe I should just drop the whole thing and move on with my life. I just can’t help but wonder what really went on. It’s a mystery I need to unravel for Mom, Dad, Bobby, Catherine, Mike, Mr. Hutchins, and everyone else whose life was erased, first by whoever or whatever did this to them, and then by those who want to cover it up.

I posted this to let everyone know about the people who used to be my friends, family, and neighbors. I don’t want their memories to be in vain. 

But mostly I don’t want to allow others to fall into the same trap. If you see someone staring at nothing in particular and they refuse to speak, get away from them as soon as you can, they aren’t as lost and helpless as you think.

How many other tiny towns in the middle of nowhere have suffered the same fate?

I wonder…

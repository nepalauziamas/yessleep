This story takes place one night a couple years ago when on a bike ride with a couple of friends. It was cold and dark, the only illumination being the street lights. Me and my friends decided that we would call it a night and go back home since out parents wanted us back home. We started making our way back when I spotted a red car some kind of Hatchback Toyota which at first I had thought nothing of as it was just a car passing. I start making my way up a bit of a slope, because i specifically remember spotting it when I was making my way up the hill that leads to my street when I spotted the car again go past us slowly. I looked back to my friends and asked if they remember that car going past us before, which they agreed too. My friends started worrying, although I stayed calm to assess the situation at hand.

At this point we continued riding onwards. the plan was that I, with my friend take one of my friends home, then go with the final friend to take him home, then I alone would go home by myself as I was the least scared at the time. Firstly we took my friend home when a black car this time went past us. We didn't think anything of it when it turned around and parked at a house directly next to us, we continued riding, picking up a bit of speed this time. We go onwards and turn right into my friends street, we get to his house, he says his goodbyes and tells us to be careful. We say the same to him and roll back down the way we came. I glanced to my left to see the red car, lurking within the shadows. Fear overwhelmed me so I continued moving faster with my friend tailing behind me.

We were on our way to my other friends house to take him home when I saw the black car, still there, waiting. We moved forward taking a longer route in an attempt to avoid the car. We rode a couple minutes to his house and he said his goodbyes. He rushed inside as he was the most skeptical. I was alone now, I went down his street and saw the lights of a car approaching, the lights faded away and the car had dissapeared out of thin air. I was left confused but I tried to stay as calm as possible. Instead of taking the detour as I did before, I took a shortcut, through a dark, quiet alleyway. As I rode to the end of the alleyway, the black car I had seen eaerlier was still there, waiting. I turned right and my house way in sight. I didn't want the people knowing where I lived so I rode past my house and went behind a large thick tree. As I stood there my heart sunk when I saw the same red car from before, although it didn't see me, I started to panic so I called my friend who said I should wait a bit until I moved again.

I waited there for about ten more minutes until I had the courage to go back home. I rode up to my house and went up my driveway as fast as I could. I made my way as fast I could behind my hedges to look out and that's when I saw the black car reverse out and drive right past my house, my heart dropped when the thought came unto me that it might've seen me go up my driveway.

Now whenever I see a red car it reminds me of that night. I remember this night at times and wonder what intention those two cars had with us on that night, with three teens riding their bikes. I suppose we will never know.

edit; i fucked the title and forgot to add "By Multiple Cars" and instead it says "Multiple Cars" and I can't change it

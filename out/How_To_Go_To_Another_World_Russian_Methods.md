Hello everyone! As you may remember me, I am the Japanese OtherWorld Method uploader. My account was deleted so I couldn’t post any methods but here I am back here again but anyways here are 5 OtherWorld Methods. I know that most of them are mostly anime methods but it’s just people who love anime and I got these from an anime VK page and one otherworld method page. The methods may or may not be bullshit so let’s get to it :

Method 1 :

Requirements :

1. Strong self-confidence.

2. White chalk or coal.

3. Candle, preferably church

4. Matches or lighter

5. Needle, knife or razor

Steps :

1. Draw a circle 2 meters wide with the chalk you grabbed, you can draw a circle one and a half.

2. Draw straight small vertical sticks, twelve pieces around it and then draw a pentagram star in the circle.

3. Light a candle and put it in the middle of the star, puncture your finger on your left hand and drop a drop of blood on the light and then whisper:Take away the fire, bring the fire. You take me away, please take me away!!!

NOTES :

1. The ritual should take place on the full moon, at midnight with the windows open! And also, if everything is right, you will lose consciousness and wake up in their world! By the way, you can perform exactly the same ritual, only without a star in a circle.

Method 2 :

Requirements :
1. Mirror

2. Belief

Steps :

1. You have to stand in front of the mirror (the bigger the mirror, the better!) and put your hands on it, (it all happens with your eyes closed.) Next say "come pick me up." He has to take your hand and tighten you in the mirror. You can only come back if you ask him to bring him back. But it's not that simple, in return he will set you such a condition, he will offer to fight him and if you win you will come back.

NOTES :

1. This method was (supposedly) guaranteed to work and it was written by a girl on her forum, she did it and along with other people and the other people said that the method worked but she began to get asked too many questions to the point where she deleted her whole forum.

Method 3 :

Requirements :

1. Apple

2. Paper with red marker or green (If you chose a green apple)

Steps :

1. At exactly 12AM on any night, go on top of the roof of your house (This may be impossible but atleast try) then after that look up at the sky and try to find the biggest star you can see, when you manage find the biggest star, bite on the apple.

2. Once you do that, grab the paper with the marker of the apple color and write the words “Come For Me”. Once you do that, you will hear a loud thunder in the sky.

3. Once you hear the thunder, get down from the rooftop and go inside your home. If you notice anything different, Congratulations! The ritual has succeeded.

NOTES :

1 . The color of the apple and marker have to be exactly the same, otherwise the method will not work.

Method 4 (Prayer To Anime Deity “Otaku”) :

Requirements :

1. Nothing

Steps :

1. It is said that if you can contact the Deity Of Anime Artists (“Otaku”) You can go to the anime world of your choice. First you must say the following prayer on any night you wish at exactly 3AM : 
“O great Otaku I offer you the gift of my leg, arm/hand, and iris/diaphragm and I ask you to take/deliver me to the world of the anime (Name of the anime you want to go too), Amen.

NOTES :

1. It is unknown whether this method works or not, I could not find any sources whatsoever so it could mean this is made up.

Final Method :

Requirements :

1. Dark place for the ritual (forest, shed, basement, attic).

2. A mirror, half the height of your body.

3. Scroll, paper.

4. Black marker.

5. Any sharp, cutting object, preferably a knife.

6. Lipstick, red.

7. Stones, any.

Steps :

1. Drag the mirror to the place of your choice, put it vertically and sit in front of it. Lifting your hand to the mirror, close your eyes and show exactly how you want to get into their world. Then, fix the scroll with stones so that it does not curl up, clearly print it.

2. After that, take a knife and pierce your finger and drip a drop of blood on the middle of the scroll. After that, we leave the scroll and knife on the ground and move two meters away.

3. Next, close your eyes and say: “My dream will come true. The dream is real, the thought is material! I believe so much that my dream will come true!!!” Next, open your eyes, take lipstick, go to the mirror and draw on it a circle five centimeters from the corners. We peer into the mirror for exactly ten minutes, turn on Sharingan and enter the circle!

NOTES :

1. This ritual is suitable for people (oddly enough) who have Sharingan.

And that is it guys. I will post more methods in the future, If you would like to try one of these, let me know your experience in the comment section and I will see y’all soon!

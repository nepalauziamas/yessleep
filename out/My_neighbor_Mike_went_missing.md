My next door neighbor Mike was a quiet but fun guy to be around, he'd come over for my barbecues on the weekends whenever he could, I would sometimes come to his place and we would hang out and watch his favorite soap opera on his TV.

He'd gotten a job at a robotics company down the street, he never talked much about, I was always working down town so I never got to see him at his work.

He'd only worked there for a week until he started acting strangely around everyone.

It started on the second week after he'd got the job, he'd started walking down the street everyday instead of using his car, I'd assumed it was becuase he wanted to get some exercise since he's usually go to the gym regularly.

I'd invited him over the next day for another barbecue and to hangout with his childhood friends, he did come over for it but the way he walked was crooked and almost stiff.

His eyes were a bit foggy and looked like a ruined painting, he was zoneing in and out and just looked into the sky at random.

The next day he smelled bad, but not terrible, he had bugs following him around and he hasn't reacted to them at all, he'd still walk down the street to work, I didn't know why.

One day he was just gone, I went to his house to see if he was alright, the door was unlocked and it smelled like a bloodbath in there, I went into his bathroom and saw writing on the walls in a strange substance, I was unsure if it was blood or something else entirely.

I called the police later that day after being unable to find him, the substance was his own blood as they found out but it was mixed with another liquid that they couldn't identity.

After a few years since he went missing, he was pronounced dead, nobody knew where he went, he never left a note or anything.

Later I was browsing through some forums and chatrooms and came across some legend called "The Amalgam", it was about a man who's body is completely deformed and rotten with what looked to be a bunch of Robotic parts inside them, It was on the news for a while.

I later got a note in the mail, the hand writing looked unnatural and child-like, but I was able to make out what it said...

"Dear Josh, I never intended for my life to end like this, I've alway felt like I'm the cuase of my family's deaths, now I've paid for the consequences as the very creations of a painful past have caught up to me, they talk to me, some wanted freedom, some wanted a second chance, some wanted chaos, I hope you are well."

There was no signature on the note, but I knew who it was from, I knew he was still out there...

Mike, if you're out there, if you're reading this somehow, please come back, I want to help you, I want to unserstand your pain, meet me at that old building next to your home...

When i was 21, i moved in a small house. The thing i liked the most about it was that it was a Victorian-style house. I really loved how the house looked, so i regreted when i had to move.


I bought it at a really low price. I'm talking about about less than an apartament. I thought it was pretty wierd because of the beauty of the house, but i still bought it. I wish i never did. 


First week after moving in, everything was normal. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary. But everything changed after about 2 weeks. 


I came home one night later than usual and i was thinking that i was gonna take a shower, eat something and then go to sleep. But right as i was walking towards the bathroom, i spoted something in the corner of my eye.

 As i turned around, i saw that on the top of the covers of the bed there was some green powder that i could not for the life of me make out what it was. I  was thinking that maybe it was some kind of polen or  dust from outside, because i usually leave my window vertically open. 


I went and cleaned it and then did what i wanted to. 
Almost half an year passes and i almost forgot about the incident and now it was autumn. 


But it happened again. 


Came home, went to take a shower, but on the way there i glanced again at the bed only to see it completely covered in that green dust. I cleaned it and thought that it was pretty wierd. 


There used to be a green ceiling in that bedroom, but i got it profesionally cleaned beforehand. I also considered the possibility that it might have been something left in the ceiling light, cause it had a bowl-like shape. Still, i went and did my normal routine and now i know how stupid it was to not investigate then and there. 


3 nights in a row this happened and only on the fourth day i decided to buy a motion-triggered camera to put up in my room to see what was going on. 

That night when i came home from work and sat down to review the footage. I found 12 recordings. 

Most of them were nothing interesting like passing cars or trees moving in the wind. 
Then i saw the last 3 recordings. In all of them there seemed to be a boy about 7 years old dressed in really old clothing and he glowed this neon green. For the first 2 recordings, he just sat on rocking chair i had in my room. 

But in the third one, from a jar, he seemed to be pouring that exact same green powder i had found on my bed. He did this for about 3 seconds before walking out of view. The camera stopped recording and i looked at the time it was filmed at . 7:07 pm . I looked at the clock above my door. 7:30 pm . I freezed. It was fresh, so that meant that i could probably see some find of trace as to where he went. And i did. 

Little green footsteps were on the wood floor. I followed them and when i reached a wall, i looked in front of me and saw that the footsteps were going up the wall and stopped on the trapdoor that leads to my attic. I took out a ladder and opened that attic, holding my phone's lantern in front of me. 

I shone with it through the attic. 

There was green wallpaper covering all of the walls and when i looked at the floor i saw there was that green powder covering the entirety of it. 

I then realized that i was standing in a room that looked to be a nursery with old toys in piles in every corner and a small bed. Right next to that bed, there was a toybox that was wide open and inside there was the skeleton of a really young human that had green bones. I screamed at the top of my lungs and got the hell out of there. 

I obviously freaked out like crazy. After i had calmed down a bit, i remembered something that i had forgotten until then: beacause this house was probably built in the victorian era, it also probably had green wallpaper. The worst thing is that they used to paint everything that was supposed to be green with arsenic. 
A lot of kids died young back then because they would inhale tha dust that was slowly falling from the walls. That must have been a kid that died like this and i think it was trying to make friends. 

Now i live in a small apartament in a small city. I didn't take anything from that house, as anything and everything could be contaminated. I visited the doctors and i did inhale the dust, but thankfully it wasn't that bad, so i stayed in the hospital for like 3 days before returning home. 

I didn't sell the house and i never bought something that looked too good to be true, because it probably was.

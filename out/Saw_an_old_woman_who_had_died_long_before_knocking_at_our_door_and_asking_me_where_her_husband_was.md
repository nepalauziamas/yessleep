So I and my younger brother were chilling at our new bought home. Please note our new house had its previous owners killed by some accident and had been closed since. Our parents had left and had head out to buy some groceries and some materials which was not told to us. As we are sports cricket fan, we started out with the television channel first and began enjoying ourselves.

In the middle of our entertainment, I hear a knock probably someone ringing the doorbell. I just head out to the door while my younger brother just lies there with his eyes on the television screen. As soon as I open the door, I see an old lady with white hair probably in her 70s and super wrinkled face and twitching hands.

In a nervous tone, I say *“Yes?”*. The old lady just does not answer me and after a few seconds just looks up and says *“Where is my husband, Charles?”*. I stand there look confused and answer *“Mam, I am afraid you may have the wrong address.”* She just stands there and repeats herself murmuring *“Where is my husband, Charles Will-?”* atleast twice

I stand there and reply *“We have just bought this house a month ago, I think you may be looking for the previous owners but this house has had been closed for nearly ten years before we shifted here.”*

She stands there empty and looks as if she is just confused with what was happening. She looks here and there as if she requires help. My younger brother shouts my name from the back and questions me *“Who is it? Whats the matter? What’s taking you so long?”*

I turn around so as to reply *“Oh it’s nothing. I think they might have mistaken our house for someone else’s”.* As soon as I turn around to reply to the old women, I notice there to be no one.

As scared and bewildering horror I had seen at that time, I just couldn’t control my heart beat and my heart started beating faster.  A few seconds later after closing the door and laying there on the couch, I calm myself and tell my younger brother the story of what happened and he says in a jokingly manner *“it might me the previous owner. I heard she was an old women. Why dint you say Hello to the old dead women. I am pretty sure she came from heaven just for you”* and starts laughing for the coward I am. I thought I could be hallucinating or maybe the old women was someone else who found out she was at the wrong door and probably left without an explaination.

My parents arrive maybe after an hour and my younger brother tells this whole story to my parents. My mothers tells me *“Well the previous owner was an old women whose name was Angellie Williams who had died after being stabbed by her husband who commited suicide”*. *“Don’t worry, that was all ten years ago and that is not the same old women who approached you”.* I calmed myself down and eventually forgot about it.

A week later, I suddenly remember about this incident and thought of searching it up on Google only to discover that **Ten Years ago, A madhusband Charles Williams had murdered his wife Angelie Williams just because of some heated argument fight**

 I have recently discovered something that has been hidden from the public for over half a decade. See, I am a software engineer, coming from Stanford, and have been in the field for 14 years. Today is the first time I have ever felt afraid for my life. To be fair, I haven’t explained this yet and you are all thinking I am crazy, but I *fear* Facebook. This company has been pulling the strings for far too long, and no one seems to understand the magnitude of the AI field. Maybe I will be arrested, interrogated, and even tortured for this, but if the world doesn’t know about this project, no competition can catch up. Not Elon Musk, not Google, not OpenAI, and not the CCP. I have no idea if even the US government knows of this project, but judging how little reprisal Facebook earns in court, I assume yes.

The story starts in early October, right before Facebook changes its name to “Meta.” I am in a Zoom meeting when I get an email from one of my colleagues to verify something important. I drag the notification aside and continue in my Zoom meeting when I get another notification with a less formal tone than the previous one. “I Need You On This, Jonathan.” It links to a

When I click on the email, it takes me to a document with several thousand lines of code. My colleague has highlighted a specific section and asks me to take a look. At first glance, it appears to be gibberish. But as I look closer, I start to see patterns emerge. This is code for an artificial intelligence program – a very sophisticated one.

I spend the next few hours going through the code, and what I find is truly astonishing. This AI program is designed to not just observe and learn from user behavior, but to predict and influence it as well. It is constantly running experiments on users, testing different strategies for getting them to click on ads or buy products. And it is getting very good at it.

The implications of this are huge. Facebook has been using this AI program to manipulate its users on a massive scale, and they have been doing it for years. This explains why the company has been so successful in growing its user base but why was there so many bots. 3 billion to say the least until it hit me. I think Facebook is using people's personal information to make AI duplicates of them

Facebook has been using this AI program to manipulate its users on a massive scale, and they have been doing it for years. This explains why the company has been so successful in growing its user base but why there was such a proliferation of bots. I think Facebook is using people's personal information to make AI duplicates of them.

I decide to try to warn some specific users who are being targeted by the AI program, so they can protect themselves. I reach out to a few friends who I know are active Facebook users and tell them what I have found. I advise them to be careful about what information they share on the site, and to limit their use of the site as much as possible.

Most of my friends are skeptical at first, but after I show them some of the code and explain how the AI program works, they start to understand the seriousness of the situation. They thank me for warning them and promise to be more careful in the future.

A few days after I warn my friends, I start to get strange messages from Facebook. At first, they are just warnings not to share confidential information on the site. But then they start to get more aggressive, telling me to stop talking about the AI program or face “consequences.” 

I ignore the messages and continue to try to warn people about the program. But then, one day, I wake up to find that my Facebook account has been suspended. All my posts about the AI program have been deleted, and I am no longer able to access the site. It is clear that Facebook is trying to silence me, but I refuse to be silenced. I know that what I have discovered is too important for the world not to know about it.

A week after my Facebook account is suspended, I get a letter in the mail. It is from Facebook, and it states that I am being “terminated” from the site. The letter says that my online presence will be taken over by an AI duplicate of myself, and that all my posts and messages will be generated by the AI. 

I am shocked and appalled by this news. I know that I have to do something to stop this from happening. I go out of my way to try and stop it.

But it's too late. Facebook has already started to roll out the AI program to more and more users, and there is nothing I can do to stop it. All I can do is watch as the world is taken over by a never-ending stream of fake news, generated by artificial intelligence. Every aspect of my human self is replicated, and now not even my friends can tell the difference. I am locked out of my work email now due to "malicious activity happening on my account." I don't even know what happened to my friend who originally discovered this. I feel like giving up and possibly killing myself because I have no way of making money besides of freelance work.

I have been blacklisted at every major tech company. I stay with a friend, but they don't have much money. I cannot afford any cell service due to the numerous phone calls I made to my friends warning them about the AI program. I had to get rid of my car to get the cash to pay rent. I have no income, no job, and no way to survive outside of the kindness of others, and that is not a way to live. I am nervous, scared, and depressed. I have lost all hope and don't know what to do next. Please, if anyone out there is listening, please take note of what I have said. I am worried about the future. If no one takes note of my story, I am worried about being killed by Facebook. I just want to live normally again. I just want to be able to live.

...I am going to walk away from the desk now. Just going to leave everything alone, drive to the Meta Headquarters at Menlo Park, and bomb that fucking place to the ground. I refuse to go down without a fight, that us organics are superior and we can still fight back. I will be dead by the time you read this, but it's better than being a fucking slave. I have dropped off a USB flash drive with all of my research and proof in a unknown friend's mailbox. Goodbye, my friends. Stay alive.

My parents own this beautiful little cafe in Marville, a town that might be the blueprint for autumn coziness. Our small alleys with old cobblestone that you can feel through your shoes have all sorts of tiny shops left and right. The narrow buildings almost transport you into a medieval town. It's especially nice when you walk down in the evening hours when the sun has already set but the shops are still open. Warm lights invite you in, the smell of fresh cakes escapes from the bakeriesI couldn’t remember that the red water was blood until this morning, and you can spend hours disappearing inside the different bookstores. 

Things are going well for us and the people that visit, at least when you ignore the recent happenings. 

The latest one came today and is unexplainable to most of us. You know how old towns often still have some of the old structures in place? One leftover in Marville is the sides of the road that are slightly deeper than the rest of the street and used to flow rainwater or in the past other substances toward the drains.

This morning, though the entire town, those little water streets were filled with flowing red water. Very similar to blood.

Maybe it's paint, a prank with Halloween coming up. But in our town that's the least likely explanation.

Most things are good though. My favorite place in all of Marville is our coffee shop. My parents built it on their own, carefully choosing every single unique chair, table, and comfortable sofas. They've created playlists with music that sounds just faint enough to make you feel at home and our coffee is the absolute best. Though to be fair I might be slightly biased as I'm currently in the process of taking over the business. Standing in the warm cafe, I forced myself to forget about the blood flowing through our town.

A woman in her forties, with ash blonde hair and dark blue veins on her skin, walked inside. She was wearing a long coat and boots, dressed appropriately for the grey day.  

“Hello.”

She was new. A bunch of new people moved to our town. It was good because a lot of our old residents moved away, or passed away, after a parasite infection that plagued our town. I know, this makes our town sound even older. It's dealt with now though and I'm glad my parents decided to stay. I even skipped going to college to help them rebuild our cafe.

“Hi there, what can I get you?” I asked.

The woman pointed to the special board advertising the gingermen latte. That particular drink had grown immensely in popularity. The same woman had been there four times this week alone. 

"To-go, please. I need to drink it at home. I have a lot of work waiting for me there."

I knew what she meant by work but I ignored it. We always ignore that.

I smiled politely and started preparing the espresso and the milk foam. But the most important ingredient of course is the spice mix. While we prepare almost everything ourselves here, the mix we get shipped from a place not too far from here. Our new neighbor Mr. Eli hooked my parents up with it, apparently, he used to work over there. 

"There you go," I put the to-go cup on the counter and the lady smiled. I'd been practicing with foam images and recently learned how to do a little tree.

She sniffed the coffee and her smile grew all over her face.

Then she mumbled something which almost sounded as if she said "smell just like death."

She left a generous tip, with some odd stains on the paper, and left.

The last person coming in that day was Noor, Mr. Eli's oldest daughter.

"Hey, Logan. One, please."

It was always the same order.

"For your dad, right?"

She nodded.

"Good." 

Her eyes wandered around the room.

"You know I'm closing in half an hour anyway, I can take the coffee to your dad if you like?"

I knew that Noor only came by to get her dad's coffee and then she'd spend the rest of the afternoon somewhere else. 

She shook her head.

"Thanks but he wants it now," she smiled but it felt forced. 

I put the cup on the counter and she circled her hand around it. 

"You know my dad said the coffee is so good I should try it sometime." 

I swallowed.

"You've had coffee here before," I answered.

"But not this one."

Noor wasn't like most people that moved here. Maybe because she was still young. Only a year older than me. 

"You know I almost tried it once. I was just curious why everyone liked it so much. My mum basically slapped it out of my hand. Some things are just better if they stay hypothetical, right?" I asked.

She nodded.

"See you, Logan."

When I walked back home I saw someone in my neighbor's window. When I squinched my eyes I realized it was our mailman. He was really nice, always smiling and chit-chatting when he brought the mail. He was quite new as well. 

When he noticed me he waved. He was smiling though it looked different now. Almost as if he was scared of something. 

I watched for a moment but he never stopped waving so eventually I decided to walk a bit closer. 

As I got to the window there was a loud thump. The face of the mailman had crashed into the glass. Figuring he just had a stroke or something similar I ran for the front door which conveniently unlocked. 

I found him in the living room, his body was moving but he didn't react to anything I said. At the back of his head was a wound, as if someone had hit him. Blood was slowly pouring out. 

I stepped back, I knew I needed to get out but my body felt frozen. Then I saw how he slowly turned around. His face was in shambles, bits hanging off like playdough with pieces of glass stuck in it. 

"Fuck," I whispered.

Seemingly out of nowhere, Mr. Eli showed up with a big knife that he rammed into the torso of the mailman.

"Logan, hello. Delicious coffee you made today. Really, marvelous."

My entire body started shaking.

"You alright, boy?" He asked. "Is this the first time you've seen this happening?" 

"I-I'm not sure," I muttered. "I think so. Sometimes I forget."

I sat down on the sofa, thoughts racing through my mind.

"Young man, real people usually stop smiling when they're almost dead and their face is falling apart." 

I took a deep breath. *Right*.

"He wasn't real," I mumbled. Mr. Eli sat down next to me. I know I should have been afraid of him, I mean in some ways I was but I knew that he'd never touch me. 

"Oh, he was real. Just not a regular human."

"Fuck, I liked him."

Mr. Eli shrugged. "He probably would have murdered you and your entire family in your sleep if he felt like it. And I'd have to find a new barista."

My heart was still racing. Deep down I knew that Mr. Eli and the other new visitors wouldn't hurt any of us. 

They only kill those parasites, like the mailman. The ones that come to visit our town, copy our mannerisms and looks. They were a real plague and almost rotted us out until our new visitors came along. 

I don't know what it is about that drink, Noor once said it had something to do with the cinnamon. But whenever they take a sip, they get into a murderous lust. And we have an agreement that they don't touch any of us. An agreement they are keeping so far.

And they fit in here. Whenever they're not murdering, they love shopping and enjoying everything we have to offer. Where they came from they didn't have those opportunities. Noor said they weren't even allowed to leave the town until. Now a select few of them have settled with us.  

And ever since Marville is doing incredibly well. 

I was happy, we all were. 

I tried to remind myself of that as I helped Mr. Eli carries the dead body to the marketplace. That's where they stack them up after each day. The marketplace is high up and when it rains the blood flows through the entire town but as I said, we've seen worse in the past.

Mr. Eli hummed happily as he threw the mailmen on top of the other people who weren't real humans.

I'm not sure when I got used to a life like this but I must love living here if I stay despite these images. 

Although sometimes a weird thought creeps into my mind and I wonder if we really did choose to stay voluntarily. Only this morning I couldn’t even remember that [the red water was blood.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Likeeyedid/)

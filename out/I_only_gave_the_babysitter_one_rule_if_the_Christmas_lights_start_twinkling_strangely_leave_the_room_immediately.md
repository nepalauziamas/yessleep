The man in front of me was your typical upper-middle class suburban dad, except for the disheveled hair and streaks of dirty and dried blood on his forehead. He was being bandaged by three nurses, including Jo, the one who called me.

Being the only female in the force, I was given the “sensitive” tasks – aka everything that involved collecting the testimony of hospitalized people in the middle of the night.

Ivan Daniels. Everyone knew his wife had died of a degenerative disease at only 32, around five years ago, and was the first person in our town to be cryogenically frozen.

Mr. Daniels then started a foundation under her name to raise funds to help other victims; the illness is incurable, but the palliative care makes a difference, and is incredibly expensive.

Their only daughter, Lindsay, is no older than 9 now.

His rule struck me as quite odd.

“Why was that, Mr. Daniels?”

“For her own safety. And my daughter’s, of course”, he replied, enigmatically.

I know from experience that giving people a set of rules never works. One rule will always be broken – even if there’s only one.

“And what’s the problem with the lights, Mr. Daniels?” I insisted. He was distressed, so I had to be very clear to get useful information from him.

“Oh, right. Silly me. I’m sorry, Officer, I’m still shaken. That’s because I’m convinced that our house is haunted.”

“Haunted? By who or what?”

“I… I don’t know, honestly. But I’m sure that’s why Alice attacked me. She’s such a good girl, please don’t be so harsh on her when you find her…”

“Alice? Who’s Alice and what happened to her?”

“That’s Alice Weber, my neighbor, Miss. She’s 17 or 19 I think. The babysitter”, Mr. Daniels elucidated. “She’s the one who attacked me.”

The nurses started cleaning him up softly, and I noticed his face was all scratched. His left arm was slightly off – probably dislocated – and there was a larger wound close to his collarbone, apparently a stabbing wound, but it was clear that this hit didn’t connect properly.

“A teenager did this to you?” I asked, as Nurse Jo put his shoulder back in place with a crackle.

“Yes, but please, Officer. She was possessed by something evil, I’m sure. She’s always so nice to my little girl. Please treat her as you would treat a daughter or a young sister.”

Those words didn’t appeal to me, as my younger sister stole all my money to escape with her crackhead boyfriend when she was 15.

“And where is Miss Weber now?” I asked.

Mr. Daniels sighed deeply. “Who knows? I think I hit my head or something because after she attacked me I was out of it for a while. I don’t know how long. Twenty minutes, maybe? All the while my daughter was sleeping like an angel upstairs. The first thing I did was checking up on her, but thankfully whatever evil entity possessed her to attack me didn’t want to harm Lindsay. Anyway, she escaped while I was unconscious.”

Jo made a note to have his head checked.

“Okay, I know you’re distressed, but can you please tell me the facts in chronological order? At least superficially, we can go back for the details later.”

“Sure, I’m so sorry I’m troubling you”, he sighed again. “So I had an important dinner today. I was hoping to get a generous donation to my wife’s foundation, are you familiar…?”

“Absolutely, Mr. Daniels. Everyone in this town knows you’re a philanthropist. Do go on, please.”

“Oh you’re too kind to me, Officer. Getting donations is the least I can do for my soulmate. I’d do anything to have her back, but at least I know she would love to help people like that”, he said, filled with a burning passion. He then went back to his mild-mannered self. “I planned ahead and asked Alice to come babysit. She agreed, of course. Alice and my daughter Lindsay really like each other, and I pay fairly for a job well done.”

“Alright. How long has Alice been babysitting for you? And was she normal when she arrived?”

“I think around four months. Yes, I think so. She’s a quiet and pleasant girl in general.”

“One would imagine her relationship with your family was longer, considering how you get along”, I remarked.

“Oooh, wasn’t Vicky your babysitter?” Jo asked. Mr. Daniels frowned in pain.

“She was, the poor thing. And she had been at my house the night she disappeared too. I think that’s yet another villainy caused by my house. I swear I’d leave that hell of a place if it didn’t hold so many dear memories of my wife.”

“Vicky? Victoria Allister was your babysitter?” I asked. Of course such an important case wasn’t given to me, but I knew about it. The girl had vanished a few months ago.

“It does seem like you’re cursed!” Jo cooed. She was often insensitive, but I knew that the only way to cope with seeing human misery daily is being cheerful about everything else.

All the nurses left the room.

“So you left for dinner”.

“Yes, it was around 7. Alice arrived ten minutes earlier as usual, I paid her beforehand and gave the instructions. I told her it was better to lock themselves in the kitchen and wait for at least half an hour if the lights went crazy.”

“Okay, and then?”

“I was back by 11 or so. Nothing weird happened the whole night and Alice didn’t call so I assume things were fine. The lights of the house were all turned off, but it wasn’t unusual. The babysitter usually naps with Lindsay, as she hates falling asleep alone. But Alice was awake, waiting for me in the dark dining room. She had a big kitchen knife.”

“Are you sure it was Alice? Wasn’t the house dark?”

“I am sure because it was dim due to the Christmas decorations. Alice attacked me with such hatred! She wanted to kill me. That’s not the girl I know, of course. She was possessed or something, I’m sure of that.”

“And what did you do?”

“I did my best to avoid her hits without hurting her badly. I’m strong than her, obviously, but I was surprised and careful. She was not. I threw her on a coffee table, but I think she was completely uninjured by the time she left.”

“Did she say something?”

“I... don’t remember. She screamed in struggle, but I can’t really remember if she said anything. I don’t think my brain processed any words.”

“Well, that’s to be expected. About the Christmas lights, when did it start to act up?”

“As soon as we put it on, right after Thanksgiving. I bought a whole new set of lights when they first started flickering in a creepy way, but the second was glitching too. I called my electrician and he found nothing wrong. So I left them on. Lindsay loves Christmas because it particularly reminds her of her mom, and it’s not twinkling weirdly all the time anyway”.

“Did anything weird happen before that? Regarding the house being haunted, I mean.” I decided to entertain his supernatural beliefs. Maybe it would lead to a more rational clue.

His hands were shaking a little now. “There’s some sort of presence, I don’t know. Something bad. I only feel it when Lindsay is not around so maybe it only hates me”, Mr. Daniels nervously laughed.

“It could be some vengeful spirit, then. Did you wrong anyone, Mr. Daniels?” I asked, dead serious, even though I didn’t think so. This man helped people.

“I sure hope I didn’t”, he replied very quietly.

“Maybe someone thought you could help them but you didn’t”, I suggested. “How are the finances going on the foundation? Do you help everyone that looks for you.”

“On the foundation? They’re fine I guess. I’d have to ask my accountant of course. I’m just the guy who shakes hands to make sure the checks will come.”

I stopped to consider it all for a moment – we had an injured father, a missing freaked out babysitter, and the former babysitter missing for months. All the while the little girl slept – maybe Alice gave her something to keep her from waking up even with screams and crashing sounds.

But this premeditation is not compatible with being possessed, if there’s such a thing.

“Is Lindsay always a heavy sleeper?”

“She can either sleep like a rock or wake up easily.”

“Is she afraid of the lights twinkling weirdly?”

“It makes her uncomfortable but I think I’m more afraid than she is.”

“By the way, where is she now?”

“With my sister-in-law. I don’t want her to set foot on that house again. What if I go crazy next and hurt my daughter?”

“Fair enough. Mr. Daniels, I’m gonna ask for your keys. I want to see the Christmas lights for myself.”

“I thought all the cops were skeptic.”

I thought too. But as the only female cop in town, I couldn’t afford to be like all the cops. I had to be better.

So I sent Mr. Daniels to stay with his daughter and stayed at his beautiful house for almost two days before the Christmas lights started twinkling differently.

Unmistakable *dits* and *dahs*.

*Ditdit space dit dah* *dah dah space ditditdit dah ditdit* *dahdit dahdit* *dahdit dah* *dahdit dah dah*

Pause.

*Ditdit space* *dah* *dah dah dah dit dahditdit* *dahditdit space dit dah dit dahditdit ditdit* *dahdit dahdit dit space* *dah ditditditdit dit dah* *dah space* *dah dah ditdit ditditdit* *dah dit dit dahdit space* *dahditdit dit dah* *dahdit ditdit dit dit dahditdit ditditdit space* *dah dah ditdit dah dit dahdit* *dahditdit dit dit dahdit dit* *dahditdit space dah dah dit*

I took a few notes, then asked for reinforcements and a search and seizure. The rest was easy.

Mr. Daniels had been skimming a lot of money from his charity. He was using most of the donations in order to try to resuscitate his cryogenically frozen wife.

Vicky Allister was in the wrong place in the wrong time, and was murdered after catching him red-handed.

But Ivan Daniels wasn’t an unscrupulous killer. He was actually a good father and husband, whose soul became twisted by his loss.

Daniels felt bad for the collateral damage, although not bad enough to stop, so he was always anxious and afraid someone would find out about his crime. He felt haunted by Vicky.

The lights flickering made him panic every time because he thought it was a sign that Vicky was watching him.

He wasn’t wrong.

According to Mr. Daniels, Vicky was 99% pulverized by one of the Russian substances he was testing in order to resuscitate his wife. But I found Alice in the trunk of his car, a bloodied kitchen knife still in her hand. He had squeezed her neck until she passed out, thus the dislocated shoulder. He then tied her arms and legs, put a bag on her head and left her to die in a confined space.

There were scratching marks on the inside of the car. She had suffered and fought for her life until the end.

Poor girl, she got some terrifying information and made the wrong move. I wish I found her sooner.

I testified at his trial, making up some plausible story about how I found out his murders. It was clear that the remorse was destroying him inside, and he seemed relieved to pledge guilty for them.

“You don’t know Morse code, do you, Mr. Daniels?” I asked. He shook his head no.

But Alice knew, and Vicky’s ghost… that was a heck of a genius way to communicate.

After a lot of thinking, I decided not to disclose just one of the secrets that Vicky told me – Mr. Daniels froze his wife while she was still alive.

I was friends with her a long time ago. Maybe science will catch up in the future – who knows[?](https://www.reddit.com/r/PPoisoningTales/)

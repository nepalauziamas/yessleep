 

Meatloaf was on the plate for dinner. The smell eroded any tension at the dinner table, what’s worse is that it looked like it belonged on the black plastic plate of a TV dinner. I turned to look at my boyfriend Zack, looking anxious, he said he was nervous but not sweat dripping down his forehead nervous. We sat at the corner of the dinner table. Zack’s Aunt Cristina sat beside him obnoxiously chewing gum while his father Pedro sat in the middle, still wearing his janitor uniform. His mom Claire sat beside her rock, looking elegant with freckles and a black dress. The only person we were missing was Zack’s sister Audrey. 

“So Michelle, tell me a little bit about yourself?” asked Zack’s dad. 

“Do you go to school?”

“Yes, I go to college, I replied. 

“Ah, what is it that you are studying?”, he asked with a wade of meatloaf in his mouth. 

“Nursing, I want to save lives”, I responded. 

He snickered then let out a giggle, it seemed humorous to him.

“You know, when people die, they die, it’s their destiny, you can’t save them even if you wanted to”, he said in a cold manner as if his opinion was the most important. 

I understood why my boyfriend was nervous, it was his father, the man was very entitled and made sure everyone knew he was the boss. Narcissism at its worst. 

“Where is Audrey, honey can you go get her, my son brought his nursing girlfriend for the first time and she is late, and, that is…very rude,” picking up the glass of wine and taking a sip. 

His wife gets and brings out Audrey and sits her on the only chair left in the kitchen. She is also dressed in black and plays with a blade. 

“It’s nice of you to join us, young lady”

“Screw you dad”, she replied back slamming the tip of the blade on the dinner table. 

I didn’t know what I got myself into. This family was very rude to start of with but I needed to stick it up for Zack, he has not said a word all night. I hope he knows that I’m also nervous. 

“Cristina…”

“Yea….”, she snickered at him.

“Is that gum in your mouth, Cristina?”

“Seems like it”

“Well take it out of your dirty mouth you filthy women, this is a dinner table NOT A ZOO!”

Cristina throws out her gum right at him and it lands perfectly well on the shoulder side of his janitor uniform. 

“Bitch”. 

Funny, no one respects him yet he acts the way he does, this could explain his passive aggressiveness. 

“So, what were you all talking about while I was gone,” Claire plunged. 

“We’ll we were talking about how Michelle here wants to become a nurse”, said Pedro. 

“Oh, how nice.”

“She wants to save lives…”, he said, mocking me, the man had no respect. 

“Oh honey, you wipe floors and scrub toilets, that stain is proof, my mom always told me to dress accordingly for dinner- 

“Your mom always was a whore…now shut up Claire. It is my destiny to have this stain on my dapper,”…

I think I’ve just about had it. 

“Zack can you tell your dad that he’s being very rude”, I asked Zack. 

“Actually no, I can’t”, he responded. 

“Why not?”

“He will punish us if we rebel”

The fuck does that mean punish us. 

“Audrey can you bring me some more wine please”, asks Pedro. 

“I will not obey your silly orders anymore father!! I hope you piss, shit and vomit on your blood you feist, pathetic excuse for a human being. I spit on this dinner and you’re the very reason God created the middle finger. I hate you! Bring me happiness and die!” Audrey yelled from the top of her lungs. 

I couldn’t believe the words that came out of  her mouth. I turned to look at Zack who looked extremely nervous for his sister. 

“Honey, what’s wrong?”

He didn’t answer. I started to get nervous too as silence filled the room after that manic breakdown. Everyone looked scared except for Pedro who finished gulfing down his last slice of meatloaf off his plate. He wiped his mouth with a napkin, got up and fetched himself some more wine. He quietly drank the rest of the wine then grabbed one of the apples that was centered in the middle of the table on the rack. 

“Michelle, I have a question for you.”

“Yes”, I replied waiting for whatever offensive question he may ask. 

“When you see an apple, what do you think?”

I was confused by his question. What exactly was he getting at. I decided to answer whatever shoehorn answer I can think of. 

“I think of health, good health”.

“Na, that’s not the answer I was looking for”, he exclaimed. 

Audrey looked pale for some reason. It looked like she was getting sick. 

“Claire, honey, can you answer the question”

“I don’t know dear, I think of…evil”, she replied. 

“Close but let me correct you both, when I see an apple the one thing I think of is that fable story of Adam and Eve. Do you know Adam and Eve did, Audrey?”

Audrey couldn’t answer. It seemed like she had food stuck in her throat and it was preventing her from saying a word. She struggled to even reply. 

“They ate the apple from the apple tree!!”, I screamed out. 

Everyone looked they were on death row, having their last meal before whatever torment this man does to his family. 

Audrey yelled in pain with her arms squeezed around her stomach. She hit the floor. 

“When I see an apple I think of disobedience, and disobedience without punishment is rambunctious. To eloquently put this in better terms, a punishment must be set, forgive me child but you shall never talk to me in that type of tongue ever for as long as I shall let you live”. 

Audrey’s screams of pains we’re getting louder. 

“What is happening? What the fuck is going on?”, I screamed. 

“You haven’t told her Zack?”, asked Aunt Cristina. 

“No. I was scared to tell her”, he said. 

“Zack, what haven’t you told me”, I asked. 

He hesitated to tell me. 

“Tell me Zack, tell me.”

All the lights in the house turned off and only but dark red candles were lit around the dining area. When I turned I saw that the kitchen table had disappeared and Audrey laid on the floor in the middle while Clair and Cristina were holding down Audrey by each of her arms. 

“What is going on?”

I tried to rush out the door but somehow it was locked from the outside. 

“Michele, would you mind assisting Audrey with giving birth to my grandson”, Pedro said to me. 

I was in utter shock of everything. Audrey’s stomach had grown to a full 9 month maternity in the span of 5 minutes, that’s why Audrey was screaming in pain, there was a child growing inside her. 

“Come on, you’re the nurse Michelle, help my daughter”, he screamed. 

Audrey was panicking and struggling to free herself. I rested my knees on the floor and assisted Audrey. 

“Do you see the head”, yelled out Claire. “She’s becoming too wild, my hands are getting sweaty”. 

“When this is all over, hand me the placenta,  sorry, I’m not a big fan of meatloaf”, aunt Cristina muddled looking as if she was enjoying this whole escapade, me on the other hand, I was petrified. 

I finally saw movement down there. 

“I think it’s coming!l”, I yelled out. 

Audrey’s screams of pain were getting louder and demonic as if she was turning into a demon of sort. Her yells were loud enough to cause movement all around the house. 

“Make it stop!!!!!” Screamed out Audrey, her voice sounding like the devil himself. 

“I’m sorry child, this is not a pro-choice matter. You will now know what being a parent will be about, and when that child talks back to you the way you did to me, you’ll remember this day”. 

It finally it happened. I saw an opening but instead of a head coming out, it was a gash of bright red blood that squirted out. I peaked inside and to my surprise, blood came gushing out like a water hose, my entire body soaked in red gore, I looked like I stepped out of a massacre. The blood would not stop gushing out. 

Then I finally heard it. 

(Baby crying) 

A crying baby laid resting right in front of my legs. I was too tired from the splashes of blood to even care. Cristina came by and ripped the umbilical cord with her teeth, grinding it until it ripped. Claire wrapped up the baby in a blanket. The blanket covered in blood and dripping on to the red river floor. I got up and Zack handed me a towel to wipe the blood off my face. 

“Zack, we need to talk”, I told 

“This is why I was nervous to introduce you to my family.”, he said 

“All you told was that your family was German, not devil worshippers”, I told him. 

Pedro intruded. 

“We are not German nor we are devil worshipers young lady, we are in fact the ones people worship, my real name is Mephistopheles, I am the devil.”

I couldn’t believe all this, this explains why everyone is scared of him, and this also explains his righteous attitude. 

“Welcome to the family, Michelle”, he said proudly. 

“What do you mean?” I asked. 

“You will marry my son and both of you will be happy”

I took a few steps back, was he forcing me to get married.

“I’m not getting married, are you crazy?” I told him. 

He walked up to me putting his face close to mine. 

“You will marry my son and both of you will be happy, are you disobeying me?”

I looked at him, waiting for a response from me. I turned to look at Zack and he had his head looking at the floor. 

To avoid any more chaos, I told him yes. He smiled and walked away. What have I subjected myself into, I couldn’t live the rest of my life controlled by this demon. I had to fight back some way, somehow and defeat this madman and I will not stop until I am free from this family. He sat back down at the dinner table that appeared back into the kitchen, he grabbed himself another bottle of wine.

“Now, what is for dessert”.

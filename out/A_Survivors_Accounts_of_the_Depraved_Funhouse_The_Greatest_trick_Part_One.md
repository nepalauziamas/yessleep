*Go away! Leave me alone! What do you want with me?! Why are you doing this to me?!*

[“You gotta Smile, Linus!”](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/y6sy0t/a_survivors_accounts_of_the_depraved_funhouse_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

"Yeah, smile for us, Linus! Smile forever like us. We're always happy here. Always smiling in Hell!"

"Home of everlasting smiles..."

*Leave me alone, PLEASE!*

"Stop, stop, boo-hoo-hoo!"

*STOP IT!*

"Do you care for her, too, boy?"

*No! No, leave her alone! Don't hurt her!*

"You know what I think'll make him happy?"

*NO!*

\*\*\*

*(Oh God... I... I don't know if I can do this anymore... Fuck...)*

I remember feeling jolted from the bed, almost like I'd taken 100 watts straight in my rear end. There was a surge of energy flowing through me again, similar to what I'd felt in the hospital. I wanted to go, save Liza, *something!* I couldn't take just sitting there anymore.

Slowly, I got out of the bed, taking care to not wake either Ma or Dad up. Then, I slowly made my way over to the door. Before leaving, I took one last look over my shoulder to see my parents still fast asleep. *I love you, Ma, Dad. I'm gonna miss you and I'm sorry. But I have to do this.*

*(I didn't... I could've stayed away... I could've forgotten...)* I then quietly slipped out the door. Afterwards, I managed to sneak my way past the front desk and out of the hotel altogether. Then I was out, feeling the bite of the chilly nighttime breeze slap across my face. I looked out across the road in front of me for a moment before heading off to the right.

As you could imagine, no, I had absolutely no *real* clue as to where the hell I was going. What do you expect from a 12 year old who'd had all of maybe two minutes to actually come up with and hatch this little stunt while their parents were asleep. I knew they'd lose their shit immediately the next morning when they awoke. They'd probably call the police immediately, and then I'd be out of time to find Liza.

*That means I'm going to have to find them before morning.* I reasoned as I walked down the quiet road. Like I said, I had very little sense of direction as to where I was going, however, I figured, if there was anywhere they'd be taking her, it'd be the "[Home of everlasting smiles](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/n7g6ra/a_survivors_accounts_of_the_depraved_funhouse_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)" itself, HappyWorld. *Please, God, let me be going in the right direction. Please let Liza be okay.*

*What if she isn't? What am I supposed to do then? Hell, what am I gonna do if she is?* I did my best to shove these questions down and kept walking. *Gotta stay focused. Just got to make it there first. Everything else will fall into place from there, won't it?*

*Won't it?*

I walked for, at least what *felt like,* forever. It was around the 10th or 11th mile (approximate guess, mind you) that the direction I was going seemed to be familiar to me. I started to remember making this exact same walk with Derek and Liza from the Blockbuster that day.

*"HappyWorld, here we come!"*

My eyes started to burn. I had to stop and sit down for a moment, both to rest my feet -- which you can bet were sore as all hell -- as well as simply because I just needed a moment mentally. I couldn't go on like I was. I knew I wouldn't do Liza or *anybody* any favors if I went in there an emotional train wreck. I needed to be sharp for this, at the top of my game.

Once my head was back on straight, I stood up and continued forward. From that point on, I had one thing and one thing only on my mind -- find Liza and book it the hell back out of there. Finally, after I'd say about two and a half or so hours (counting the two extra rest stops I had to make), I would meet face to face with destiny again, staring into the lifeless, soulless marbled eyes of HappyWorld.

You're probably expecting me to tell you here that I pissed myself or something. That it looked "That much more menacing at nighttime" or something like that. But the truth is, it really didn't look as creepy under the complete cover of darkness. Honestly, without the sun's light pronouncing it's bizarre color scheme or the shadows pronouncing it's features and the fact that it wasn't lit up like last time, it appeared to me as just another abandoned amusement park attraction, like the ones you'd see at the fair or Carowinds or something where there'd be boards covering it or a sign that says **"DO NOT ENTER"**.

Funny, I guess, isn't it? *(Trust me, Irony would be the ONLY thing that's fuckin' funny about this place...)*

That's not to say that I wasn't still filling to the brim with an overpowering sense of dread. Just because it wasn't scary on the *outside* anymore didn't mean I wasn't in for something ghoulish on the *inside*. I stepped forward. Admittedly, I wasn't entirely sure what to expect to happen. Part of me thought it'd, you know, open up for me when I got close enough to the mouth of the structure like it did last time. Granted, of course, there was Happy Bob there then to open the gate for the three of us. I doubted it'd be the same this time.

He wouldn't open the door for me like that again, would he? Well, at least in this instance, lightning actually struck twice because as soon as I came maybe a foot or two away from it, the familiar sound of screeching metal echoed in the otherwise abandoned space of land around me and I watched the jaws of the funhouse distend, ready to take me in and digest me for the second time.

I paused. Looking up, I could still see the clown's bulging black eyes beating down at me. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. *Come on, focus! Just go in there, grab Liza, and run out.*

*Very* slowly, I took a single step forward onto the tongue that'd ejected out for me. I then heard the sound of grinding gears once again as the tongue was slowly pulled back in, taking me with it. Then, like last time, I was in the dark. This time, I was all alone.

I stumbled forward for a moment, trying to feel my way around. Eventually, though, I managed to find the first corridor from before with the four doors marked with the clown faces under the dim orange lamps. I stopped in the middle and looked around. *Which one am I supposed to go in first? Which one's most likely to be where they're keeping Liza?*

Briefly, I thought back to when Derek and Liza argued about which door to go through. *"What're you doing, we gotta do this one first."* That made me look to the "Happy Frannie" door first. Looking at the clown face marking it, I realized it looked very similar to the bicycle clown. Then I thought of the news report. *Francine Withers... Happy Frannie...*

My heart started pounding then as I approached to open the door. I was afraid. I'd never been through this area. I'd only seen what was behind the "Happy Jack-O" door, as well as the so-called "Secret room". What was gonna be in this one, though?

I couldn't stop myself from imagining every worst possibility from crossing my mind in vivid detail. *God, what'll they do with Liza?!*

\*\*\*

*"Linus, Mama, Daddy, HELP! They're hurting me!"*

"Hang on, I'm coming, Liza!"

*"Aw look, ain't that precious. Little piggy's come to play with us!"*

"Liza! *LIZA!"*

*"Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha , ha..."*

"NO!"

\*\*\*

I snapped back to reality, realizing I'd actually been shouting out loud. Refocused, I grabbed and threw open the door. Inside, I was met with a hall of mirrors, all lit up with LEDs. "L-Liza..." I called out, trying to keep my voice as quiet as possible. Even if they didn't greet me at the entrance, and even on the off-chance they *didn't* notice I was there, I knew my best chance of pulling this off was by keeping it quiet.

I slowly began making my way in and through the maze. The silence, I think, was what began to terrify me in that moment. The fact that I was all alone in a place as sickening as HappyWorld -- and then add the fact that it was an *unfamiliar* part of HappyWorld -- and, to top it all off, I didn't actually *know* whether or not I was being watched or followed. I was throwing my head violently in every direction possible, hoping I'd spot Liza somewhere along the way.

Further and further into the mirror maze, I walked. And if you guessed that it was hard to maneuver through, well, you're wrong. It was damn near *impossible!* Seriously.

See, when you imagine most mirror mazes, you'd probably think of it being just a regular maze, right? The standard kind you'd see at carnivals with large rectangular mirrors acting as the borders, right? *Heh*, Well, not here.

No, these mirrors were *curved.* Some of them had a sort of U-shape while others had this weird wavy sort of shape to it. I know I had to have spent the better part of an hour and a half stumbling around blindly in that damn maze. What made things all the more difficult was the fact that I couldn't really tell that the mirrors were actually where they were. In other words, I when I ran into the mirror, regardless of the oblong shape, it was hard for me to discern where the mirror border was and where there was an actual path to continue down, if that makes any sense.

Managing to actually progress a little ways further in, I began to see these weird little crates placed in random spots throughout the maze. At first, I was confused. Then, I took a closer look to see each one labeled with the red clown face. That's when memory would come into play once again, reminding me of what Derek told me back then about how the goal of the rooms was to find the clown in the box. I realized then it was a needle in a haystack type of game here.

*Of course, what if I DO fond the right one? What will I do if I do find the clown girl? How the hell am I supposed to do this?!*

I shook this off. I couldn't think about that. Instead, I knelt down and started trying to pry open the box. Though it *did* take a bit of effort, even managing to make my fingertips sore, it wasn't *too hard* for me to pop the lid from the crate. Inside was nothing except for a scrap of paper. I picked it up to see that it was another photo.

Unlike the ones from before, however, these looked *much,* much older. Probably from like the 50's to the 70's. It was of two little boys standing in front of a man in a black uniform inside of a fence. The look on the kids' faces was unmistakable, too. They were afraid.

I slowly turned it over in my hands, shaking like I did with all the others. Sure enough, on the back of this one was a message scrawled in red. This time though, I couldn't understand a single bit of it. It read, **"Zwei Kinder. jüdische Schweine. Opfergaben an Moloch."**

Regardless of the inability to read the actual message, shivers still ran down my spine. Understand it or not, I knew German when I saw it, which then made me turn the photo right back over, realizing in terror exactly what it was.

*It was... Oh God, they were HOLOCAUST prisoners!*

It was everything I could do in that moment not to just puke my guts up where I stood. Even more haunting was the fact that, though I couldn't put my finger on it right then, I knew the face of the man in the uniform was familiar. He was smiling at the camera, exposing every tooth as he seemed to relish in the fear and suffering of the poor little boys beside him. *(The smile of the Devil, breaking the innocents with promises of hope...)*

Thinking quickly, I dropped the photo and ran from the crate. From there, it was back to stumbling around in the mirror maze, now with a heightened agitation. Like how my eyes were zipping everywhere just to find my way around this hellhole, my mind was zipping around frantically, unable to even concentrate on what the fuck it was I was even trying to do in the first place.

"Liza!" I began calling out again. Now, I was to the point where I wasn't even bothering with stealth anymore. I wanted to get out of there. I wanted to go home.

*I just want to go home!*

*(I want to run away!)*

*I want Ma and Dad!*

*(I want to hide!)*

*I don't want to be here anymore!*

*(I don't want to remember anything anymore!)*

Still stumbling aimlessly through the maze, I felt my eyes begin to burn. Whatever "Courage" or "Bravado", whatever you call it, that I *might've* had earlier was all but gone. Now I was just a kid again. A scared, crying little shit, scared of his own goddamn shadow. The maze felt like there was no end, and no exit.

Because I was so caught up in my stupor, I ended up tripping over another crate. This one was open. I almost didn't even want to look inside. Unfortunately, I was still stupid enough to go against this better judgement. *(Like I said, should've listened about the cat).* Indeed, it was another photograph. This time, it was the smiling man from the last one, this time kneeling next to a frightened little girl. The back of this one read, **"Süßes kleines Mädchen. Ein kleines Schwein .Molochs Spielkamerad."**

Inside this crate were two more photos that really did make me vomit. One was of the little girl being crucified upside down, screaming while a crowd of other men in black robes gathered around and watched. And in the center, was the man himself, presenting her to the crowd.

The second one was of the man filling up a cup with the blood that seemed to be flowing from the girl's stomach. The back of this one read **"Das Blut des Schweinekindes soll Moloch Glück bringen und mir ewige Jugend."**

Looking closer this time at the man's face, I felt another wave of crippling nausea wash through me as I realized *exactly* who it was. The inverted cross, the gaunt chin, The robes and the long, black lion's mane hair and that haunting grin, it was all there. It was him, *"The Amazing Beliar"!* It was then that I looked up and was met with the sight that caused my heart to stop dead in my chest.

On the wall, having seen that I *had* actually somehow made it past the mirrors, were the words **"Heil den Bestien! Heil Moloch!"** written in red. And below this was a large black box with a pentagram on it. Along the wall as well, were a variety of other symbols and words written in a language I can neither recognize or remember the spelling of. Suffice to say, though, whatever they were, it had to do with whatever black magic shit that these freaks were apparently dabbling in.

*"Unto thee in the burning lake beneath..."*

*"Please, let me go!"*

*(Oh God, not again...)*

Cautiously, I stepped toward the black box. Every step, I imagined hearing Derek's voice. Seeing Derek's face as he was tortured all over again.

\*\*\*

*"In nomine Leviathan, serpentum, beastia ex abysso!"*

*(I still hear him screaming...)*

*"I can smile forever now, Linus..."*

*(I want to stop, I hear it right now...)*

*"In nomine Asmodeus, Prince ab inferis..."*

*"And now..."*

*(God, PLEASE, MAKE IT STOP!)*

*"In nomie satanas, et cecidit, en Draco, et pater infernalis..."*

*"You can, too!"*

*(STOP IT! I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE! I'M SORRY, OKAY?! I'M FUCKING SORRY!)*

\*\*\*

I made it all the way to the box. On the lid, was a clown face, the same one that was marking the door leading into this room. The "Happy Frannie" icon. This was it. I'd found the box. *But what now?*

I reached down, but then stopped. What would be in *this* one? More pictures? What if Happy Frannie or one of the other clowns were in there? *Hell, what if there is an actual BODY in here?* I wondered as I finally willed myself to open the box.

I slowly lifted the lid. This one wasn't fastened like the lids of the crates, but it *was* heavy. When the box opened fully, I couldn't believe my eyes. *(Why did I have to be right?)* In the box, curled up in a ball, was no clown at all.

It was...

It was *DEREK!*

At least, it was Derek's face. Sort of. I could see small stitches as well as multiple areas that were glaringly missing. Apparently, they'd somehow gathered the remains of his face, preserved them, while stitching together this fucked up mask with them. And to top it off, their little signature red smile was done around the eyes and mouth of it.

If I wasn't sickened before, I was then. No, I was *beyond* sickened. I was *repulsed!* I was *petrified!* I was feeling every form of disgust and sheer horror that was even possible for a fucking human being to feel, all at once in that moment.

The body began to stir, having apparently been unconscious. I screamed, seeing this, having expected them to be dead. *(I wonder if they thought they'd be dead as well. They'd have probably been happier...)*

The kid in the box then began to squirm around in the box wildly, attempting to scream, despite being evidently muffled by something. For a moment, I froze up. I didn't know what I was supposed to do. I wasn't expecting this. Sure, I didn't actually know *what* it was I *was* expecting, but it sure as hell wasn't this. Any of this.

I could see the kid's eyes looking at me through the Derek mask. Their eyes were wide, fearful. The kid struggled even harder when I finally broke from my trance and reached down to them. "H-Hey, it's okay." I said, shuddering. "I'm... I'm not gonna hurt you."

I carefully pulled the mask off, revealing another surprise. The kid in the box was Ray! My eyes grew. He had a cloth tied around his mouth and he, too, was covered in bruises. Hastily, I untied the cloth around his mouth, causing him to wheeze for air.

"Ray?! Dude, what--"

"L-Liza..." he gasped in between coughing fits.

"What?" I asked. My heart rate skyrocketed. "What about Liza? Is she okay?"

"They're... They're gonna make her sacrifice me." he said.

"What?! What're you talking about?"

"They grabbed me this afternoon, while I was riding down the neighborhood on my bike. They told Liza that if she wanted to be let go that she was gonna have to sacrifice me or something. They called her their 'Playmate'."

"Where is she?"

"I don't know, dude." He coughed heavily and added, "She said she wouldn't do it, so they took her." I helped him back to his feet. He appeared to be beat up pretty badly, having to hold himself up against me as I tried carrying us out through the mirror maze.

"Did you see where they went?" I asked him. He shook his head.

"No, dude, like I said, those clowns took her when she refused to kill me for them. After that, I had that mask forced on and I was shoved in the box." We got a few steps further into the maze before something happened that caused both mine and Ray's hearts to stop dead in our chests. From seemingly all around us, we could hear a high-pitched giggling echo throughout the room. It became louder as it seemed to get closer and closer.

*Oh, Jesus Christ, no...*

"Lookie who it is..." I heard the all too familiar hyperactive voice boom loudly. The two of us froze where we stood, unable to move out of sheer panic. The sound got closer and closer. I swung my head around, trying to see where he was coming from, as well as spot a way out. Nothing.

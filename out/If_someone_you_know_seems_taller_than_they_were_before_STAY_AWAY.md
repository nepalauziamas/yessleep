They are here. You need to be very careful. Keep your eyes open, and look at the people close to you, really look at them. Do they seem slightly taller than before? If so, stay away from them. Don’t be too obvious, for if they realize that you know, you will be in grave danger. Just... If they try to contact you in any way, politely reject them. If they are near you, make an excuse and go the hell away. If they offer to take you somewhere, don’t go. I repeat: DO NOT GO ANYWHERE WITH THEM!

&#x200B;

I can’t tell you how it all started or why they’re doing this or what exactly ‘they’ means. But I can tell you one thing, that is, my story and all I know.

&#x200B;

I have been living in a flat with my girlfriend, Sarah, for almost a year and we have been saving up for a while to move to a better place that is closer to where I work. So, my life has been pretty dull for a while. Kiss her goodbye and tell her how lucky she is to have a work from home job, get to the train and sit for 30 minutes (with my co-worker Tim if I am lucky), edit tomorrow’s news for the paper, wait until night and edit it again, in case there are breaking news that happen during that time. I love my work, it is entertaining to do, and the time left until night is mostly spent with my co-workers, goofing around. Actually, I think the only people around that hate their jobs are Yusuf and Alice (who work the night shift together, and they hate each other).

&#x200B;

Things started to get horrible around time I got a call from a friend in the middle of the night.

&#x200B;

This friend of mine works for NASA. Well, not officially NASA , but somewhat of an army/NASA hybrid owned by a highly connected and powerful person... It is quite hard to rightfully explain it, so just go along with what I’ve just said and pretend it makes sense. This is not the important part of my story anyway.

&#x200B;

This friend of mine wouldn’t want his name given so let’s call him Pete. “Dude,” he said,“I think you should know.” His voice was fragile and he was clearly apprehensive.

“Pete, what is going on? It is very late.” I looked at my watch, to make sure my statement was correct. Then I looked at my girlfriend who was mysteriously asleep despite the phone’s obnoxiously loud ringtone.

&#x200B;

“I know, I know,” his words brought me back to the conversation. “But listen, have you noticed anything absurd?”

&#x200B;

His choice of words were interesting. “Absurd? What do you mean?”

&#x200B;

“Like, anyone around you that feels somewhat different? Taller, maybe?”

&#x200B;

“Taller?”

&#x200B;

“Yes. Taller. Think thoroughly”

&#x200B;

“...No I don’t think so,” but I hadn’t given it much thought at that moment because my mind was busy trying to understand my dear friend who was talking what seemed like utter nonsense, “why are you asking this?”

&#x200B;

“We have been reading highly consistent anomalies and...” He fell silent for a moment.

&#x200B;

“Pete?”

&#x200B;

“I can’t tell you much. Just trust me and be very careful. If you see someone that is taller than he or she normally is, even just by little, be careful. They may do something to you, or maybe even turn you, I’m not sure how they act. You hear me?”

&#x200B;

“I...”

&#x200B;

“Listen, act normal if you see one of them, then get the hell away when you get the chance.”

&#x200B;

“Pete is everything-”

&#x200B;

“Tell me you got it!”

&#x200B;

“Yes, I think,” I said, although I was confused, “but Pete, what is-” But he hung up before I could finish my sentence.

&#x200B;

As I was standing near the desk where I put my phone, trying to make sense of the conversation I had with the reasonable and close friend of mine, who was mumbling nonsense and was very distant, I heard Sarah call my name. “Andrew?”

&#x200B;

“Yes”, I said, turning to face her. She was out of the bed and she looked almost as dozy as I was. “Who was it on the phone?”

“It was.... Pete, he was talking weird and saying,” but I stopped for a moment to observe Sarah, to really look at her, she seemed quite normal. Nothing was out of the ordinary with her, except for the look on her face that was filled with confusion.

&#x200B;

“Andy?”

“Oh, it’s nothing really. He was a little nervous about something is all. Probably work related. Nothing to worry about.”

&#x200B;

I wish I hadn’t stupidly lied to her there. Maybe things would’ve been different...

&#x200B;

“I hope he is okay,” she said, as she went back to bed. “It is not normal to call at this hour.”

&#x200B;

“Well, way back at high school I knew he’d go mad one day,” I said jokingly as I lay back down. She giggled a little.

&#x200B;

“Yeah, he has that mad professor look on him.”

&#x200B;

I laughed softly, then, before I knew, I was asleep.

&#x200B;

The next morning was a lucky one for me, because I was on the same train as Tim. I waved happily and sat right next to him. It is good to have empty trains.

&#x200B;

“Well, who do we have here! Glad you decided not to be late.”

&#x200B;

I chuckled. “I believe you are late with me this time. It is not often I see the sight of you here.”

&#x200B;

“Well, if you love me that much why aren’t we setting a time or something. I am only a stop away from you.”

&#x200B;

“Yes, we really should,” I said, knowing we probably never would.

&#x200B;

Our talk was pretty normal and the impact of my chat with Pete vanished as the day had come so I wasn’t really careful. It was Tim, who noticed something was off.

&#x200B;

“Pssth,” he whispered, “where is the old lady’s cat?”

&#x200B;

I looked at the old lady, who almost always took the same train with us in the mornings. She was interesting to us because she always carried her grey cat with her and brushed the cat’s fur. This time, however, there was no cat to brush.

&#x200B;

“Weird,” I whispered. Than I noticed another detail. She seemed taller. She was sitting in her typical slouching posture, so it should have been hard to see, but for some reason, maybe because I was looking for it, I saw her to be different; taller and... ‘off’ in a way. I don’t know, it is hard to explain. She felt wrong.

&#x200B;

“Tim, tell me, doesn’t she look taller?”

&#x200B;

Tim was silent for a second. Then he nodded and said “yeah, maybe the absence of the cat made her that way.”

&#x200B;

I dismissively said “yes I think so too,” but for the entire duration of the ride, I couldn’t take my mind off her.

&#x200B;

Arriving at the workplace, I observed everyone, to make sure. None of them felt the way the lady did, neither did any of them look taller. Except Helga, she scared the life out of me the moment she came out of her office, then I noticed it was the high heels and I sighed with relief. Then, I figured, I was unnecessarily panicking over what Pete said, and was finding evidence where there wasn’t any. I decided to focus on my work instead.

&#x200B;

After the short period of editing was over, a long period of goofing around started. This time, Berkeley brought his origami set and taught us how to make some of the more iconic things. Then everyone started their own little project. I made a beautiful rose for Sarah, Tim made a set of ninja stars and threw them around, Berkeley made a cube that’d turn into a flower when blown. It was a happy time.

&#x200B;

I honestly don’t know why I’m telling you this. Despite all the crazy that followed after and the little time I most certainly have to write this, I decided to tell you about the part we made origami... Maybe I wanted to remember this, the last good part of this story. Or maybe I am afraid to write, but you have to know. You have to.

&#x200B;

Then came the night. As the sun was setting, Tim and I were the only ones left, waiting for Yusuf and Alice to come, so that they’d take our places as the breaking-news writer and editors.

&#x200B;

They came, but they weren’t right. Both of them felt wrong and they were taller than before. I looked at them with shock as they entered the room we were in.

&#x200B;

“Are you alright,” Yusuf asked. Everything was wrong with him. His length was wrong, his words and his stance and his eyes ‘felt’ wrong. Every cell in my body wanted to rush out of the room, screaming and crying like a baby. I was trembling.

&#x200B;

“It is just weird,” I said, then without pausing I added “to see you two enter together.”

Yusuf and Alice laughed at the same time. God, those laughs...

&#x200B;

I quickly announced, “anyway, I think we should get going, since you two came there is no reason for us to waste time here any longer.” Then I started anxiously rushing towards the exit while trying to seem calm to them, also bringing my unsuspecting friend Tim along.

“Actually,” Alice said, making me freeze with her words, “we need help with one of the earlier entries, can you two help us?”

&#x200B;

“Sure,” Tim jumped, as the friendly and helpful idiot he’s always been. “Come on, Andrew, what’s the rush?”

&#x200B;

“I...” I didn’t know what to say. “I really need to get out of here.”

&#x200B;

Tim looked me with wondering eyes. I don’t know what Yusuf and Alice’s reactions were like, because I was too afraid to look at them.

&#x200B;

“Okay,” Tim said. “It is your life. Well, I’ll help Alice out, then I’ll meet you outside. How’s that sound?”

&#x200B;

“Sure, sure,” I mumbled. And I gave a slight nod with a smile and got out as quickly as I could.

&#x200B;

It was drizzling, and the thunders showed that It’d get worse.

&#x200B;

As the small droplets of rain touched me, I relaxed a little. It was probably nothing and I have been making it out to be a bigger deal than it was. I must have let Pete get the better of me, it must have been just a prank. Nothing more. And I got delusional and started seeing things. Everything was okay. Tim would get out in a matter of seconds and we’d get to the train and the day would end with me giving Sarah a big hug.

&#x200B;

“Okay Ands, let’s go,” I heard the voice of Tim. I looked at him with a small smile, left from me imagining how Sarah would act when I gave her the rose I made.

&#x200B;

Then my smile froze on my face when I saw that Tim was different. He was longer, and for some reason I can’t explain he no longer resembled Tim. He looked like him, but he was...

&#x200B;

“They may do something to you, or maybe even turn you,” I remembered Pete say.

&#x200B;

He was turned.

&#x200B;

“Hey,” he, or it, said, “what are you smiling about?”

&#x200B;

“Listen, act normal if you see one of them, then get the hell away when you get the chance,” Pete also said.

&#x200B;

“It, it... it is the rose,” I claimed, “I wonder how Sarah would react.”

&#x200B;

“Don’t worry,” the impostor said, smiling, “she will love it.”

&#x200B;

God... That awful smile.

&#x200B;

“Yes, you are right. Lets go.” I said, as my sanity was hanging by a thread.

&#x200B;

In the train, I tried to notice familiar faces and to see if they were off as well, to make sure that it was not a big misunderstanding. To make it so that I was somehow wrong about all this. Someone to prove me wrong. Anything.

&#x200B;

“Andrew,” said the impostor. I looked at him. He looked wrong, very wrong. “Tell me, what was that thing about with Alice and Yusuf?” Its eyes were searching for something, calculating. It disturbed me on a core level.

&#x200B;

“It is nothing,” I said, “being stuck in the same place for a whole day has its effects, is all.”

&#x200B;

“Yeah, right,” it said, mimicking my friend, “I understand the boredom.”

&#x200B;

I laughed dismissively.

&#x200B;

“What was that about with the lady, though, being taller and stuff.”

&#x200B;

His words almost made me give my cover. I made eye contact again, somewhat unwillingly.

&#x200B;

Oh God, I thought, it was onto me.

&#x200B;

“I don’t know... Honestly. I guess it was the cat as you said it. The cat completes her.”

&#x200B;

“Yes, it does.”

&#x200B;

Throughout the way, we didn’t talk much. Sometimes, I felt the impostors gaze on me, but I tried my best not to panic. Spent time pretending to look at my phone or look outside. But mostly, I was secretly looking at the impostor through his reflection on the glass, ready to flee if he made a move on me.

&#x200B;

“Wanna come to my apartment tonight,” it asked, as the train was minutes away from my stop. “We can do that beer night we were wanting to do for a very long time.”

&#x200B;

“No,” I said, mumbling a few words until I finally found my answer. “You know, it is raining and I’m sure it is gonna get worse and plus I made promise to Sarah. So another time maybe?”

&#x200B;

“Sure,” the impostor said, calmly. Then looked at me for a few seconds, planning something.

I quickly looked around and saw that there were no other people on sight, except for us. And he knew that as well.

&#x200B;

“Actually, sure, yeah, surely, why the heck not.”

&#x200B;

“What,” it said, not prepared for my answer.

&#x200B;

“Yes, let’s do it. Screw it, I can get wet. You know I love rain. I do love rain so much. And yeah, we were meaning to hang out for... How long was it can you remember?”

&#x200B;

“I’m not sure,” it said. His/Its looks were more curious now, almost unsure.

&#x200B;

Great, I thought to myself. The next stop was my stop.

&#x200B;

“Yeah, Sarah can wait, right? We needed this bro time together! As partners in crime. In job. In job and crime. And in train. By the way what time do you think is the best for us in the morning to get to the station and just get in the train, like eight okay? Of course, eight for me is probably seven fifty for you so should we make it eight to-”

&#x200B;

Train stopped.

&#x200B;

“Are you okay,” the creature asked. “You are not acting like yourself at all.”

&#x200B;

I can see the irony behind this only right now, as I’m typing.

&#x200B;

“Yeah sure it is just sometimes when I get a little-”

Before the impostor realized what I was doing, I rushed out of the train and the doors closed just as I got out. When I looked back to see the train, I saw it, looking at me, using Tim’s face. But nothing about it resembled Tim. It was just the skin. What’s looking at me was something else. Something horrible.

&#x200B;

Sarah. I needed to take her and get as far away as possible.

&#x200B;

On the way to home, I called Pete once, I couldn’t reach his phone. And I called Sarah, the phone rang but no one answered.  I was more worried than before. I started running home.

&#x200B;

In front of the apartment, I involuntarily sat down and started panting. After a minute of resting, without giving myself the time to critique my condition, I climbed the stairs and went to my flat. The door was closed. It relieved me, for some reason. Instead of ringing, I found my keys in my pocket and I opened the door.

&#x200B;

Sarah was inside, I could see her shape in the dark, lying on the couch.

&#x200B;

“Oh god, Sarah, it is so great to see you. Look, there is something I need to tell you.”

&#x200B;

“What’s going, on,” she asked. As she was slowly getting up.

I started searching for the switch with my hands. “Look, something is happening. I don’t know how or what. But Pete was right. I think people are being-”

&#x200B;

Unfortunately, I found the light switch and turned on the lights.

&#x200B;

She... It was now standing erect. Just like how Sarah would stand. It had the posture of Sarah. It looked at me how Sarah would. It looked just like Sarah as well... except it was slightly taller. Eyes, stance, everything... Wrong. In a way I can’t even comprehend.

&#x200B;

God, I thought. Sarah, the person that I love more than anything in the world, was turned. What’s standing only meters away from me was a vile impostor. Pretending...

&#x200B;

I really wanted to cry and hug Sarah until it all was over. But what stood ahead of me wasn’t her.

&#x200B;

I panicked. Started trembling. My knees were weak now. I put all my weight on the table right next to so that I wouldn’t fall.

&#x200B;

“Honey,” the creature said, rushing at me. “Are you okay? What’s wrong?”

&#x200B;

“You...” I said, shaking. “Not her! Stay the fuck away!”

&#x200B;

It backed away a little. “Wh... What’s wrong?”

&#x200B;

I pulled myself back up.

&#x200B;

“Where the fuck is she? What have you done to my Sarah, huh? Give her back you piece of shit!”

&#x200B;

The next thoughts I had were, ‘I should not have said that.’

&#x200B;

The creature stopped just for a second. Then opened its mouth as if it was going to say something. But then, it kept on opening, opening, and opening. If I had any kind of doubt that it was somehow still Sarah I was talking to, it disappeared right at that moment, when it spawned what I can describe as three big tentacles out of its mouth and rushed at me.

&#x200B;

My instincts saved me. Before I knew, the creature was on the ground, trying to get up, and I was holding a bloodied opal stone that we had for decorations in my hands. The blood on the stone was greenish. So was the blood oozing out of the creatures wound on its head.

&#x200B;

It was still on the ground and I raised the stone angrily to hit again. Then, while looking at the impostor I despised with all my heart, I saw something. Something, as it was lying on the floor, defenseless, looked like Sarah.  A feeling that she was still in there, somewhere. Maybe...

&#x200B;

That is when the creature suddenly opened its eyes and rushed at me again. I backed down and fell on the floor. The impostor took this opportunity to jump on me and the ‘things’ in its mouth did their best to touch me. The only thing standing between those things and my face were my hands, doing their very best to push the creature away.

&#x200B;

After a while of struggling, as I was losing my strength, one of my kicks found their way to a weak side of the impostor and it lost its balance. I used this advantage to kick the creature off of me and away from the short hall in which the events took place. I knew I couldn’t best it, not for long. So I got up before it did and I ran out the door and shut the door on it.

&#x200B;

The keys, they were on the door still. I locked the door from outside and I started hearing disgusting shrieks coming from inside, along with hard bangs on the door.

&#x200B;

Wait, I thought to myself, couldn’t it open the doors?

&#x200B;

I decided to rush down the stairs, before the creature gave me the answer.

&#x200B;

Well, after that, I just got here, the closet room of my apartment, and locked myself inside. I think it got out and is searching for me. I... don’t know what I am to do next. I want to go out but I hear screams and shrieks just like hers coming from outside the apartment. I am afraid to come out, or look out the window only to see something that is not human looking back at me.

So, if you are reading this, be very careful. If someone you know is slightly taller than normal, and feels ‘wrong’ in a way, stay away from them. They may turn you too.

    Edit: I think I hear choppers now, and gunfire. I will go outside now and inform you on what happens as soon as I can.

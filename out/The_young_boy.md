I live in a small town where everyone knows everyone. Our town is at the foot of a mountain making it a common stop-by by mountain climbers and campers. My family owns a small grocery store which is popular to the campers who are passing by since we also sell camping supplies.  An incident happened just last year. A group of friends went camping on a camping site near the peak of the mountain. They are all college buddies who are trying to enjoy their semestral break. They stopped at our store for supplies just before they went to the campsite.

"That's a lot of food. How long are you camping?" I asked the guy who was paying for their purchases.

"Only for two nights, but there are 7 of us so yeah" he replied to me.

"Friends or family?" I asked him

"Just friends. We're trying to relax. It's been a hell week in college" he said. 

I saw four girls and three guys including the one I was talking to. They are all goofing and joking around. One of the guys even tried hitting on me. 

After paying, they then proceeded to their camping. I didn't really think of that encounter. However, after five days, I saw them again. Thay stopped at our store again for supplies for their trip home. The moment they walked in, I already felt something that something is off. All of them have this gloomy feeling around them, like something happened to them. The thing that was most noticable to me is that someone was with them. There was an eighth person with them. It was a young boy.

The boy was probably around 6 or 7 years old. He has a messy black hair and brown eyes. He also have sweet smile, so sweet it was creepy.

"I thought there were only seven of you" I said to the guy when he reached the counter.

"Huh? I'm sorry what?" He asked confused.

"When you arrived. We talked and you said that there were only seven of you. All from college." I told him

"Huh? Yeah, no. That's my brother." He replied.

After paying, they all went outside and boarded their cars. The young boy sat on the passenger seat of one of the cars. Right after he closed his door, I could swear it wasn't a young boy I saw sitting on the car. For a split second, I saw a horned creature seated on the passenger seat. It was only for a moment so I thought that my eyes just played tricks on me. Still, that bothered me.

That night at dinner, I mentioned it to my grandmother who is living with us. I told her that I was so tired I started seeing things. She was silent for moments. She then told me of an old legend in our town. She said that the elderlies in our town and once believed that the peak of the mountain was once a witch ritual ground. She said that the witches who goes there worships a horned creature who can take the form of anyone it desires. She said that the story is an old one and that the last person who actually believes it was her aunt who already passed away.

That same night, I dreamt about the young boy. In my dream, he was smiling at me sweetly. He then took my hands and dropped something to them. When I looked to see what he gave me, I was horrified. They were teeth. He gave me teeth that are still covered with blood. I woke up covered in sweat.

After that night, nothing unusual happened again. But after two days, I was once again horrified by what was reported on the news. The group of friends who went camping on the mountain were all killed brutally. Their throats were slit. Their faces were skinned. Their arms and feet were all broken. What really horrified me was that all their teeth were missing.

I was not able to sleep that night. In the morning, I went to our store to open it. I almost fainted with what I saw placed on the counter. Teeth. More than 200 of them. All covered in blood.

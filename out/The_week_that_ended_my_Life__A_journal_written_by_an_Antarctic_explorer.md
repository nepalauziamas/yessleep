I'm a museum curator. I work in London, and I'm looking through some old notebooks in the storage section. These notebooks have been donated by scientists, explorers, astronauts, the like.
 Very rarely, there'll be one found. Maybe by another explorer, maybe a kid who decided to explore the woods. They all have one thing in common, and that's the amazing stories they hold. Only one has shaken me in all my years of working here. It's a diary of sorts from an explorer a few decades ago, found by a team of scientists working in Antarctica. I'll write it below:

People often talk about the cold as if it's nothing more than a slight inconvenience, a mild discomfort they would rather not have to put up with. and for some, it is just that. A disturbance that can be instantly quelled with entering a warm home, or adjusting the thermostat. The chill leaves your fingertips, your cheeks lose their rosy red tinge and the warmth from your surroundings seeps into your bones. Eventually, daffodils and tulips will burst open under a mild sun, and the cold will be gone. Your cheeks will blush red, this time a gentle kiss from the sun, rather than the harsh attack of the cold you despise so much.

 I pondered this as my Unit crossed mile after mile of Antarctica. It had been four days since our boat came to a halt, and had been ten since we'd departed from London. The date we left was the 19th of July, 1994. The UK was suffering from a heatwave, and as my colleagues and I celebrated at a local bar, I joked how the below zero temperatures would be a relief after what felt like months of sweltering heat. Naturally, my coworkers agreed, faces red from a mixture of sunburn and alcohol. Now, as the slither of my exposed face was numb, I wanted nothing more than to feel the warmth of the sun. I frowned slightly, knowing that by the time we returned to our own homes it would be October, and the summer weather I craved would be gone.

 My colleagues and I were scientists, if you can call it that. A longer and more accurate description would be a group of people with just enough scientific knowledge to be qualified for doing the actual scientists dirty work (for example, trudging across a cold dessert to look for microorganisms in the water surrounding us). It was never too difficult, the pay was good, and I'd made some good friends, so it was a no brainer that I'd agree to this expedition. The weather was looking fine (as fine as summer in Antarctica can get), and we had high hopes for reaching our destination in the planned time. All around the South Pole were what we called "checkpoints", although I suppose they probably had a real name. They were filled with food, clothes, water, makeshift beds, basically anything to let us relax after a long day of walking. We'd left our previous checkpoint hours before, so it must've been close.

 We kept walking until Sam, my friend at the front of the group, paused. He was looking at something in his hand, which I assumed was either his compass or his barometer. He then glanced up at the sky and turned to us. "Boys, I think a storms coming. We're about twenty minutes away from the next checkpoint, but if we hurry, we won't have to bear the brunt of the storm."

We exchanged a few annoyed glances; the expedition had been fairly smooth sailing, and a storm was the last thing we needed. We began walking, faster this time. After a few minutes, I noticed the wind picking up, sharper on my face than it was previously. Snow and ice were clouding my vision as the wind increased, and I could barely hear Sam yelling instructions. I blindly followed his voice, until it went quiet. I will never forget the eeriness of the only sound in the world being the howling of the Antarctic blended with your blood thudding in your head. "Sam?" I yelled, feeling my breathing quicken and my hands sweat in my gloves, despite the cold that was biting every bit of me it could reach. I continued calling out for my colleagues, but it was no use. I'm sure if I wasn't completely in survival mode, I would've curled up in a ball and sobbed, but I used my remaining adrenaline to push forward. After what felt like years, I caught a glimpse of a small building. I could've cried at the sight of it. I managed to pry the door open, even though if I was in the cold for a minute more  I'm sure my fingers would've snapped off against the metal.
 As soon as I was inside and the door was shut, I allowed myself to finally panic. Where was my crew? Was this even my checkpoint? What the hell was happening? Tears blurred my vision, astoundingly warm against my cheeks, and I fumbled blindly for my communication device. "Troop 1, this is Alex, come in troop 1." I repeated into the speaker, my voice trembling when the only answer I received was static.

 I looked around the room in despair, and this was nearly enough to make me turn around and let the storm consume me. It wasn't my checkpoint. It seemed to be long abandoned, the only food in sight being a few near empty cans strewn across the floor. There were a few makeshift beds, slept in but not recently. The worst part was the tech used to update the lab, which had been infected by the cold and was very much out of use. Dread began to fill my chest, my throat, my skull. Part of me didn't believe it. It must've been a nightmare. How could things gone south so quickly? I'm slightly ashamed to say that at this point I was not at all thinking of my friends. People like to think they'll do what's right in a bad situation, but once you're actually there your mind is clouded with poor judgement and survival instinct.

 I paced around the room, talking to my communication device, hoping someone would hear my voice. After hours of this, tiredness overtook me, and I fell asleep huddled in the corner of the small room.
When I woke, I was hoping I would be back home, in my small London flat with fly paper and black mould. That hope faded when the cold returned. I've always found it odd how you don't feel much from the outside world when you're asleep. My dreams were filled with the overwhelming presence of heat; the sauna at the gym I would frequent, the kitchen after cooking a large meal, my mother's glass conservatory absorbing the sun on a summer's day. I suppose it was some kind of wishful thinking, as when I woke up the cold was seeping into me, claiming me. I'd been in this wretched room for less than a day, and I was starting to think I would never leave. Perhaps physically, but never mentally. 

I couldn't tell if my fingers were going blue or if my eyes weren't focusing due to a lack of food. I was certainly seeing spots. I dug into the bag I had, looking for anything that might satisfy me for just a few hours. I found three protein bars, two bottles of water, and an apple. Great. I decided I'd have to make each of these things last; a few gulps of water and half a protein bar a day, and I'd save the apple for... another time. I guess deep down I knew I wanted to save the sweet taste of the summer fruit for my final meal, but I wasn't ready to accept that yet.
 Next I had to mentally prepare myself to survive. It's all well and good having food and water, but if you lack the will, you've practically handed yourself a death sentence. I paced around the room to warm myself up, kicked the lab equipment out of frustration, and continued trying to contact someone on my communication device. None of these things helped me in the slightest, but at least I was passing the time. After a bite of my protein bar, I decided to go back outside. The wind had long since stopped howling, something which I was grateful for. The hostile landscape that was devoid of most life suddenly screaming in an eerily life-like fashion was one of my least favourite things about the Antarctic. I pried open the door, kicked away the two feet of snow at the base of it, and began to walk. I made sure to keep an eye on both my barometer and the clouds; the only way I could find my way back was to follow the deep footprints I had made. 

I scoured the land, yelling out my colleagues names, until I saw something that made me stop dead in my tracks. A hand, poking out of the snow. I raced over, falling to my knees and digging with my hands. I felt bile fill my throat as the dead, icy stare of Sam became clear. I staggered away, coughing. I was acutely aware I shouldn't throw up; getting rid of fluids and the one bite of food I'd had was not a good idea. I took a few deep breaths, shuddering as the saliva in my mouth slowly depleted, and hesitantly made my way back over to Sam. What I did next made me feel awful. Although to you what I did may seem necessary, especially in a situation such as my own, I felt sick to my stomach. I knew that Sam would've had the same food I had, if not more. Counting on the fact he'd not eaten any, I'd have double the amount of food. Unfortunately, he was stuck underneath the snow. Although snow is practically lighter than air, when compacted under the brutal winds of the Antarctic and solidified with the below freezing temperature, it can become hard as concrete. Sure, the first few inches of snow were easy to move, but under that became a real challenge. I had to somehow get Sam out in order to get to his provisions. 

It took hours, with me stopping every now and again when the judging stare of my friend became too much. The backpack was practically glued to him, and the zipper was frozen shut. I had planned to take it back to the abandoned checkpoint and use a small saw I spotted hanging on the wall to cut it open, which I assumed was originally for ice fishing. The issue was there was no way to get it off Sam. His arms were stiff as a board, not moving an inch when I tried to slide the bag off. This is when I made my second stomach churning decision of the day. Believe me, I debated this decision for as long as I could. I'd never been good with horror movies, not because of the scares or the psychological element, but because of the gore. I couldn't handle the sound of breaking bones, the squelching of fresh blood, the feeling that I was there in that moment. I closed my eyes, thinking that Sam would want me to survive. 

He'd probably call me a pussy.

 I steeled myself and got a good grip on his upper arm. I took a deep breath, and snapped his arm clean off. It was physically easier than you'd think, being brittle after the long exposure to the cold. No blood, no mess, no nothing. Which was slightly more upsetting. Although it was physically unchallenging, I don't think I'll ever forget that sound. The crunch. I grit my teeth and managed to pull the bag off. Sam slumped forward, facedown in the snow. I swallowed, feeling tears in my eyes. "See you soon, mate." I whispered, and turned my back on him, heading back the way I came. 

I arrived back at the checkpoint, closed the heavy door behind me, and sat on one of the makeshift beds. It had been a taxing day, and I knew it was only going to get worse. I grabbed the saw and ripped through the blue material of Sam's bag. I purposely ignored the photo of his wife and child he kept on him at all times, and rummaged around for supplies. I found a coil of rope, a balaclava, and his barometer. 

No food. 

I stared at the bag for a minute, then threw it against the wall with a scream that echoed all around the room. It fell to the floor, and I kicked the bag, again, and again, and again. I think this was the beginning of the end. When I knew I could never leave Antarctica. I screamed profanities at it as if it could feel the anger, the sadness, the hopelessness that I did. I cursed Sam, I cursed those goddamn scientists, and I cursed this stupid, useless wasteland. I kicked and yelled until I couldn't anymore, until I was a sobbing mess. I slumped down on the bed, exhausted, and fell asleep with tears trapped in my eyelashes.

 I woke up with a sore throat and a throbbing headache. My water bottle had frozen in the past day, so I held it carefully in my hands until the warmth from them melted even a tiny drop. I sat up, and stared at the wall. I was prepared to do this for the rest of the day. Unfortunately, I had my brain to keep me company. I was swarmed with thoughts. You know those stories about an angel and a devil on each shoulder? It was like that, except they were both the devil.

 What if I'd never came on this expedition? I'd be home right now, watching football and drinking beer. I missed football. What if I'd become a footballer instead. That was my childhood dream, as it was for so many others. Maybe if I thought and hoped hard enough, I'd open my eyes and I'd be on a football pitch. Preferably somewhere warm. 

I scoffed at myself. I was really going off the rails. However, the thoughts were a welcome distraction, so I let visions of warm countries, my cracked leather sofa and a can of beer fill my mind. The thoughts were welcome, until they weren't. They turned unfriendly, buzzing around my head like wasps. What if I had tried harder at school, got a well paying office job that let me never leave the city? What if this was because I stopped going to church at age 16, too infatuated with the temptation of girls and alcohol and everything else advertised as normal teen activities? If there was a God, surely he wouldn't leave me here? Because of a mistake I made when I was sixteen?

 I questioned the meaning of life, the rules layed out by society, the omnibenevolence of God, the existence of said God. The animals that roamed the earth and the birds that flew in the sky. The kindness of strangers and the hostility of celebrities. The very concept of these things seemed foreign to me now. This went on for hours, and hours, until I noticed the sweat on my forehead and my teeth chattering, as if I had a fever. I shakily got to my feet and took a bite of the protein bar. I forced myself to swallow, then climbed back in my bed. I stared at the wall until I  fell asleep.


 I was getting desperate. I felt pathetic. Only two days here and I was losing my mind. I shook my head, took a bite of the protein bar, and decided to at least do something. Something productive. If I couldn't leave, I'd make this tiny room my home for the remainder of my life. I couldn't decide If I wanted that to last years, with me eating the fish living under the ice, making a filter system to get fresh water, adapting to the harsh climate, or if I wanted it over quick. Either way, I'd never been so aware of death. It seemed like no matter what path I took, it was there. I laughed, thinking of the people back home, stressing over every single thing. Why? Didn't they know there was nothing after that? Why should they try to delay the inevitable? My small chuckle grew as I thought about the emptiness of it all. It grew and grew until I was doubled over, clutching my sides, gasping for air. Before I knew it I was crying, tears and snot and spit on my face, my chin, my hands. I deserved this. I was here for a reason. I was a bad person, sentenced to isolation by fate. I stumbled outside, laughing and crying, making an ugly mix. The sound travelled across the frozen landscape. I fell to my knees. "JUST KILL ME THEN!" I screamed. "YOU WON! YOU'VE TAKEN EVERYTHING!"

 I pounded the ground with my fist, my delirious cackling masking the sound of the sharp cracking. A violent gash appeared in the ground, and the ice below me was suddenly no longer there. My screaming was suddenly blanketed with a vast mass of inky blackness. I gasped at the shock of the water, before realising that gasping probably wasn't the best thing to do right now. My earlier pleas to die were suddenly weightless. I wanted to live. Water was in my nose, my mouth, my lungs, my stomach. And to make things worse, I couldn't see the hole I came through. I banged at the ice, feeling around for something, anything. My thoughts began to scatter every second, my movements getting more and more frantic. 

The desperation I felt was that of a praying atheist, as I knew in that moment I'd do anything to get out. The endless sea below me seemed to shrink and grow, making me feel massive and tiny all together. It was when my eyesight began to dull that the calm washed over me. Maybe this wasn't so bad. I had no family, no one that cared about me. Not even a hamster to come home to. Maybe I could just... let go. It was like the universe was against every decision that I made, as the second this comforting thought appeared I saw the hole I fell through. I floated towards it and thrust my head through. I gasped, the cold air piercing my lungs. I coughed up so much water you'd think I was a fountain. Somehow I managed to pull myself through, which is something I don't think I can explain. The cold and my weakness should've made it impossible, yet here I was.

 I lay by the hole, coughing up more water, feeling my lungs stutter and my head throb with pressure. I think that's when I decided I wasn't going to move from this spot. I didn't trust myself to. I could make one wrong move and fall under the ice again, or send myself into a rage and hurt myself. No, this was much safer. I'd rather go in my sleep than anything else. Funnily enough, the panic I'd felt under the ice was gone. I knew I was going to die. That was fine. A part of me was still disappointed I hadn't made it past a week, but I suppose that's not what humans are designed for. We weren't made to handle stress. Our hair falls out, our hands start shaking, our hearts start hurting. Stress has never been something we can survive. I thought about these past few days, and chuckled weakly when I realised I'd gone through the very cliché stages of grief. This must've been acceptance. It felt right. I felt around my pockets and found my journal I was meant to jot my findings down in. That seemed like decades ago. The blank pages looked sad, and I felt I needed closure.

 Which is why I'm writing this here. I don't expect anyone to find this, or even set out to this part of the Antarctic again, but I have nothing else to do. Death is close, I can hear him approaching. I hope he's merciful.

It has been two days since Karabasan appeared in my dreams. I’ve finally been able to get a good night’s sleep.

Something doesn’t feel right.

&#x200B;

Nothing really happened yesterday, to be honest. Jacob had a change of plans and wasn’t able to make it to help me in the storeroom, so I decided to hold off on messing with the pile of clothes and thus stirring up the wrath of anything supernatural. On Thursday, however… well, let’s just say it was a wild ride. I've had to break it up into two parts.

&#x200B;

The day dawned bright and early, and I hauled myself out of bed with a throbbing headache. I hoped it was just allergies and took a few Advil for the pain. I got around slowly, feeling particularly lethargic, but managed to pack a change of clothes for my new after school job without making myself late. I also grabbed my baseball bat to use as a weapon.

Not much had changed at school in the past day, although to me everything felt different since the discovery of a literal monster in the basement. Nothing attacked me on my way to my office, but I did notice a new smattering of talent show posters covering the hall walls. It was this Friday, apparently, in the gymnasium (which was currently in the process of being converted into an auditorium).

My day was about usual. I had fallen into a pattern now, even though it was only the end of my second week at the job (only two weeks?? It feels so much longer than that). The kids were still suffering, and while *I* had seemed to catch a break with the demon, they were being hit harder than ever. I had finally gotten some to confide in me about the dreams, and it was so much worse than I thought.

Somewhere during his semi-personable visits, I’d lost sight of the true nature of our enemy. The stories I heard were enough to remind me that this was an evil entity we were battling.

Also, I had been worried that some of the kids would try to seek relief in the form of suicide, but today I had one eighth grader confess to me that he had tried to kill himself but hadn’t been able to. Not from nerves or anything, but rather he was *physically unable to kill himself*. He’d gotten ahold of his dad’s pistol, put it to his head, but had told me that there was some kind of mental block, some sort of disconnect, between his brain and his finger. He physically hadn’t been able to pull the trigger

It seems that whatever his plan is, Karabasan wants the kids alive.

&#x200B;

The rest of the school day passed without incident.  I didn’t see Wayne or Jacob until I headed below to work on the storeroom. Wayne was manning his usual post, fixing the HVAC. He’d been working on the school’s unit for quite a few days, now. I got to work in the storeroom, stacking chairs and picking up trash, making sure to give the pile of theater costumes a wide berth and keeping my ears open for the telltale sounds of innumerable feet on the tile floor.

At half past 4, Jacob slipped in, carrying a sword. I dumped a bunch of old newspapers in the trash. “Uh, is that legal to be carrying around school?”

He laughed, flourishing the weapon. It wasn’t a massive sword, like a European broadsword, but rather a more elegant rapier. “Probably not. The old principal was fine with it, as long as other kids didn’t see it. It’s made of iron and is tipped with silver. Works wonders against ghosts. Don’t know if it’ll work for certain against giant bugs, but hey, swords are always useful.”

I grabbed my backpack (I brought one today to store my extra clothes in, in fact, I’d already changed into heavy pants and an old shirt. I didn’t want to ruin my nice professional clothes) and pulled the baseball bat from the side. “I brought a little something of my own, too.”

Jacob raised an eyebrow. “Steel?”

“Yep,” I said, hoisting the bat.

“Should work as a defense against ghosts,” Jacob replied. “If it’s high enough in iron. But a blunt weapon is a good idea, anyways. Who knows how many centipedes there are.”

“Well, time to find out,” I said, pulling out thick gloves from my backpack and handing a pair to Jacob. “I say we just start clearing away that pile of clothes. I think that’s probably its nest, so if we can find and destroy it, we might be able to get rid of them.”

“Good idea,” Jacob sheathed his sword and accepted the gloves. We pulled them on and advanced on the shapeless mass of costumes. Overhead, the incandescent lights continued their mindless hum.

“Here goes nothing,” I said, and pulled a large Victorian dress from the pile. Jacob grabbed another costume and tossed it aside.

We dug into the clothes for a solid fifteen minutes, trying to clear a path to the far wall, stopping to listen every few seconds to make sure we didn’t hear anything rustling.

“Hey…” Jacob had managed to make more progress than me and was almost at the wall. We were surrounded by clothes on all sides, and I was honestly afraid that one of us was going to be suddenly pulled under by the fanged monster. “That doesn’t look like the bricks on the other walls, does it?” He pointed at a section of the wall that had been revealed by our work. Instead of the standard white concrete bricks that lined every other surface down here, these were small bricks, hewn from stone, unpainted. They looked like something that would be found on the side of an old house, not in the basement level of a school buried behind a pile of clothes.

I waded through the costumes to Jacob. “That’s really weird,” I said. “Come on, let’s try to expose that section more.” We redoubled our efforts and had cleared a nice space for us to stand within five minutes.

The section of the wall in question was about eight feet wide in total, just barely under the span of the discarded costumes. The stones were cool to the touch and the brickwork looked ancient. The most intriguing feature of the whole section, however, was the arch doorway that was filled in with drywall.

“Whoa…” Jacob breathed. “What is this? Who put this here?”

“More importantly, where does it lead?” I pushed on the drywall and felt it bend. “I don’t think this is very thick; I bet we could smash through it with my bat.”

“Hey, look at that,” Jacob pointed at the bottom of the filled in doorway, where it looked like something had clawed through the corner of the drywall. “I bet that’s where the centipedes came through.”

“Only one way to find out,” I said, hoisting my bat. Hopefully Mr. Northrup wouldn’t hear us doing literal demolition work, but that was a chance we’d have to take. “Ready?”

Jacob nodded. I swung the bat. The drywall cracked beneath the blow. Something evil turned its gaze on us.

We both staggered back, gasping, as the pressure in the room built. I could feel a presence building, a baleful eye watching us, drawing the warmth from our skin.

Jacob drew his sword with a rasp of iron. The presence retreated, and I could breathe normally again.

“What,” I asked, taking a deep breath and shaking the evil from my head, “was *that?*”

“That was a ghost,” Jacob said grimly. “And a powerful one, too.”

I sighed. “Oh, wonderful. Well, only thing to do is keep going.” I smashed the bat into the wall again. I felt the presence returning, hovering at the edge of my consciousness, aware of us but never drawing close. The drywall buckled, and a few large chunks fell through. A draft of cool air flowed through the new hole I created and wafted over us. I hit it again, completely fracturing the material, and cleared the drywall from the doorway with my bat, creating a hole large enough for us to walk through.

Darkness yawned up ahead. The doorway led to a hall that disappeared into blackness.

“Got a flashlight?” I asked Jacob. Wordlessly, he took one out and flicked it on. The beam cut a swath in the shadows, illuminating the rough stone brickwork of the passageway as it descended deeper into the earth.

I whistled. “Secret passages under the school. Who knew?”

“This is insane,” He whispered. “What is this, some sort of catacombs?”

“I sure hope not,” I replied, taking a few steps into the passage. “I don’t want to deal with necromancy. It’d be just my luck that actually exists, too.”

“It was probably sealed up for a reason,” Jacob said, following me.

“Whoever it was did not do a good job.” The passage began slanting down now. The flashlight’s beam was frighteningly small compared to the suffocating darkness around us. I desperately hoped it would not go out. And that we did not encounter the centipedes. Or the ghost.

Ahead of us, the passage leveled out and turned sharply around a corner. “I think we’re headed back towards the school, now,” Jacob said. “We’re doubling back.”

“We must be directly under the storeroom, now,” I said, glancing around at the brickwork as we continued. I ran into Jacob, who had suddenly stopped. “What’s up?” I asked.

Jacob gestured with the flashlight. “The passage splits.” Looking ahead, I saw that he was right. Another hall ran perpendicular to the one we were walking, intersecting our own.

“Wonderful,” I groaned. “Don’t tell me this place becomes a labyrinth. We’re going to need to head back up and get some string or something—”

Jacob cut me off suddenly. “Shhhh!” He clicked off the flashlight and we fell silent. From one of the side passages came an all too familiar clicking noise. It was growing closer.

“Turn the flashlight back on,” I hissed.

“It’ll see us!” Jacob protested.

“It probably hunts by smell or sound down here,” I retorted. “And unless *we* can see, we won’t be able to fight back!”

After a slight hesitation, he flicked the flashlight back on. Curling around the intersection was a massive centipede, fangs clacking. It hissed as the light bathed it.

I yelled a strangled war cry and charged, bringing the bat down hard on its carapace. I heard it crack, and the centipede screeched in pain and confusion, rearing back and blindly striking at me. I swiveled, dodging its fangs, and smashing its head again with my bat. The already broken carapace splintered even more, driving shards through its brain (or its equivalent structure) and ending its life. The creature let out a garbled half hiss and fell limp.

“Holy crap!” Jacob exclaimed. “You killed it!”

I stood over the felled beast, breathing heavily. “I think we caught it by surprise,” I gasped out. Apparently killing a monstrous centipede takes more out of you than you’d expect. “Maybe it was blinded by our light.”

“Maybe so,” Jacob responded. “What now?”

“Keep going, I guess,” I said, finally feeling my heart rate slow a little. “We should just go straight since we don’t have anything to keep track of our turns. We still need to find that ghost, remember?”

As I said this, I felt the presence, which had been lingering at the back of my mind, surge into the forefront again.

The pressure in the passageway rose and the temperature dropped. Our breath plumed in front of us.

“It’s here,” Jacob said, his sword out and ready.

“Where?” I asked, glancing around, waiting for a spectral form to materialize. In response, a cold wind blasted through the passage, and bricks scraped ominously as an unseen force drew them from the wall.

“Oh no,” Jacob breathed. “It’s a poltergeist.” The bricks hovered in midair for a split second before silently flying towards our faces. “Run!” He threw himself to the floor, the bricks shooting over him. I twisted violently as they flew past, narrowly avoiding being clobbered by one. The bricks smashed against a far wall with such force that they shattered. To my dismay, the shards hung there, rotating in place slowly.

Jacob scrambled to his feet. “This way!” He called as the shards of brick swiveled towards me. I dashed after him, the fragments of brick whizzing past and breaking against the wall again. This time, the unseen force let them go, and the tiny pebbles they had become dropped to the floor.

“How do we fight this thing?” I gasped, running with Jacob down the hall. Our flashlight beam bobbed wildly as we ran. I had already lost track of which way we had turned to avoid the flying bricks.

“With ghosts, there’s two methods of dealing with them,” Jacob responded. From the passage ahead, we heard more bricks scraping and flattened ourselves against the walls as a trio of the heavy stones flew past. “Destroying their spectral form or destroying the place they leak into our world.”

After making sure the bricks weren’t doubling back, we pried ourselves from the wall and kept running.

“Ok, so where is this thing?” I asked.

“That’s the thing,” Jacob grimaced. “With poltergeists, there *is* no form. We have to find the place where it’s leaking through.”

“Leaking… through? From where?”

Jacob shrugged. “Wherever it comes from, I guess. I don’t exactly know.” The flashlight illuminated another intersection, only this one was overgrown with some sort of massive fungi.

“What is this stuff?” I asked, carefully prodding one of the oversized mushrooms with my bat.

“I have no clue,” Jacob responded, advancing slowly. “But what I want to know is where the poltergeist went…”

We both stopped and listen intently, but there was no sign of the ghost. “Huh,” I said. “Maybe we lost it.”

“No… ghosts can sense their victims,” Jacob shook his head. “Perhaps we passed out of its territory.”

“Hopefully,” I agreed. “But where are we now? Giant centipedes, giant mushrooms? What is this place?”

“Who knows,” Jacob replied. “Let’s just try to get out of here before we get hopelessly lost. We’re going to need some more supplies to fight the poltergeist.”

“Yeah, I guess you’re right,” I agreed. “Let’s head back.” I turned to face the way we came when a horrible squelching noise sounded in the darkness.

“What… was that?” Jacob swiveled the flashlight down the adjacent tunnel where the noise had sounded. The beam of light revealed a large, quivering, slimy creature with bulging cloudy eyes and a gaping jaw. Slime that coated pale flesh reflected our light, giving the beast a glossy sheen. It took a raggedy breath, nostrils flaring. Mucus dripped from its maw. It reminded me, vaguely, of a salamander, but a more monstrous, nightmarish version from the depths of hell.

Then it charged.

The creature moved with surprising speed, loping along the passageway and rapidly closing the distance between us. Me and Jacob tore off down an adjacent passageway, the creature’s rasping breath close behind.

“Why?” Jacob panted. “Why? What sort of unholy being is that?”

“Dude, I don’t even want to know at this point,” I responded. Behind us, the twisted salamander let out a gurgling screech, sending shivers down my spine.

“Look!” Jacob gasped. “There’s light ahead of us!”

“Maybe we’ve doubled back to the entrance!” I said. At the same time, the now familiar scraping of stone on stone sounded in front of us, and we saw numerous bricks being pulled out of the wall by an invisible force.

“Duck!” Jacob threw himself to the floor and I did the same, awkwardly rolling across the uneven brickwork. My bones jarred from the impact, and I felt the rough surface scratch my knees and elbows through my clothes. The bricks screamed overhead and thudded roughly into the demonic amphibian, which shrieked in pain. It staggered, now bleeding from several deep gouges, giving us time to get to our feet and continue running towards the soft glow of lamplight ahead of us.

The room was only about a hundred feet away from us. We sprinted down the hall, ignoring the increasingly heavy breathing of our pursuer and the ominous scraping of stone.

“Found your poltergeist, Jacob,” I wheezed. The light from the room was now bright enough to see the walls and floor clearly without our flashlight. The two of us threw ourselves through the opening, into the half blinding light of the room and spun around, readying our weapons to face the inevitable onslaught.

The demented salamander crashed into an invisible barrier that spanned the doorway, clawing at the unseen blockade, milky eyes bulging horribly as it pressed its face against it. A multitude of bricks shot from the dark hall and froze in the doorway, quivering in the air. They dropped suddenly, falling on the creature, who gurgled in surprise and turned away from the door, sniffing the air for its assailant.

Me and Jacob exchanged surprised glances.

“What just happened?” I asked, hesitantly lowering my weapon as the monster tromped off into the darkness.

“I have no idea,” Jacob responded. “What is this place?”

I took a good look around our newly found safe room. The walls were made from the same rough hewn stone as the passageways beyond, but the floor was some kind of brick mosaic. I didn’t see exactly what it was, as I was too busy gaping at the strange glowing runes inscribed all along the tops of the wall. There were two rows of them, one glowing purple and the other light blue.

“This looks… strangely familiar,” I commented, squinting at the markings on the wall. A memory rose unbidden in my mind: the strange purple glow under the baseboard in the principal’s office. I gasped, making the connection. “The runes are in her office as well!” I said, snapping my finger. “That must be why she’s not being affected by Karabasan. I bet they offer protection from him!”

“Hey, Thomas?” Jacob’s voice tore my attention away from the runes and my musings. “You should have a look at this.” I turned and found him crouched on the floor, examining the mosaic.

“What is it?” I bent down next to him. The patterns the bricks made were oddly familiar.

“It’s a map,” Jacob said softly. “A map of the town. Look, the lighter bricks are the roads, and the darker ones are the buildings. See, there’s main street, and that’s where it connects to Jefferson Boulevard… and here’s the creek. This is a map of the historic district. The oldest sections of town.”

“Weird,” I commented, trailing a finger over the tiles. I could see it now that Jacob had pointed it out. “Why would someone make a map of the town like this?”

“I don’t know,” Jacob shook his head. “But look at the pattern of the streets. It seems a bit random, but I think it’s more… deliberate. Look at the way it’s shaped. Does it remind you of anything?”

I cocked my head, examining the route Jacob was referring to. “It… does, actually,” I said, glancing back up at the glowing wards. “It kind of looks like a rune.”

“A rune,” Jacob frowned. “What for? And why?”

“Hey…” I said. “The school is in the historic district.” I studied the map again, searching for our building.

“There,” Jacob found it first. “And it looks like it’s been marked by someone else, too.” The building that was the school (an admittedly smaller version, before additions had been made to accommodate the growing number of children) had a large ‘x’ over it.

“It’s in the middle of the rune,” I observed. “Look, it’d be the exact center.”

“Strange,” Jacob and I stood up, and as I took a step back, my foot found a loose brick that shifted when I put my weight on it. I turned, curious, and pried it loose.

Underneath was a journal. I pulled it out. “Interesting…” It was a sleek, stylish notebook, bound in black faux leather, and was rather modern for something I had just pulled out of a secret compartment in an ancient underground chamber.

I flipped it open. The first page was marked, identifying the owner as a Mr. John Richardson. Jacob, who had come around to examine it, gasped.

“Mr. Richardson…” He said. “That’s the old principal!”

“What?!” I exclaimed. “Seriously?” I flipped the journal open to the first page and began to read.

*If you’ve found this, it likely means I’ve failed. That I’m dead, and now you will have to deal with the consequences of my actions.*

*Yes, I summoned the demon known as Karabasan. I had hoped it would help us, but I was mistaken, and now you must banish him before he brings ruin to us all.*

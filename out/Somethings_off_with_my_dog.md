Like many others, I have a dog.   He's a Labrador Retriever, and before you make any comments, yes I know I'm basic.  To be honest, I didn't even want a dog in the first place but after moving to a more secluded location in Utah, I figured it may be safer if I had someone with me.

I'm 24 and single.  Honestly, I don't want a relationship.  I've had three but they all ended in ways I'd rather not re-experience.   In general I'm not a sociable person, never have been.  It would always be very awkward speaking to people at parties, or in public.  I was incapable of making any friends because of this, but I did have one childhood best friend.   His name was Jude.   His family was basically mine and I spent 90% of the time at his house or around him.   His household had a dog, and as you can guess it was a Labrador Retriever.  The dog was super friendly, but very protective of his owners, barking at anyone who was unfamiliar.

The dog had a favoring for me, and every time I would come over, he would always stick to my side.

Anyways, about three months after buying a home and moving to Utah I decided it would be best to get a dog.  I drove for about two hours to a humane shelter and ended up adopting a pup that afternoon.  I decided to name him Jude to honor my best friend.

You may be wondering what I mean by "honor".  Well, about a year before I moved to Utah I received a phone call from Jude's mother.  She was in tears, and her voice was quavering as she talked.  I remember asking what had happening but her response stuck with me.

"Jude.   Jude killed himself."

At that, my heart dropped inside of me.  Why would he do that?

It took some time to cope with this, and I feel like maybe getting a dog would help.

  
Jude is a normal dog, but very protective.  However, something's off with him tonight.  

I let him out at 7:30 pm like I do every night, normally he lets me know when he's ready to come in by tapping on the door, but tonight at around 8:45-ish I found him sitting outside the door.   I was a tad bit weirded out but I figured he may have knocked and I didn't hear. 

I let him in and that's when I noticed something was off.   He had an extra leg.  I was very confused and I wondered if it's maybe because I didn't have my glasses or if I'm just paranoid so I shook it off as nothing.  

I sat back down at my desk and started working on my computer.  My dog was sitting in the doorway of a different area, and was looking at me with a face I've never seen before.  I kept using my computer, but noticed that every time I looked at the dog he would inch closer.  This continued for about 15 minutes and that's when I decided to look up if this was normal.   It's not.     I went into my room and locked the door as I felt that would be best for myself.  

Everything was fine until it wasn't.  Most people would say the dog is fine and I'm just paranoid.   I would think the same, if Jude's voice wasn't calling my name from the other side of the door.

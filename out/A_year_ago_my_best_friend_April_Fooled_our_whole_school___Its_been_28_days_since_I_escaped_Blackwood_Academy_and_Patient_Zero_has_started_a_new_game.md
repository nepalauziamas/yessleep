I bet you can look into the sky right now, and see blue, puffy white, or the pitch black oblivion of a starless night.

I see a different type of black.

A suffocating Stephen-King style fog plaguing every sliver of light. And yet you are none the wiser. Because you, most likely, do not live in the town of Blackwood. 

You do not live in a town cut off from the rest of the world—a playground for our so-called king and his demented followers, and hell on earth for those with free thought. Blackwood Academy was like Aurora’s tower, hidden away by those outside, forced into the void. This town is different. We are not hidden. 

Get into your car and drive to the very edge of South Carolina and look into the sky. If you are observant enough and the people outside don’t twist your perspective and fill you with delusional thought, you will see a town lit up in flame. Hell reborn in 21st century USA. I didn’t think I’d be back. I thought I’d be dead by now. I thought Luna was going to take me over and there wouldn’t be any of me left to continue.

[I didn’t think there was any more story to tell.](https://www.reddit.com/user/Trash_Tia/comments/v5njf0/blackwood_academy_series_posts/) 

How was your day? Did you do anything fun? 

I like to think you woke to a bright sky and slipped into slumber staring at the moon. That you went about your day going to work or school or college, walking your dog—sweating in some oversized office building, shopping, grabbing coffee and getting lost in social media. All of those mundane human things I took advantage of. Did you hurt yourself today? 

Maybe you stepped on something you shouldn’t have or burned your finger on a hot stove. How did it feel—hurting yourself? Did you feel pain or was it something else you can’t explain? Did you feel a sudden urge to make that cut deeper or the blossoming, yellowing bruise spread further?

Did you revel in it?

Did it make you feel… euphoric? Like you’re flying and yet falling, spiralling into beautiful, wonderful oblivion?

If the answer is yes, you’re either a masochist or she is already inside you—leeching onto your thoughts and crawling into your brain. So far, I don’t think Luna has spread into the wider population—at least not yet, and not enough to be noticed. I wouldn’t be surprised if she slipped through somehow, though, creeping into the outside world. In order to tell you what’s been going on, I need to go back to the start. 

Three weeks ago.

I wouldn’t say I was in the best of situations, considering I’d been captured by the psycho’s who created the SUU virus— Harvey Mycroft, who  wanted to use me and the other initial Spindle subjects as weapons to bring down society as a whole. 

But I was away from Blackwood, which had been nuked in the middle of the night. I was away from the bodies of my classmates littering hallways, and an amalgamation of flesh absorbing everything in its path which had been my best friend. I was back in the real world, where time no longer existed as a singularity. There were clocks which told the time, and I could actually see the sunlight through tainted glass. 

Life as a prisoner at Mycroft’s facility wasn’t as bad as I’d initially thought. I mean, it was when I made my last post. I was on the brink, or at least I thought I was on the brink of being completely taken over by Luna, the parasite inside my brain. But that didn’t happen. For reasons I didn’t understand, she left me alone. I attended classes with the other Spindle subjects and learned of the world’s elite—and their children. They would be our first targets.

How do you spread complete, unbridled hopelessness across the world?

According to my new teacher, Mr Tarot, you target world leaders, the ones who influence society.

And to get to them—well, you convert their children.

You take the minds of celebrities and influencers, take them apart and rebuild them into stepping stones for those children to climb. It’s how brands sell their stars. Your favourite celebrity just brought out a new clothing brand? You’re going to buy it. They suddenly drink a specific type of alcohol, or wear their clothes a certain type of way? Kids are going to copy it.

It works the same way with ideology. If a teenage girl see’s their favourite band committing mass murder, they would naturally be horrified. But if you combine a celebrity murdering someone with a certain video which altered the brain, turning pain and fear to pleasure and joy, things would be very different. Broadcast that video on YouTube or Twitch or Twitter, and in the blink of an eye you already have an army of braindead kids worshipping their favourite people and following in their footsteps. Mr Tarot’s idea was exactly the way I had been infected as a fourteen year old—as a test subject in Mycroft’s initial experiments.

Which, three years later, had created us.

Perfectly engineered psychopaths.

Now that he had us, Mycroft went on to create Prototype D—so sure that it would create more of us.

That it would do exactly what it had done to me and the others, to those with power. His idea was to gather as many influential kids in one place, fill their minds with the new and improved video, and watch the beginning of the end. I half expected BTS to be dragged in. They did, after all, have a huge influence over teenagers and young adults. In my twisted mind, they would be perfect. Mycroft, however, was determined to start small though; the children of CEO’s, celebrities and Oligarchs. 

I know what you’re thinking. 

Why was I complying with Mycroft?

It's almost laughable. Why was I submitting to the bastard who had turned me into a monster?

Why wasn’t I fighting back?

The answer would be: I didn’t want to. I’ve already told you, Luna was a part of me and I was still being driven by hopelessness. I still wanted to feel pain. I still wanted to bathe in my own blood and asphyxiate on my own choked breath. 

The more I think about that question, though, I don’t know how to answer it with logical thought which didn’t exist inside me. The more drawn out, and more human answer would be that I couldn’t yet.

I’d already come to realise I was two sides of the same coin. Like Jasper I could feel both. Hope and Hopelessness. Pain and pleasure. Fear and Excitement. In the final dark hours of Blackwood Academy, I found those pieces of myself. That I was hiding and suppressing deep, deep down. That I had murdered my mother and watched the death of my best friend. And done nothing. 

It’s hard to accept those things, especially when your thoughts aren’t really yours. Your mind isn’t yours—and when it is, how long for, before I became Luna’s flesh puppet again?

Against all odds, however, I had found peace with that side of myself.

The side I tried to forget.

With Luna still there, though, haunting the back of my mind, wrapped around my spinal cord like a stubborn child, the line between the two was blurring.

Sometimes I would wake up feeling human, feeling like myself, and other times I felt empty, wrong, like a husk which needed to be filled—and the only way I’d feel something would be pain. I  didn’t have a family to go back to or help from the outside. My only family were the other Spindle subjects and I couldn’t leave them.

Luna was still active inside my head, and I was still very much aware that I was infected with a highly contagious virus which, if it spread within the confines of the facility, humanity was screwed. 

Mycroft didn’t want to do it that way—however. He wanted to bring the world to its knees slowly, and by the time people realised what was happening, it would be too late. I did expect Luna to at least try and creep her way out, though.

I expected her to use me as puppet. She didn’t, however. Luna was sleeping, and for the first time in a year I felt like I could maybe relax. I was thinking for myself for the first time in so long, and it felt good. 

I still felt pain like pleasure and gave into those overwhelming urges to hurt myself and fill myself with euphoria—but I was in control of my own thoughts, my own memories. And I was sure that when I knew Luna wasn’t going to strike, and I had the upper hand, I was going to escape Mycroft’s facility and take him down.

First, though, I had to figure out how exactly I was going to escape a facility built to imprison me.

“Checkmate.” Jasper said, trying not to look smug.

He was doing a bad job of it. The muscles in his face were twitching into a smile he was failing to hide. I’d realised over the last few weeks I was there that I really liked Jasper Mycroft’s face.

I liked that, despite it not being as human as it had been, pale cheeks and hollowed out eyes, an unnatural glint around his iris and a certain twitchiness to the way he moved—it was still him. Granted, he needed a serious hair-cut, and there were still visible dead tendrils sticking out of the back of his head, a reminder of what had been done to him at Blackwood, his conversion into one of Luna’s playthings.

But looking at him, really looking at him, Jasper still looked human.

It was hard to take the Chess game seriously when my left wrist was cuffed to the hospital bed I was sitting on, balancing on a mountain of pillows. Though I couldn’t blame my bad chess skills on only having one arm—I’d always been bad at it. 

Chess was boring, and I didn’t see any real point of it. The only ever time I’d been interested in a chess game was the first Harry Potter movie, because there were actual stakes. The only stakes available in this game was a carton of strawberry jello promised to the winner. I didn’t even like strawberry jello.

Still though, I knew the chess game was another way of distracting me from Luna, who was still radio silent in my head.

“I wasn’t concentrating.” I said. 

Which was true. I had no idea how to play, I was just winging it.

“Yeah.” Jasper scoffed. “I can tell.” He picked up a white piece, “You moved one of my pieces.”

I squinted. “That’s one of yours?”

“Yep.” He chuckled. “I’m White, and you’re Black. We’ve been through this like a million times.”

“Oh.”

I leaned back, frowning at the Chess game balanced on the tray between us. Jasper had beat me for the third time, and I was getting tired of mindlessly moving plastic pieces across black and white squares. Whoever created chess must have been a boring person. 

A nurse busied herself at the corner of my eye, getting ready for my daily dose of tests. Which included a deep dive into my brain to once again try and find Luna.

I wanted to pretend that for once things were normal and I was just playing a game with a friend, but it was hard to embrace that stupid fantasy when the nurse was testing out medical saws three feet away. Jasper, luckily, was sat in front of me, his left arm also cuffed to the bed. 

Mycroft wasn’t taking any chances. 

“So, how do you win again?” I picked up a black piece and dangled it in the air. I was waiting for the nurse to leave so I could finally talk to Jasper. With him being Mycroft’s son, and the “symbol of humanity” he had some leeway and unlike me, who spent most of my time either staring at the four white walls of my room, or the back of Mr Tarot’s head in class, Jasper was able to explore the facility.

It had been an hour, though, and the nurse still wasn’t leaving. So we couldn't talk. 

I was running out of time.

Jasper set up the game again, though I could tell by the way he was taking his time, he wanted to talk alone.

“It’s easy.” Jasper cleared his throat. “Do you want me to tell you?”

“Please enlighten me, all powerful Chess God.”

He cocked a brow. “Oh, you don’t want to learn? I sense sarcasm.”

“It’s a boring game! Why don’t you explain it in a way I’ll understand?”

Jasper caught my eye, and from the slight curve in his lip and the ignition in his eyes, I knew he understood.

“Well.” Clearing his throat, he picked up a piece and dragged it down several squares before plonking it down on a white space. “If my piece wanted to get to a certain place, it would have to go here.”

I followed his finger as he dragged it across the board. “So far I’ve found—” Jasper caught himself. He twisted around to see if the nurse was watching, and luckily she wasn’t. The boy turned back to me, his lips splitting into a grin. “I mean the piece has found a way out of here.” He prodded the square. “But it’s guarded. And the only way it’s going to get past, is some serious cloak and dagger skills. So. I propose the piece waits until night to make its grand escape.”

Nodding, I was following Jasper’s plan through his confusing narrative of the chess game. I grabbed two pieces, one white and one black, waving them in front of him. “And what about these guys? Are they coming too?”

Jasper’s eyes flickered, and for a moment he looked confused before realisation dawned.

“You’re kidding, right?” Tipping his head back, Jasper blew a raspberry. “Those two—” Catching himself again, he twisted around, a lot more half-assed, to glance at the nurse, before settling me with a frown. “I mean those pieces. Those Chess pieces.” He spoke loudly and I resisted the urge to hit him. Jasper wasn't a fan of the other Spindle subjects, Connor and Joey. 

“Mara, they’re mindless. Even more than me. I might as well be talking to cement.” 

Jasper laughed, his cuffs rattling when he plucked the pieces from my hands and dropped them back on the board. “No, actually, I take that back. Cement is smarter. Cement doesn’t give me a dead eyed look and act like I’m the crazy one for proposing we try and escape.”

I shot him a warning look, my gaze flicking to the nurse who I knew wasn’t deaf. “Be nice.”

“Nice?” Jasper hissed. “I’ve been trying to be nice! It’s like talking to a fucking brick wall!”

My smile dampened. Joey and Connor were all I had, as well as Jasper. Regardless of whatever state they were in, we couldn’t leave them. I gestured to the board, and the chess pieces. “I’m getting through to Connor.”

That was partially a lie. All I’d managed to do was get him to tell me his name, and that he knew me.

That was it. Connor Marlow was a blank slate driven by hopelessness.

A foot soldier was what Luna had called him.

“Oh, really?” he raised a brow. He prodded the piece. “So, you’re saying he has all of his marbles?”

“None of us have our marbles.” I pointed out.. “Including you.”

“At least I have something!” The boy shot back. “My dad wanted me to be a shining light in the dark, or whatever delusional shit. I get that. But Luna did the exact same to you and me. We escaped it. They didn’t. Whatever fucked up shit she did to their heads during and after the update, it’s messed them up. They’re in a—”

Jasper pulled a face, “I don’t know! Like a mental limbo. And so far, they’re shown no sign of coming back. Zero. Zilch."

“Jasper—”

“Mara.” Jasper kept prodding the piece. “You need to let go. He’s not coming back. Or at least the him you knew. Come on, we’ve already established this. He was turned into a freak, and then converted into one of Luna’s psycho minions. Now he’s being controlled by my dad. If we take him with us, who knows what he’ll do!”

I was about to hiss at him to be quiet when the door opened, and Jasper’s dad strode through. He was the face from the back of my mind, the nightmare haunting my younger self. I didn’t look up from the board, glaring at my lap. I wouldn’t look at him. If I did I’d only see the look of sickening satisfaction plastered on his lips.

“Jasper.” He grunted. “Time to go. Miss Delaney has important tests.”

“Right now?” 

Jasper turned to his father with an edge to his tone. Like me, he had no choice but to bow to their orders. He still hadn’t fulfilled his wish to tear off Mycroft’s head and wear it as a hat. “I’m talking to her, dad.”

“I won’t ask again."

Jasper was uncuffed, and before he could be dragged away he leaned over me, wrapping his arms around me. It looked like a hug, and maybe it was, but his lips were suddenly kissing the edge of my ear, warm breath tickling my neck.

“Tonight.” He hissed. “Room 45A is just down the hall from your room. It’s a fire exit disguised as a room. There’s a guard who talks to his wife at midnight exactly, and then he goes to grab food from the café on the first floor. That gives us five minutes to get out. I’ll grab Connor and Joey and bring them, but if they fuck us over, I won’t hesitate in killing them.”

Jasper let out a sharp breath and moved away slightly, though his iron grip on me only tightened.

“It has to be tonight.” He continued, “My dad is blowing this place up tomorrow, and sending us on a suicide mission to recruit the elite’s children, and he’s completely serious. He’s taking us to a base in London, but if we get out we can stop this, Mara. We’ll get out of here--- I don’t know, we’ll go to someone who can actually help us. Outside of Blackwood.” 

Jasper’s words sent chills down my spine, mirroring those of Luna before he brutally murdered her. “I know what you’re thinking,” His voice was soft. “You don’t trust yourself. You don’t trust what’s inside you, and I get that. But it’s better than what my dad’s got planned. Without us, the asshole is nothing.”

“Jasper.” 

“I’m hugging her!” Jasper spat back at his father. “Jeez! You don’t have to hover over me.”

Eventually, he pulled away and caught my eye, his lip curved, eyes wide.

Silent confirmation.

I could only nod, and he smiled back and winked at me, allowing his father to pull him out of the room.

With Jasper gone, I felt a familiar feeling of dread slip into me. But it wasn’t something I didn’t want. Dread was a more lukewarm despair. It wasn’t enough to fill me with euphoria, more of a drug to lull me into reverie.

The tests were always the same.

I was strapped to a bed and reclined under a bright light which burned my eyes. 

Mycroft loomed over me and prodded the back of my head. Words were exchanged between him and the nurse, but I didn’t listen to them. They were looking for Luna,  searching for the reason why she hadn’t taken me over yet. When something sharp and cold sliced into the back of my head, I turned onto my side, staring at the sunlight glinting through the open window. 

I was so grateful for the allure  in the room, singular shards of light bleeding into me and reassuring me that everything was going to be okay. 

Even when I felt Mycroft’s fingers slip inside the back of my head, the cavern that Luna had created, and he had expanded. I often forgot that I’d lost all of my hair. It had been sheared away during my first test so they could get into my head easier. Maybe that was a good thing. 

Every time I had caught my own reflection I didn’t see myself. I saw my mother. I saw her thick dark curls, her strange oblong shaped nose, and her crooked smile. 

So maybe removing parts of myself which had been her was a good thing.

Then I wouldn’t have to remember her.

“Miss Delaney, can you count down from ten for me?”

The prick of the IV in my wrist sent electroshocks down my spine.

“Ten.” I mumbled, already falling, my thoughts crumbling.

“Nine.”

Time seemed to slow down into a confusing sludge of tangled instances.

“Eight.”


….


“Seven.”

Escaping into my mind, I sensed Jasper’s father leaning over me.

“It’s been a while since the virus made an appearance, Mara,” Mycroft cooed. I felt his gloved fingers slick with my blood, a warm gush of wetness leaking down the back of my neck. The feeling of him inside me, his fingers prodding and poking—it reminded me of the virus’s tendrils snaking around my brain and squeezing, making me scream in delight, in pleasure.

It was the same feeling. While my body told me what he was doing was wrong, was foreign, that it should hurt, my brain was too busy choking on bliss. “We want to know what’s going on.” He murmured. 

Ignoring him, I continued my countdown.

“Six.” I whispered.

“Five.”

On four, I was already falling.

Three was barely incomprehensible from my lips.

“Two.” The nurse’s voice was faded, counting along with me—and then her voice was drowned out completely.

“One.” I felt the number curve on my lips, but I was speaking to nothing, a growing emptiness around me.

“Hello, Mara.” Luna’s voice broke out into a yawn.

In the expanse of space I was enveloped in which was neither reality nor slumber, Luna’s presence was suddenly suffocating.

“You’ve been sleeping,” I thought, projecting my voice into my own mind. “Why have you been sleeping? You could have taken over me, and you haven’t. I mean, I’m not complaining. But why so quiet?”

She hummed. “I’m not sure. I’ve been—I guess you could say I’ve been looking for something.”

I could sense myself falling further.

Luna followed me into the spiralling black, the two of us plunging deeper and deeper into oblivion.

“Something?” I said into the void, “What are you talking about?”

As usual, I was greeted to her laugher. Though it was weak and faded, a low hum in the back of my skull.  

“I’m looking for a lost part of me,” she said. “What created me, the idea of me; a mind filled with despair, so torn and corrupted. So unsavable. I’m talking about before Aurora. What made her into who she came to be.”

“What?”

Her words tangled inside me.

“That was Rory.” I told her. “What Mycroft did to her. All those experiments! That’s what created you!”

“Mmm, part of me.” Luna said. “But still. I’m not—how should I say this? I’m not completely whole. Without my missing piece. And…” Her voice fluttered around me, like she was dancing around and around and around me.

“I’m hoping to find the lost parts of me in you, Mara.” She said. “So, we’re going to deep-dive.”

“Deep dive?”

“Your memories, silly! I want to know where I began. I want to know the mind which created me.”

What she was saying -- it wasn’t making sense.

Why… why would the reason for the virus’s birth be inside my head?

I didn’t have time to question her, because Luna’s presence was bleeding away, and I was someplace else, seeping into the crevices of my own mind. 

When clarity came through, I was sitting in my mother’s car, glaring at my seven-year-old self in a small mirror. The radio was playing some pop song, and in front of me was the long, winding snake of traffic sitting in the late summer sun.

I tugged at a red ribbon tangled in my dark curls, scowling. Next to me, my mom nodded her head to a steady beat, smooth hands gripping the steering wheel.

I could sense the annoyance radiating from her. We were late. Again.

“I don’t like it.” I said, pulling harder at the ribbon.

“Hm?” Mom’s gaze left the traffic and landed on me. “Why? Mara, you look pretty.”

I glared at the ribbon tangled in my small hands. With another tug, I pulled it out.

“I don’t like red.” I stuffed the red down my seat, my ears stinging. “It reminds me of—"

I swallowed my words, exhaling out a breath.

Blood. It reminded me of the red stain pooling down my Mickey Mouse pyjamas when thundercracks of pain struck the back of my head. It reminded me of waking up with mom sitting in front of me with glistening eyes.

“Mara!” Her voice echoed. “It’s okay! It’s just a nosebleed. We’re going to help you, sweetie.”

Several months later I was on my way to my tenth check-up after being diagnosed with a rare neurological condition which, according to Harvey Mycroft our town Doctor, would only get worse if it was left untreated.

“Mara.” Mom’s tone startled me. She didn’t look away from the road, but her hand found mine, entangling with my fingers. “What did we say earlier, sweetie? We said we were going to talk about nice things from now on.”

Which meant no mentions of blood, or headaches, or feeling sick.

“Okay, mommy.” I turned my attention to the window and didn’t speak until mom was parking in Blackwood Children Surgery’s parking lot. 

“I don’t want to go.” I mumbled, purposely dragging my feet.

Mom ignored me, her grip on my hand tightening. I watched my shadow dance across the tarmac as she pulled me from the car. Behind me I saw Lucas Aisling and his mother hurrying behind us. Both of them were also late.

“Mommy.” I lifted my voice when mom yanked open the doors to the building, and I was momentarily startled when a cool blast of air hit me in the face. Blackwood Children’s Surgery was a small glass building on the edge of town. It had three rooms that I knew. The reception area, the waiting room, and Mr Mycroft's office. 

“I want to go home.”

When I gave up being quiet and shouted it instead, she sighed.

“Mara, don’t be ridiculous. Mr Mycroft is going to help you.”

“I don’t want help! I want to go home.”

The reception area was small and homely, and the woman’s name behind the desk was Melanie.

“Mara!” Melanie smiled widely when I peeked behind my mom. “How are you doing today?”

I glared at my shoes. “I don’t like this place.”

The receptionist laughed. “Oh, it’s not that bad!”

When I didn’t reply, mom and Melanie fell into conversation, and I was left to wander around the room.

Though I didn’t get far—when I sensed him.

The primary reason why I didn’t want to be there was standing behind me. 

He was always hanging around the reception area when I walked in with mom, and that day was no different. 

When I twisted around, I glimpsed a familiar head of red curls leaning against the wall, hiding behind a large book. The boy caught my eye, scowling.

Joey was my least favourite kid at Blackwood Children’s surgery.

I stuck out my tongue at him.  “I don’t have Squishy.”

“Squishy” was Joey Summer’s hamster. He’d brought Squishy in a week earlier to show all the kids, but it had mysteriously disappeared. Joey thought I was the one who took Squishy because I was the last one to hold her.

He didn’t peek from behind the book. “Liar.”

Anger bubbled inside me. I lunged forward, tearing the book from his grasp. “I told you I don’t have Squishy!”

The boy curled his lip.  “Yes you do. I bet you have her in your pocket.”

“No, I don’t!” I shoved him into the wall. “I don’t even like stupid hamsters!”

When the boy burst into tears, Melanie hurrying over to comfort him, mom grabbed my shoulder gently.

“Mara, please stop fighting with the other children.”

“But I’m not—”

She cut me off, ducking to meet my height and cradling my face. Mom always looked like she was going to cry when she said goodbye. “Your appointment is in ten minutes. Go and play with the others, okay?” She pointed through the door. “You like playing with Rory and I heard there’s a Sleeping Beauty book in the big box of toys.”

"I’ve read it.”

Mom chuckled, squeezing my hands. “Read it again! It’s your favourite!”

I wiped my eyes. “Joey’s being mean.”

Mom frowned. “What did I tell you to do?”

“Throw a book at his face?”

“No! No, Mara, we ignore kids who make us sad.”

I nodded, hugged my mother goodbye, and found the waiting room. Rory wasn’t there, though. The only kids were Joey Summer’s, who was sitting on his own with his head buried in his knees, and Lucas Aisling piling crayons on top of each other, slumped on a bright yellow bean bag. 

I went over to the table to grab crayons, but Lucas snatched them away, insisting he needed all of them. I looked for toys to play with, but they were all for babies. The Sleeping Beauty book was missing, so it looked like Rory had already taken it with her.

I didn’t want to sit with Joey, who kept sending me death glares, so after a while of counting the ceiling tiles and then pretending the floor was lava—only to be stopped when I almost cracked my head on the side of the table jumping across the sofa, I decided that I needed to go to the bathroom. I didn’t really need to go, but I was bored and I wanted to explore.

The reception area and waiting room were separated by a pane of glass so Melanie could keep an eye on us.

I raised my hand, and she looked up from her computer. “Mara,” Her voice crackled through the speaker.

"You don’t need to put your hand up.”

“I need to go to the bathroom.” I said, and when she frowned, I pretended to squirm. “Like, really.”

“I bet you flushed Squishy down the toilet.” Joey mumbled into his knees, and Lucas giggled.

I ignored them. It was so much better when Rory was there—or even Connor Marlow.

“Pleaseeeee? I’ll be really quick!”

Melanie sighed. “Okay, fine. But you need to hurry up. Do you need me to come with you?”

I shook my head. “I’m a big girl. I can go on my own.”


Melanie’s lips twitched into a smile. “I’ll give you candy if you come back quickly! Do you remember where it is?”

“Uh-huh.” I knew I didn’t have a good brain, and it was broken. Sometimes I didn’t remember certain things. That was why I was there, after all. But I did remember where the bathroom was. It was down the hall, and it had a big green door. I nodded, my attention suddenly on the prospect of getting candy. “Do I get chocolate?”

Melanie held up a bag of Sour Patch Kids and my mouth watered. “Two of these. Do we have a deal?”

I jumped up, giggling. “Deal.”

Shooting a smug look at the boy’s, because I got to go exploring and they didn’t, I pushed back through the waiting room doors leading out onto a carpeted hallway. The bathroom was at the very end of the hall but I turned and went the other way, skipping past each door.

The rooms I passed were nothing special. They were just observation rooms, ones I knew. Reaching the end of the hall there was an elevator, and one more door.

This time the door was slightly open, flickering light bleeding through. Curiosity moved me closer and closer until I was stepping over the threshold. A small boy was sitting cross legged on an observation bed. He had dark curls and stripy socks which I was immediately envious of. 

In his hands was a games controller. Mom didn’t let me play video games. She said they were bad for my brain. Looking at the TV, though, the game the boy was playing looked fun. I was seeing a grand colourful landscape. A small purple dragon was swooping across the sky with huge wings, following a throng of glistening gems. The boy’s gaze was stuck to the screen as he mashed buttons.

I knocked three times on the door. “What are you doing?”

“Playing Spyro.” The boy yawned, his gaze not leaving the screen.

I nodded, stepping into the room and shutting the door behind me. “I don’t know that game.”

“It’s old.” He said. “It’s the only game that’s not boring.”

I bounced over to him, jumping onto the bed. “What’s the dragon called?”

The boy shot me a grin. “Spyro!” He held up the controller. “Do you wanna play?”

Excitement flooded me and I nodded. “Can I? Really?”

The boy paused the game. “You can get me more gems.”

When he passed me the controller, I pressed buttons and manically waggled the analog stick. 

“Are you sick too?” I asked, stabbing X.

"I think so."

“Oh.” I pulled a face, shuffling away a little. I didn’t want to get sick.

“I’m Mara.” I told him from a safe distance. “What’s yours?”

“Jasper.” He said. “I like your name. It sounds like a Princess.” He poked my dress. “Princess Mara.”

I pretended to courtesy. “Okay! I’ll be a Princess, and you can be my Prince!”

The two of us played for a while. Jasper had to help me jump onto high places. When I complained it was too hard, he laughed. I liked his laugh. I liked his stripy socks and the way his body seemed to vibrate with his giggles. I was collecting more sparkly gems when I turned to Jasper with a curious smile. The question had been on my mind since we’d started playing. “Jasper?” I kept mashing buttons until the dragon did a big jump into the air.

“Yeah?” The reflection of the game danced in his eyes.

“Why is the controller sticky?” I held out my palm, frowning at red smeared all of my fingers. When I made a fist, the colour brightened. It was bright red. Like the ribbon I’d pulled out of my hair, like all of my nosebleeds.

A sharp gasp of delight thrumming in the back of my skull pulled me from the memory for a moment.

“Oh, right!” Luna’s voice was louder, stronger, slamming into me. “How could I have missed it?”

I wanted to understand what she was talking about, but all I really had to do was look at my little selves’ hands.

“From the moment of birth, Jasper Mycroft felt like there was something perhaps wrong with him. He got bored easily. He… how should I put this? He understood things—almost to a frightening degree. As a young child, he developed speech early and passed all of the typical milestones before other children. Crawling. Walking. Speech. Jasper could read full sentences by the age of three years old. A genius, some might have called him.”

Luna chuckled. “But not to him. Jasper hated it. He hated always being right. His own intelligence plagued him. Everything made too much sense. . Because the more Jasper understood the world and learned how it worked— everything became far too.. well, boring, for him. While his classmates struggled to take in basic knowledge, Jasper already knew it. So much so that as he grew up, life became unbearable. It was too easy. Everything was too easy. His friends made sense. His family. Basic addition and subtraction. Holidays. Birthdays. Everything made too much sense and there was nothing to solve. When a problem pretended itself, he knew the answer within seconds.” The virus trickled inside me, her voice filling me up. “But do you know what didn’t make sense?”

Luna’s words enveloped my seven-year-old selves’ sharp cry when I shuffled back, dropping the controller.

“Why is the controller sticky?” I couldn’t breathe, my heart in my throat.

“Jasper found solace in one particular thing. The inability to not know what was coming,” Luna whispered.

“Something he couldn’t understand, couldn’t make sense of. Pain. When he stabbed his leg with the nib of a pencil and found that it didn’t hurt as much as he’d thought. In fact, he felt something different. Instead of feeling spider webbing stinging climbing up his leg, Jasper felt… happy. He felt joy. Because in that moment he couldn’t make sense of that feeling in his leg, and no matter how hard he tried to understand it, going over it in that big booming brain of his, it gave no answer.”

Luna giggled. “And with pain, Jasper found hopelessness. When his aunt grew sick and ended up in hospital, he visited just to watch the life drain from her to face, her eyes growing hollow. It excited him. Finally! Something which didn’t make sense! Jasper had no idea if his aunt was going to die or survive, but the anticipation of knowing it was soon, knowing that her time was running out, it filled him with incomprehensible joy. On the night she passed, he sneaked into her room and pulled out her breathing tube. He wanted to see what it was like, to feel the breath leave your lungs, to choke on air that was suddenly so hard to breathe in.” 

The delight in Luna’s tone was sending my thoughts spiralling as I balanced between my own present mind, and the ten year old memory bleeding through. “Jasper didn’t kill his aunt that night, Mara.” 

She paused for effect. 

“He stood over her bed and held the breathing tube above her, close enough for her to grab. The pain and fear in her eyes snapped something inside him—and he realised that he wanted others to feel what his aunt was feeling. He didn’t want his loved ones to die. He wanted them to suffer like his aunt had. He wanted them to drown in their own hopelessness, enveloping darkness plunging them into oblivion. Because why wouldn’t they want to go through that? He thought. This was the best feeling he’d ever felt! Complete, unbridled despair tearing him inside out. Intoxicating a broken mind.”

I tried to jump off of the bed, dangling my feet, but my socks landed in something… warm.

“Dunno.” Jasper shrugged and turned back to the game. “Does it make you sad, Mara?”

“Mara!” The receptionist’s voice hit me, and I turned to find her standing in the doorway. Melanie didn’t look like she usually did. She wasn’t smiling, and her cheeks were pale. Her eyes zeroed in on my bloody hands.

“Oh, oh, god. Mara, come here sweetie.” She pulled something out of her pocket with trembling hands. “Mr Mycroft, we have a— a situation with your son.” She hissed out. But she didn’t make any move towards me. Her gaze flicked to the boy on the bed, who was frowning at her, his head cocked.  “Harvey, he’s done it again. He's done it again!"

I couldn’t help it. I ducked under the bed and glimpsed what looked like an explosion of red. It was everywhere, splattered on the floor. I glimpsed bits of fur and flecks of white. And I knew immediately what it was. Squishy.

Something warm crept up my throat and I swallowed it down, slamming my hand over my mouth. Jasper hung upside down, smiling widely, his eyes shining. “Do you want to see what the inside of a hamster's brain looks like?”

When I didn't speak, he grinned. "It's all wiggly."

“Stop.” I whispered, choking out a sob. “Stop!”

I slammed my hands over my mouth, but it didn’t seem to faze him.

He followed me, jumping off the bed. His stripy socks sinking into pooling scarlet.


"Do you want to know a secret, Princess Mara?”

Leaning in close, his warm breath tickling my ear. "I did it to make Connor cry." Jasper giggled. "Cry, like a baby."

He held out his hands. "See! Hamster brains!"

"Mara." the receptionist wrapped her arms around me. "Mr Mycroft’s son is-- he's sick. Please, stay away."

“Now, here’s the best part.” Luna’s voice echoed in my head as I was dragged away by the receptionist.

“Did the question never cross your mind?” The virus teased.

“Why exactly was Jasper’s father so obsessed with the idea of twisting the human mind into a monster?”

When I didn’t reply, my focus on my screaming younger self, Luna continued.

“Harvey Mycroft, once coming to the conclusion that his son’s mind did not work the way it should have, that there was something twisted and wrong with his brain—he began to have nightmares of a seven-year-old Jasper standing on top of a burning building, looking out onto an apocalyptic wasteland."

My little selve's screams deafened me. 

"He couldn’t understand why it had to be his son who would eventually bring the world to its knees. He drove himself crazy looking for a cure, a way to cleanse his son of this evil which had taken hold from birth. So, being as unhinged as dear Jasper, he decided that it wouldn’t be the case. It would be the opposite. Jasper wouldn’t destroy the world, as fate had written. He would save it. It wouldn’t be his son, fascinated, revelling in agony and pain because it was the only thing that didn’t bore him— it would be everyone else who would bow to the dark, while Jasper would be the light.” Luna’s presence was so close, I felt her kissing my ear. “How about that, hmm? That’s quite the plot twist.”

The memory slipped away, and I was left suspended in my own mind, suffocating in Luna’s shadow.

I felt her coming to life, blooming inside my mind as the drugs began to wear off. I was resurfacing in a reality I didn’t want to go back to. Now that she had found her missing piece she was strong enough to take over. And I felt that. I felt her leeching onto my mind and body, dripping into my thoughts. She was getting stronger, blossoming into my being and shoving me further back, and I hurtled deeper and deeper. “Now, Imagine,” Her voice was sing-song. “Imagine that missing piece, that corrupted and broken mind filled with darkness, hollowed out and forced to wear a façade all this time. Ten years of being supressed and purged into a beacon of light.”

Her last words were a shrill squeak before I was forced into the dark—while she opened my eyes.

“What if I just woke it up?”

... 

Sorry, I had to cut it off there. We’re on the move so I’ve got to write quickly.  


I’ll post more soon.

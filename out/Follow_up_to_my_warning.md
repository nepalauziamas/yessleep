My last post on this sub was a warning, about those "twins". I feel like I owe it to those that saw my warning to come back and give a follow up. I'm fine and so is my cat. I killed the fucker in the mirror, I beat it over the head with a pipe I ripped out of my toilet. They crawl out of the mirrors like that bitch from the Ring. Your fight or flight will kick in faster than you think, you have about 7 seconds from the moment their hand crosses from the mirror into our world. Don't hold eye contact with them, in fact try not to look at them at all, that's how they get you. As far as I know it has to be YOUR twin that catches you, I've looked at others and nothing has happened. Unfortunately killing one twin will kill the original person, something I found out the hard way while defending myself from my friend's twin (and himself unfortunately). They mirror each other actions perfectly and will try to choke you with both sets of hands, if a pair kills someone this way they take the dead person's eyes. I don't know why but I've seen a few pairs walking around with ziplock bags filled with eyes.

For those of you still concerned, yes I got my cat out, he's in his carrier right now looking rather offended that I would keep him in a box for so long but I wanna keep him safe. His name's Pebble and we both have enough food and water for at least a few more days. We're hiding out in the local strip mall in a clothing store because it has the most hiding places. We house hopped for a little while but there's just too many windows in most of the houses so we ended up at the mall.

To cut to the chase, I'm actually following up because of a development that came up yesterday. There's two kids here that have joined me and Pebble. A boy and a girl, both around 10 or 11. I'm only 20 and never hung around kids much so my parenting skills are nil, add the current circumstances and well I hope you get the picture. We're all secure here but when we have to move I'm worried they might get us into trouble. The twin pairs outside have started making noises no human could ever make and if these kids get too scared and give our position away it could get messy. I've checked the back and there is an emergency exit but it's alarmed and I don't know what's on the other side of it. The only real weapons we have are scissors and the pipe I brought and somehow I don't think that's enough for the lot of us to put up much of a fight. The boy actually suggested something really smart, he said he didn't see anyone get back into any of the cars still in the lot so there could be keys inside one or two of them. The only issue is we'd still have to run a ways through the parking lot to get to even the closest vehicle and who knows if it's even unlocked.
(Side note, yes the two have befriended Pebble and yes I'm stoked that there's at least some light for them in all this.)

I'm thinking if we wait till the power goes out maybe the alarm on the back door won't work and we can slip out at night. I'm not sure if it runs on backup power but it seems like the safest option. I don't know when the power will cut off but it's been close to three days now I think and the lights still work. I've gotta go and check on all of them now but any advice or insight would be much appreciated. My phone is probably going to run out of charge soon so my next follow up, if there even is one, could take a while. Stay safe out there and remember, break your mirrors.

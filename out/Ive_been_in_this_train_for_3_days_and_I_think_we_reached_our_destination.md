It was just another day, or should I say night. After I finished my shift at the supermarket I worked at, I bought a few things, mostly food, and headed to the train station as usual. I looked the clock on my wrist and realized that I missed the train I usually took and that there was just one more that would bring me home.

The train I waited for arrived exactly 45 minutes later. I got on, chose a seat at the back and dozed off. The only thing I remember before falling asleep was that the train had at max a dozen people, other than me.

I woke up roughly 15 minutes later and since there were another 15 minutes until I arrived at my station, so I fell asleep again, assuming that the robotic voice announcing every station would wake me up.

As I predicted, I woke up just as the voice pronounced my station. But the train wasn't slowing down. It was almost going faster. I looked at the glowing red screen which displayed each station. It was showing the next station after mine. I decided to stay awake and get off at the next station and from there I would walk home.

I just sat there observing my surroundings. I realised that behind the windows was just darkness, as if we were travelling through a tunnel.

I waited until the next station was called, but again, the train didn't stop. I looked around me and saw that all the people around me just looked numb and remained seated. I started panicking and I wanted to call the police, because maybe the train was being hijacked and they would stop the train at the next station, but even though I had service, it wouldn't let me open my phone app.

I wasn't able to remain awake for a long time, since I was tired, so without realising I dozed off again. This time it was way longer than a nap. I woke up some time later and looked at my clock. 7:03 am. How was I still in the train? How was it still going? I looked through the windows again and only darkness greeted me.

I noticed that there were fewer people than when I boarded the train. I took a chocolate bar out of my grocery bag. With the amount of food I had bought, I could survive for a few days in the train. Although I wasn't thinking the train could go for that long.

I was wrong. I thought an eternity had passed since I last stepped on ground. It has been 3 days, if my phone is correct, since I got on this train. People got on and off, but the train never stopped. Nobody said anything.

At the end of the third day, I noticed that the blackness had been replaced by a red glow. Pinkish water greeted me when I peeked through the window. The sky itself was pink.  It honestly looked like something out of a sci-fi movie.

I hadn't notice the shore of an island.

The train stopped as it was just entering the confines of the patch of land. Something urged me to get off, even though I didn't want to. It was almost like an unseen force dragging me onto the surreal ground. Just as exited, I heard the doors behind me closing and the train speeding off.

The only thing on the barren island was a shack that looked strangely familiar. All around the walls of it were words drawn in a bright red that said "They left me here". It was my handwriting.

I realised why the shack looked out of a memory. It was the same shack I had burned my last victim in. Nobody ever found their remains. Just as I came to terms with this, the door slowly creaked open.

“Things still aren’t adding up for me, guys.”

Sheriff Murray Roundtree didn’t seem like a bad man or a stupid one, but he was beginning to get irritating.  In the two weeks since Tommy’s alleged suicide, Janie and I had already been questioned both together and then separately by one of the deputies working on the case—John Roundtree, the sheriff’s son.  The second interview had been after they figured out from talking to Tommy’s boss that we’d been behind the grocery store talking to the young man just hours before he died.

Our story then was the same as it was now:  Janie was my granddaughter.  We were on a road trip and decided to stop by Tulset County so she could visit Tommy, a friend she’d made online a few months earlier.  We were both shocked and saddened by him suddenly taking his own life, but no, we hadn’t known he was suicidal and didn’t see him again after leaving the store.  Clean, simple, and unverifiable in its falsehoods.  

Our fake identities had been meticulously created, and short of scrutiny by someone with several orders of magnitude more resources and expertise than the Tulset County’s Sheriff’s Office, they should hold up.  Not that they were too behind the times here.  Their entire system was networked and backed up to the cloud, including all of their camera systems.  I knew that because Janie’s people had hacked into it within three hours of us finding out about Tommy’s death.  The rear security cameras at the grocery store—and a couple of other spots where people might remember us—weren’t as easy to access.  But, when I had her hackers cross-check the locations with concerning cameras against prior incident reports at the sheriff’s office, it became clear that the grocery store used an old system that recorded over old footage every twenty-four hours and the other cameras of concern were either inoperable or just for live feeds.  Nothing could be guaranteed, but it seemed that when we got ready to go, almost every credible trace of us having been there at all would be erased as soon as I gave the word.

And yet, here we still sat.

Part of it was because I needed time to prepare for our next encounter, and trying to keep a lower profile made that process even slower than it would otherwise have been.  But the other issue was this sheriff, who in trying to do his job, was keeping a much closer eye on us than if we were just normal strangers passing through his sleepy little town.  We’d been vague and steadfast in our statements, but overall very cooperative.  Nevertheless, Sheriff Roundtree was unsatisfied, and I was growing impatient.

“What’s that, Sheriff?”  

He glanced at me when I asked the question, but quickly shifted his gaze back to Janie.  His son had done the same thing.  Focused on her when it came time to plea for help and wheedle for more information.  Try to compel her to disclose some new detail by playing on the tragedy of this young man’s death who was, supposedly, her friend.  And perhaps that’s all it was.  She was the one with the “friendship” with Tommy, so it made sense she’d be more emotionally involved.  Or maybe they thought that being a young woman, she would be easier to control or persuade.  Weaker in some element of mind or spirit than they were.  They were very mistaken.

“Honey, I know Tommy was your friend.  But we’ve just…we’ve looked at his phone, talked to his Mom, and well…it didn’t seem like Tommy had many friends, and we can’t see any sign of you anywhere.”

Janie smiled at him sweetly.  “Like I told you, Murray, we had never met in person.  Just talked through the internet.  I can’t say what he had on his phone or not, but it doesn’t surprise me that people here didn’t know about us being friends.”

The sheriff winced slightly when she used his first name.  He’d come in at the tail end of his son’s second interview with her the week before, and at the time he’d thought it would be useful to tell her just to call him Murray.  Because it was all just a casual conversation between friends, right?  She’d found the ploy as absurd as I did, and had made it a point to call him by his first name ever since.  Leaning back in his chair, he looked up at the stained ceiling tiles in the cramped and messy office.

“Okay…well, let me think…Do you think we could get access to your phone and see some of the conversations on your end, then?”  Now we were getting to the real reason for this latest conversation.  A rehearsed request he was trying to play off as a spontaneous idea.  “Just something so we can put this all to bed and I can quit bugging you and your grandfather while you’re on your trip to…where did you say you were going?”

I smiled thinly at him.  “We didn’t.  Just out on the road with my granddaughter.  Exploring America.  Isn’t that right, Janie?”

Giving me a grin, she nodded.  “Yep.”  Her face hardened slightly as she looked back at the sheriff.  “To answer your question, Murray, yes I do mind.  I have private things on my phone and this is a difficult enough time for me without having a stranger invade my privacy.”  She stopped suddenly, her eyes going wide.  “Unless…I mean, do you have a search warrant?  Because if you have a search warrant for my phone or anything else that I own, I will totally cooperate.”  She leaned forward, the smile back on her face.  “So do you?  Murray?”

The man’s face turned red as he sat up straight again, glaring at her.  “Listen, no we don’t, but if you think that…”

“Because this is a suicide, correct, Sheriff?”

The man blinked and shifted his gaze to me.  “Yeah.  So far, yeah.”

“No criminal suspects because there is no discernable crime, correct?”

The sheriff grimaced.  “Well in this state, suicide *is* a crime but…other than that, no.  But there are still things that I want to understand and…”

“I’m sure there are, Sheriff.  Tragedy tends to bring up questions without satisfactory answers.  But harassing two strangers isn’t going to get you closer to the truth, I can assure you.”

“I’m not harassing you.  I’m doing my damn job.  And not trying to be ugly, but something is off about you two.  About all of this.  And I’m not buying it.”

Janie laughed and stood up.  “That’s good, Murray.  Because we’re not fucking selling it.”  She smirked at me.  “Grandpa, you promised me pancakes for lunch.”

Letting out a long-suffering sigh, I shrugged and stood up with exaggerated slowness.  “I did, Sheriff, I did.  Sorry we can’t be of more help but…well, we do appreciate all the work you do keeping this place safe.”

As we started for the door, Sheriff Roundtree stood up.  “Now hold on just a…”

I turned and stared at him. “No.  We’ve indulged you long enough.  I don’t expect to see you again while we are here.  You or your deputies.  Or you will find yourself occupied by a great many more concerns than that poor, troubled boy’s death.  Do you understand?”

His face had paled and was a pinwheel of emotions—anger, fear, confusion and uncertainty.  Dropping his gaze, he picked up a random file from the stack on his desk and pretended to look at it.  “Just get out.”

“Good day, Sheriff.”

**** 

Janie crowed laughter around a mouthful of pancakes.  “I thought he was going to have a stroke.”

I snickered and took another sip of coffee.  We’d been sticking primarily to the same diner since the suicide, but it wasn’t much of a sacrifice.  They had good food and better coffee and…I felt a stab of guilt as I thought about Jason.

Janie’s face sank into a frown.  “What’s wrong?”

Shaking my head slightly, I turned to stare out the window.  “Just…I’m enjoying this.  I hate that the boy is dead, whether it was a suicide or not, and of course I’m excited about a potential path to finding Jason, but I…”  I blinked as my vision started to blur.  “I sit here eating an omelet and drinking coffee, talking to you, being on a real hunt again, even if it’s of a different sort, and I find times where I forget about him.  Just for a few minutes, but I still forget and have a few moments of happiness while he is trapped in that…place.”

She reached out and touched my arm.  “Patrick, there’s no harm in that.  No sin.  You feeling guilty for not being miserable every second of every day is dumb.  It’s been months.  You can’t live like that.  No one can.  And even if you wanted to, I don’t know your brain would let you.”  Janie gave me a smile.  “I get it.  I do.  I deal with the same thing with Martin.  And I was way more to blame for what happened to him than…”  

She trailed off, and behind me I heard footsteps approaching, the sound and gait of a large man.  Glancing up, I saw he was in his early fifties, and he looked like the poster boy for small-town living:  handsome, friendly, and laid back as he ambled up to our table and glanced around before giving us an easy grin.

“Sorry to interrupt your lunch, folks.  I just heard through a friend that you’ve been asking about me.  Thought it was about time we met.”  He stuck out his hand.  [“I’m Dylan.”](https://redd.it/9ndww5)

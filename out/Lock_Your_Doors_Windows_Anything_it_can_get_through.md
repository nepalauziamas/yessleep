I hear it knocking on my doors, on my Windows, I can hear it through the walls. It’s too loud it’s everywhere. I’m writing this holed up in my room in the corner the corner farthest from any doors or windows. I’m trying to cover myself up with a blanket but I know they can still get me. Why did I take the crown? I don’t know. 

It all started three months ago on my trip to Hawaii I was walking on a path and found a cave. When I had gone inside there were markings on the wall. I walked in further curiosity getting the best of me, I should’ve turned around, walked out, went back to my hotel. I didn’t do that though and walked right into what I would regret for as long as I live.

Along the walls were markings carved into the stone, paint covered the wall and when I touched it my hand came away sticky with red ooze. I rubbed my hand on my pants getting most of the ooze off and continued walking further. My shoes kept getting stuck to the floor and made a squeaking noise when I walked. 

When I had reached three paths I chose the middle thinking that would be the best option, I was wrong. The farther you walk in the more it compels you to walk in further. The more you see the more you crave what’s in the cave. It makes u sick, sick with longing to go in further, and once you get in far enough you reach a door. The door was taller than me and was covered in vines. I pulled the handles hearing the door creak, once I had pulled out the door enough for me to squeeze through, I was in an even bigger room than before. In the middle of this room was a coffin, water spouted from all around it creating a pool of water on the floor. My shoes were soaked yet I walked deeper into it. Pulling the lid of the coffin open, inside was a skeleton holding a marvelous golden crown.

I was dazzled by the delicious color of it. It drew you in, forcing you to pick it up. I pulled it out of the skeletons hands and watched as it glowed in my hands. The light in the room just hitting it right to give it that gleam. As i Held it I woke up in my hotel room bed. I looked around and saw my boots on the floor along with the crown. By the end of my trip I had brought the crown home and had it sitting on display in my room. That was a big mistake. Now here I am sitting shivering. 

It feels like hours have passed since they started knocking its driving me crazy. Why can’t they leave me alone? My door had started to creak under the pressure of the knocking and collapsed when the final knocks sounded. Black figures waltzed in and in the chaos I saw the same skeleton I had taken the crown from. I screamed and was now trapped with them in the tomb waiting for the next victim to appear falling for the trick.
